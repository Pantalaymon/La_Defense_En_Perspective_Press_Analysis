<titre>Racing's majestic late try stuns Saracens to knock holders out of Champions Cup</titre>
<auteur>MICK CLEARY</auteur>
<texte>
		And so an era ends for Saracens, a time of notable glory but also of controversy, a stain forever etched on their reputations despite the typically lung-busting, gritty, defiant play on show at <meronyme id="1643">La Defense Arena</meronyme>, qualities that have brought them countless trophies but were not enough to deny Racing 92 a place in their third European final in five seasons.  
		 Saracens are consigned to be wanderers in the Covid-afflicted wasteland of professional rugby, already relegated and with little prospect of rugby in the Championship until well into next year. It is also adieu to Europe for two years for the three-time winners, maybe even longer. The head-drooped ranks of Saracens players made for a forlorn sight at the final whistle. At least they went out on their shields in the Champions Cup and not damned by misdeed as they were in the Premiership. In that regard Saracens were as Saracens have always been – gnarly, spirited and selfless. At least they perished in noble fashion. 
		Fittingly, it took the miracle-worker that is Racing fly-half, Finn Russell, to roll back the stone and help his side rise from the seeming dead when sparking the match-clinching try for Juan Imhoff just four minutes from time. Up to that moment it appeared as if Saracens’ tight, restricted game had once again stifled an opposition with Racing trailing for much of the second half. It had been a crabby, fretful, error-strewn game and Saracens made fit to do as they had done in Dublin seven days earlier and defy the odds to claim a surprise victory. 
		 But Russell has genius in his Scottish genes, a sense of adventure and possibility in every action, scanning for openings, alert to everything. Racing were badly in need of some Houdini activity and Russell provided it with a deft little chip over the on-rushing defence, a pre-planned move that saw the ball drop into the hands (with a little heart-stopping fumble) of Virimi Vakatawa. The powerhouse centre was off and away, stepping and fending, finding Russell on the outside when finally felled, the ball swiftly shipped on to Imhoff for the try that ignited <mention id="1644">La Defense</mention> with a 1,000 fans permitted and which, equally, sent despair into Saracens’ souls. 
		 Sport rarely provides for sentimental send-offs and there was to be no on-field final whistle salutations for the man who has epitomised the selfless essence of Saracens over the past 12 years, captain Brad Barritt being led groggily from the pitch in the 65th minute after getting smacked on the head by stray bodies piling into a ruck. Even the usually reliable Barritt was slightly off-key, spilling a ball in contact at one point, a flaw that captured the tone of the match.  
		 Saracens have been on their relative uppers as regards depth of squad. Barritt was not the only casualty. The Londoners needed to keep a full complement on the field for as long as possible, so the sight of a stricken Duncan Taylor being forced off in the 13th minute with a shoulder problem following a collision with the huge slab that is Vakatawa would have caused furrowed brows in the ranks of Sarries supporters. 
		 Yet the Saracens mantra held good: one man falls, another steps forward. And former England under 20 centre, Dom Morris, filled the breach admirably. Morris, an Academy product, was true to all those deep-rooted virtues of the club. It was Morris who spotted in the 51st minute that Racing were playing too fast and loose across their own 22 and nailed Simon Zebo with a ball-spilling tackle. From there, Saracens were to win their second scrum penalty within seven minutes which Alex Goode duly converted to take his team clear at 15-9. 
		 There was even more invigorating stuff to come from Morris when he burst upfield and tore deep into Racing territory, striding strongly but running out of support, Racing getting back to clear. Moments later it was the turn of Alex Lewington to almost break the try-deadlock. The Saracens wing, though, was not able to keep his balance when gathering, allowing the opposition defence to scramble back. Lewington would have been better suited to toe-poking the ball up towards the Racing try-line. 
		 These were the fleeting moments of opportunity for Saracens. They had managed to take their one gilt-edged opening against Leinster and it brought great dividends. There was to be no repeat act of salvation. They had to strive for every point. The scrum was once again prominent until the forward pack tired in the second-half as Racing were able to replenish from the bench. 
		 The Vunipola brothers, Mako and Billy, combined to good effect at one juncture but there was little space, little fluency and few clear chances. It was left to the goal-kickers to take what was on offer, Goode knocking over a couple of first-half pots at goal only for Racing’s Teddy Iribaren, to trump him with three successful kicks to send his team into the half-time interval with a narrow lead. 
		 That changed as Saracens managed to find momentum after the break with Morris doing some damage and Goode exacting due reward for the fine labours of his mates in the scrum. 
		 Racing, though, have been yearning for a European title. The Parisian high-rollers have recruited accordingly. Russell repaid on that investment with a piece of artistry that would not have been out of place in the Louvre. 
		 The strobe lights flitted round the enclosed arena at the final whistle, framing scenes of desolation and of joy. For Saracens, tomorrow is a long time hence.

		Charlie's not wrong 
		Dom Morris was ace when he came on for the injured Duncan Taylor. 
		 26 Sep 2020-03:00PM BST 
		Racing's winning try 
		26 Sep 2020-03:00PM BST 
		Full-time: Racing 19 Saracens 15  
		Saracens go wide immediately off the scrum but Daly's pass cannot find Maitland, and the Scottish wing is bundled into touch as he gathers the loose ball. 
		 That's the end. Heartbreaking for Saracens, for whom it is the end of an era. 
		 Racing, however, were lethal; scoring the game's only try. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:57PM BST 
		79 min: Racing 19 Saracens 15 
		Racing kick to the corner after Daly mindlessly plays the scrum-half at a ruck. 
		 But they knock on-again-and Saracens will have one last shot to win the game; they will have to do it from just outside their own 22. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:55PM BST 
		78 min: Racing 19 Saracens 15  
		Goodness me, we've had them all today from Nigel Owens. Earlier he pinged Racing for not using the ball quickly enough at a ruck, and now he's pulled up Saracens at the restart for being in front of the kicker. 
		 Scrum to Racing on halfway and this is slipping away from Saracens. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:53PM BST 
		CON MACHENAUD Racing 19 Saracens 15 
		A significant if easy conversion for Machenaud; Saracens now need a try. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:51PM BST 
		TRY IMHOFF Racing 17 Saracens 15  
		Totally out of nowhere. Total class. 
		 Saracens had been warned about this. Racing meander in an attack on halfway before, in an instant, they are gone. 
		 Russell chips over, pre-called, and Vakatawa takes on the full. He bursts upfield, offloads to Russell who is in the clear, but the fly-half sensibly shovels on to the lightning Imhoff, and Daly cannot get to him. 
		 Clinical, ruthless, and thrilling; it might have won Racing the game. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:49PM BST 
		75 min: Racing 12 Saracens 15  
		Saracens penalty from the scrum! 
		 Oz gets too long and ends up eating dirt, with Owens adjudicating that he was at fault (he was). 
		 Goode clears upfield to give his side a lineout with five minutes remaining. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:48PM BST 
		73 min: Racing 12 Saracens 15  
		Klemenczak carries hard and gets over the gainline but he, too knocks forward and Saracens survive.  
		 They are rewarded with another five-metre scrum. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:46PM BST 
		71 min: Racing 12 Saracens 15  
		Oh my-it really is game on. 
		 Racing pinch a lineout in their own half and they flick the switch. Imhoff swerves round Morris, and offloads delicately to a searing Vakatawa. 
		 France's centre carries into the Saracens 22 before he is brought down. Imhoff is there to carry again but there is a slight knock-on in the tackle and Saracens will have a five-metre scrum. 
		 A huuuuuge Racing shove ensues and Billy knocks on at the base. Racing scrum, five metres out. 
		 The next few minutes will define the match. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:42PM BST 
		PEN MACHENAUD: Racing 12 Saracens 15  
		And it is game on. Three points in it. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:41PM BST 
		68 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15  
		Racing look more composed and organised, and their forwards begin to carry aggressively. But big Billy Vunipola strips Oz in the tackle and Saracens win the turnover. 
		 The visitors do not protect the loose ball, however, and Ryan wins a penalty for holding on-Racing will almost definitely leave with something and it will be game on. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:39PM BST 
		66 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15  
		Barritt has to depart for a HIA as his side restart with a scrum. 
		 Zebo takes a Wigglesworth box-kick brilliantly-again-under bags of pressure. 
		 Rhodes is penalised for not rolling away from the Zebo tackle and Racing will have another go, from a lineout, down in Saracens' 22. You sense they need something from this foray into Saracens' territory-a penalty at the minimum. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:36PM BST 
		64 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15  
		Major concern for Saracens, here, as Barritt is down. 
		 Nigel Owens has just said he thinks the Saracens captain was knocked out. That would mean a HIA, at least, you'd expect. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:35PM BST 
		64 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15  
		Racing win a scrum penalty and after debating a disorganised attack, they decline the offer of advantage and kick to the corner. 
		 But it's fantastic Saracens defence once again, as Zebo, Vakatawa and Russell are not given an inch. Ryan knocks on as Russell throws an out-the-back offload, and Saracens will put into the scrum. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:31PM BST 
		61 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15  
		Maitland is penalised for not releasing the tackled player, allowing Russell to give Racing a lineout just outside the Saracens 22. They try some chicanery at the set-piece, but it doesn't work and replacement scrum-half Machenaud knocks on. 
		 There's a sense here that Racing are trying to run before learning to walk. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:27PM BST 
		59 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15  
		What a passage of play. 
		 Racing decide route one is the way to go, and they make good progress, with Thomas making a good break. 
		 But Vakatawa spills-with Saracens looking decidedly offside-and Daly hacks downfield. Only him and Lewington are chasing-and it seems more difficult not to score-but he elects to dive onto the ball instead of hack on, allowing Racing's defenders to get back and prevent the try. 
		 Goode is eventually penalised for side entry and Racing hang on. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:23PM BST 
		55 min: Racing 9 Saracens 15 
		Chat and Vakatawa throw the kitchen sink at Saracens' defence, but Itoje and Barritt stand firm to the challenge. Rhodes chops Oz and Saracens win the ball back-fantastic work. 
		 And Sarries burst! A delightful inside ball from Billy sends Morris streaking up the field. He gets to within 10 metres of the Racing line but Imhoff gets back to win a holding-on penalty and, you would have to say, save the match. 
		 If Saracens had scored a five-pointer there, Racing would surely have been toast. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:19PM BST 
		PEN GOODE: Racing 9 Saracens 15 
		Daylight for the first time, as Goode extends Saracens' second-half purple patch. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:18PM BST 
		52 min: Racing 9 Saracens 12  
		What a tackle from Morris-and what an escape from Racing. 
		 Goode kicks downfield and Russell gathers, and fires a long pass to Zebo. But Morris is onto him like an Exocet, flinging himself at the Racing full-back. Zebo knocks on inside his own 22, but no Saracens players can pick up the loose ball. 
		 The chance goes begging but they will, at least, put into a scrum deep into Racing territory. And they win a peanlty, as Racing replacement tighthead Oz collapses.  
		 26 Sep 2020-02:15PM BST 
		50 min: Racing 9 Saracens 12  
		Iribaren catches Goode in the air chasing a high ball, and Goode nudges the visitors into Racing territory, giving his side a lineout. 
		 But Barritt spills forward, and Thomas and Vakatawa look to exploit. The former kicks downfield, but Goode has read the danger and calls a mark. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:13PM BST 
		PEN GOODE: Racing 9 Saracens 12 
		What a start to the half for Saracens. Six points in seven minutes and they take the lead. 
		 Racing have started lackadaisically. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:11PM BST 
		45 min: Racing 9 Saracens 9 
		Saracens have come out with a bang after half-time. 
		 It's wondrous, harrying defence from the visitors, and they force Racing to knock-on just inside their half. 
		 The bad news continues for the home side, as they are penalised at the scrum. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:09PM BST 
		PEN GOODE: Racing 9 Saracens 9 
		A fantastic start to the half from Saracens. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:07PM BST 
		42 min: Racing 9 Saracens 6  
		A very punchy start from Saracens. 
		 They recover a Wigglesworth box kick and make their way to Racing's 22, with Daly and Morris both prominent. 
		 Claassen is penalised for a deliberate knock-on and Goode will have an easy shot to bring his side back level. 
		 26 Sep 2020-02:05PM BST 
		Second half 
		Back underway in Paris. As Saracens clear Russell's restart. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:56PM BST 
		To confirm 
		The half-time score is 9-6 to Racing. 
		 A truly bizarre end to the half-no one seemed to know what the score was! 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:54PM BST 
		The half's main talking point 
		Racing were pinged for not using the ball at the back of the ruck when asked to by referee Nigel Owens. Take a picture of it; tell the grandkids. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:52PM BST 
		Half-time: Racing 9 Saracens 6 
		A bit of a drab affair, in honesty. A draw would probably be the fair result at the minute, with neither team really doing enough to justify a lead. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:50PM BST 
		PEN IRIBAREN: Racing 9 Saracens 6  
		Immense confusion here. The flags have gone up, but no one seems to know whether the kick was successful or not. The in-house scoreboard stays at 6-6, but belatedly updates to 9-6. 
		 We shall update shortly! 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:48PM BST 
		39 min: Racing 6 Saracens 6  
		Gorgeous from Racing as they give themselves a chance to take the lead before half-time. 
		 Russell scoops up a Saracens kick in his own 22, but he steps to the left and finds Thomas in space. The Racing wing streaks down the sideline, chips in Saracens' 22 and Daly has no choice but to run it into touch. 
		 Saracens are pinged at the ensuing lineout, and Iribaren will have a simple chance to give Racing the lead at the break. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:45PM BST 
		36 min: Racing 6 Saracens 6  
		It is all a bit cagey. 
		 Russell hammers Goode with Saracens on the attack, before Saracens put the bomb up. Zebo takes it emphatically-leaping like a salmon, but Chat drops a simple pass from the next phase, and Saracens will put into another scrum on the Racing 22-metre line. 
		 But Mako is pinged at the scrum and Racing clear. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:42PM BST 
		34 min: Racing 6 Saracens 6  
		Mako, Rhodes, George, Maitland all carry with vigour for Saracens, before Wigglesworth tests Thomas with another box kick. 
		 He's not under much pressure, but he spills it forward-again. It could be a long afternoon for him. Saracens with another scrum inside the Racing 22. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:40PM BST 
		PEN IRIBAREN: Racing 6 Saracens 6 
		Iribaren makes no mistake, and we are back on equal terms in Paris. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:39PM BST 
		32 min: Racing 3 Saracens 6  
		But straight from the restart, Koch is penalised (harshly) for going off his feet at a ruck. 
		 Iribaren with an immediate opportunity to level the scores. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:38PM BST 
		PEN GOODE: Racing 3 Saracens 6 
		It's a nice strike from Goode, and the visitors take the lead for the first time. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:37PM BST 
		30 min: Racing 3 Saracens 3  
		Just as Saracens were looking dangerous, Iribaren intercepts a Wigglesworth pass and Racing ignite. Vakatawa feeds Thomas, who makes progress down the right, but Maitland works hard to track back and win a holding-on penalty. 
		 Goode will have a tricky shot at goal. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:35PM BST 
		28 min: Racing 3 Saracens 3  
		Rhodes mimics Stretch Armstrong to win a lineout for Saracens as they move into Racing's half. 
		 Daly slides a really awkward grubber through to Zebo in the Racing backfield, and it skips off the artificial turf forcing the Racing full-back to knock-on. Scrum Saracens, wide right, in the Racing 22. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:33PM BST 
		26 min: Racing 3 Saracens 3  
		A great high-ball take from Claasen on halfway gives Racing the chance to ask some questions of the visitors, but just as they are beginning to probe Barritt chops Ben Arous and Racing's athletic prop spills forward. Scrum to Saracens on halfway. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:31PM BST 
		PEN GOODE: Racing 3 Saracens 3 
		Easy as you like for Goode, and it is even stevens. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:31PM BST 
		23 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		Billy picks up from the base for Saracens but Lauret is penalised for not using his arms in the tackle. 
		 Goode will surely bring Saracens even; it is bang in front. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:30PM BST 
		22 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		Racing have been penalised by Nigel Owens for not using the ball quickly enough at the back of a ruck following their five-metre lineout-take a picture! 
		 What it means is that Saracens have a very dangerous five-metre attacking scrum. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:27PM BST 
		20 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		Saracens clear as Ben Arous is pinged for dragging down a maul. 
		 It is very, very good from Saracens. A pinpoint box-kick from Wigglesworth, that Thomas cannot take cleanly. Saracens come back up with the ball and Wigglesworth chips over into Racing's five-metre line, giving the home side the lineout. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:24PM BST 
		18 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		Racing test Saracens' defence in the midfield, as Russell almost puts Vakatawa clear. 
		 Racing's fly-half decides that pragmatism is best, however, nudging a grubber through into Saracens' 22, giving the visitors the lineout. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:22PM BST 
		16 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		Bird steals the lineout for Racing; sloppy from Saracens. 
		 But the visitors come back as Maitland regathers Russell's clearance. The Vunipolas combine majestically-offloading and carrying-to take Saracens back up into the Racing 22. 
		 But Iribaren pinches the ball back, and Saracens are penalised for an offside. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:20PM BST 
		14 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		It was a touch too far for Iribaren this time, pushing his attempt to the left of the posts. 
		 Russell puts the bomb up again, and Ryan thinks he's away as he collects the loose ball, but there was a knock-on from a team-mate as they contested for the ball in the air, so the lock is penalised and Saracens kick down to Racing's 22. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:18PM BST 
		12 min: Racing 3 Saracens 0  
		That is sublime work from Ryan for Racing.  
		 Saracens look to counter but Daly is caught on halfway. Ryan gets all over the ball like a cheap suit and he wins a holding-on penalty for his side. 
		 Iribaren, from further out than his last successful effort, will go for the sticks again. 
		 Meanwhile, Morris is on for Taylor for Saracens. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:16PM BST 
		PEN IRIBAREN: Racing 3 Saracens 0 
		It's a sweet strike, and Racing take the lead. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:15PM BST 
		10 min: Racing 0 Saracens 0  
		Imhoff spots space down the blindside as Racing go on the attack. 
		 The home side aren't able to surge through the gears, however, as Saracens are penalised for not rolling away. 
		 Iribaren will have a shot at goal from 43 metres. He doesn't miss many, remember. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:13PM BST 
		7 min: Racing 0 Saracens 0  
		Saracens look to counter through Maitland after they clear their lines. 
		 A fantastic hit on Mako from Lauret and Ryan causes the England prop to spill. Racing scrum just inside their own half. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:10PM BST 
		5 min: Racing 0 Saracens 0  
		Sanconnie does depart, replaced by Chouzenoux. 
		 Racing ignite a sweeping attack, Russell pulling the strings and stretching the Saracens defence. 
		 Vakatawa leaves Taylor for dead, before Russell puts up a high bomb into the Saracens 22. Maitland just about deals with it, tackling Zebo into touch who pounced on the loose ball, and Saracens will throw in inside their own 22. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:06PM BST 
		3 min: Racing 0 Saracens 0  
		Racing attack Saracens at the breakdown, disrupting the visitors' ball. Daly cuts a fantastic line off a cutting George pass to get Saracens back on the front foot, but the attack breaks down as the ball spills forward. 
		 Sanconnie has gone down very, very awkwardly from a head knock as he tried to tackle Goode. 
		 There could be a long pause here. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:03PM BST 
		2 min: Racing 0 Saracens 0 
		Saracens with an early attack following Russell's clearance and they start promisingly. Goode jinking, Maitland makes a half-break, and eventually Daly threads a kick through into touch behind Thomas, in the corner. 
		 Racing-and Russell-clear comfortably from the lineout, however. 
		 26 Sep 2020-01:01PM BST

		Alex Goode to get us underway.

		Mark McCall speaks pre-match 
		26 Sep 2020-12:39PM BST 
		Team news 
		Saracens are unchanged from that victory in Dublin but the big news, I guess, is that there is no Bernard Le Roux for Racing. The lock-cum-flanker must be injured, as he has been one of the world's best forwards in 2020. 
		 Le Roux's absence is such that, although Racing remain favourites, Saracens's task has become slightly easier. 
		 26 Sep 2020-12:23PM BST 
		Good afternoon 
		Hello and welcome to live coverage of the first of this afternoon's Champions Cup semi-finals, between Racing 92 and Saracens at <meronyme id="1646">the Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme>. 
		 Can Mark McCall's men do it again? With a last-place finish in the Premiership confirmed, their European crusade represents their last chance for glory. Their titanic victory against Leinster in Dublin was a supreme show of collective unity, with a game plan that was executed to pinpoint precision. But, as impressive as that Dublin victory was, there is a sense that today might be an even tougher challenge against these quickfiring Parisian aristocrats. 
		 Against Leinster, Saracens knew what to expect. They were coming up against a collective threat, grounded in slick organisation and accuracy. Racing, however, are not in that mould. The French league leaders possess threats everywhere: from the rollicking Camille Chat-is there a better hooker in world rugby at the minute?-to the quick-witted Finn Russell, the athletics Virimi Vakatawa and the fleet-footed Teddy Thomas. This team won comfortably against Clermont in Montferrand last weekend; not many teams do that. 
		 The nuts and bolts of Saracens game that went so well at the Aviva Stadium last weekend-scrummaging, breakdown aggression, and that phenomenal box-kick-and-chase game-will have to be flawless once again if they are to reach their fourth Heineken Cup final in five years with a win indoors in Paris. 
		 Racing's Irish lock Donnacha Ryan, meanwhile, was fully aware of the threat that Saracens pose when he spoke to Charlie Morgan earlier in the week. 
		 “They’re a very well organised, well coached team with a fantastic culture in the group that is plain for all to see,” Ryan said. 
		 “They got such a good start, made Leinster look really uncomfortable and were full value for their win. 
		 “The stadium was empty but, I have to say, it looked like they created their own atmosphere on the pitch, imposed their gameplan on Leinster and were able to get over the line.”

<titre>Russell's flash of genius signals end of an era for brave Saracens</titre>
<auteur>MICK CLEARY</auteur>
<texte>
		Racing 92 19  
		 Saracens 15  
		 Att: 1,000  
		 And so an era ends for Saracens, a time of notable glory but also of controversy, a stain forever etched on their reputations despite their typically lung-busting, gritty, defiant play at <meronyme id="1647">La Defense Arena</meronyme>, qualities that have brought them countless trophies but were not enough to deny Racing 92 a place in their third European final in five seasons.
		Saracens are consigned to be wanderers in the Covid-afflicted wasteland of professional rugby, already relegated and with little prospect of rugby in the Championship until well into next year. It is also adieu to Europe for two years for the three-time winners, maybe even longer. The drooped-head ranks of Saracens players made a forlorn sight at the final whistle. At least they went out on their shields in the Champions Cup and not damned by misdeed as they were in the Premiership. In that regard Sara cens were as Saracens have always been - gnarly, spirited and selfless. At least they perished in noble fashion. 
		 Fittingly, it took the miracle-worker that is Racing fly-half Finn Russell to help his side rise from the seeming dead when sparking the match-clinching try for Juan Imhoff just four minutes from time. Up to that moment it appeared as if Saracens' tight, restricted game had once again stifled the opposition with Racing trailing for much of the second half. It had been a crabby, fretful, errorstrewn game and Saracens made fit to do as they had done in Dublin seven days earlier and defy the odds to claim a surprise victory. 
		 But Russell has genius in his Scottish genes, a sense of adventure and possibility in every action, scanning for openings, alert to everything. 
		 Racing were badly in need of some Houdini activity and Russell provided it with a deft little chip over the onrushing defence, a pre-planned move that saw the ball drop into the hands (with a little heart-stopping fumble) of Virimi Vakatawa. The powerhouse centre was off and away, stepping and fending, finding Russell on the outside when finally felled, the ball swiftly shipped on to Imhoff for the try that ignited <mention id="1648">La Defense</mention> with 1,000 fans permitted. Sport rarely provides for sentimental send-offs and there was to be no onfield final whistle salutations for the man who has epitomised the selfless essence of Saracens over the past 12 years. Brad Barritt, the captain, was led groggily from the pitch in the 65th minute after getting smacked on the head by stray bodies piling into a ruck. Even the usually reliable Barritt was slightly off-key, spilling a ball in contact at one point, a flaw that captured the tone. 
		 Saracens have been on their relative uppers as regards depth of squad. 
		 Barritt was not the only casualty. The London club needed to keep a full complement on the field for as long as possible, so the sight of a stricken Duncan Taylor being forced off in the 13th min-ute with a shoulder problem following a collision with the huge slab that is Vakatawa would have caused furrowed brows in the ranks of Sarries supporters. Yet the Saracens mantra held good: one man falls, another steps forward. 
		 And former England Under-20 centre Dom Morris filled the breach admirably. Morris, an academy product, was true to all those deep-rooted virtues. It was he who spotted in the 51st minute that Racing were playing too fast and loose across their own 22 and nailed Simon Zebo with a ball-spilling tackle. From there, Saracens were to win their second scrum penalty within seven minutes, which Alex Goode duly converted to take his team clear at 15-9. There was even more invigorating stuff to come from Morris when he tore deep into Racing territory, striding strongly but running out of support. Moments later it was the turn of Alex Lewington to almost break the try deadlock.  
		 The Saracens wing, though, was not able to keep his balance when gathering, allowing the opposition defence to scramble back. These were the fleeting moments of opportunity for Saracens. They had taken their one gilt-edged opening against Leinster and it brought great dividends. There was to be no repeat. The scrum was once again prominent until the forward pack tired in the second half as Racing were able to replenish from the bench. 
		 The Vunipola brothers, Mako and Billy, combined to good effect at one juncture but there was little space, little fluency and few clear chances. 
		 It was left to the goal-kickers to take what was on offer, Goode knocking over a couple of first-half pots at goal only for Racing's Teddy Iribaren to trump him with three successful kicks to send his team into half-time with a narrow lead. 
		 That changed as Saracens managed to find momentum after the break. Racing, though, have been yearning for a European title. The Parisian high-rollers have recruited accordingly. Russell repaid on that investment with a piece of artistry that would not have been out of place in the Louvre. For Saracens, tomorrow is a long time hence.

		 * France joins Germany, Spain, Italy in easing lockdown 
		 * Non-essential shops, businesses allowed to reopen 
		 * Macron's government wary of second wave of infections
		* Tells carmakers aid depends on producing more in France (Adds color from Cannes in paragraphs 15-16) 
		 By Tangi Salaün and Richard Lough 
		 PARIS, May 11 (Reuters) - France tiptoed out of its strict coronavirus lockdown on Monday, allowing non-essential shops, factories and other businesses to reopen for the first time in eight weeks to help resuscitate the economy despite the risk of a second wave of infections. 
		 With the world's fifth highest official death toll, France is also reopening schools in phases and its 67 million people can now leave home without government paperwork, although documentation is still needed for rush-hour travel around Paris. 
		 Theaters, restaurants and bars will remain closed until at least June with authorities wary of the peril of new outbreaks emerging - highlighted by a scramble in South Korea to contain a cluster of cases linked to nightclubs. 
		 "Everyone's a little bit nervous. Wow! We don't know where we're headed but we're off," said Marc Mauny, a hair stylist who opened his salon in western France at the stroke of midnight. 
		 In Paris, boutiques on the Champs Elysees opened their doors to the public for the first time since March 17. In metro stations, staff handed out face-masks and sanitizer to commuters while stickers on train seats marked out social distancing. 
		 <mention id="1668">The capital's La Defense business district</mention> was largely deserted as most employees continued to work from home. 
		 Only 10-15% of staff were expected back in their glass towers, a number expected to rise to 25% in June and 70% by September, said Marie-Celie Guillaume, head of the state agency Paris La Defense which manages <mention id="1669">the district</mention>'s public spaces. 
		 "We're headed for a very slow, gradual return," she told Reuters. 
		 ONE OF EUROPE'S TOUGHEST LOCKDOWNS 
		 President Emmanuel Macron's government lifted one of Europe's toughest lockdowns after the rate of infection slowed and the number of patients in intensive care fell to less than half the peak seen in April. 
		 The virus has claimed 26,380 lives in France. 
		 Manufacturing plants can reopen providing they put safety measures in place, which for some means not running at full capacity. People can only travel up to 100 km (62 miles) unless for professional reasons, funerals or caring for the sick. 
		 Trade unions and opposition parties have underscored the risks that COVID-19 infections will pick up again, particularly in places where distancing is difficult such as schools. 
		 Health Minister Olivier Veran warned the government would reverse the relaxing of restrictions if infections spiked again. 
		 "If the virus were to resume its wild race, we would again impose lockdown measures," Veran told BFM television. 
		 BALANCING ACT 
		 In the Riviera resort of Cannes, whose now-postponed annual film festival had been due to start on Tuesday, police chased a dozen surfers out of the waves, but did not issue fines. Beaches remain off-limits along much of the Mediterranean coast. 
		 "(Being out on the water), that's the dream!" cried one surfer underneath the esplanade's palm trees. "It's almost worth the 135-euro fine," laughed another. 
		 Macron is eager to rescue an economy in freefall. The euro zone's second biggest economy is forecast to contract 8% this year, and joins countries globally scrambling to rebuild supply chains. 
		 Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Monday said French carmakers, hit hard by the coronavirus downturn, must bring more production back to France in exchange for government aid. 
		 His ministry is preparing sector-specific recovery plans for the struggling tourism, aerospace and auto industries. 
		 "We are ready to help you," Le Maire said on BFM Business radio. "In exchange it's going to be, what's your relocation plan?" 
		 To help workers return to their jobs, kindergarten and primary schools reopen this week, and junior high schools later in the month in areas where the infection rate is low. 
		 France is split into "green zones" where the infection rate is low and "red zones," including the greater Paris region, where the rate is higher and more restrictions remain in place. People across the country are advised to work from home if they can. 
		 The public health crisis will leave long-lasting marks in France. Long accustomed to being told their high taxes paid for the best healthcare in the world, the French have been dismayed by the rationing of critical drugs, face masks and equipment.

<titre>'Fearless' Russell has potential to punish England.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		ELLIOT Daly insists England will pay a high price if they lose concentration against Scotland ringmaster Finn Russell even for a moment of Saturday's Guinness Six Nations opener. 
		 Daly knows the "free and fearless" Russell has the range of attacking skills to orchestrate a first victory at Twickenham since 1983.
		Two years ago the Racing 92 maverick inspired a remarkable Scottish comeback when a 31-0 deficit ended in a 38-38 draw, the underdogs denied a famous win only by a stoppage-time try from George Ford. 
		 And more recently Daly was present for Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final defeat at <meronyme id="1670">Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> when Russell engineered the match-winning try with a trademark chip over the defensive line. 
		 "The way he plays is very free and fearless. You have to be ready for everything. He might do a few things that come off, but you have to stay in the moment and limit them," full-back Daly said. 
		 "I've played against him a few times now and you have to anticipate some stuff that you wouldn't anticipate from other players. It's understanding what he sees in the game and trying to work out what he'll do, although you can't get it right every time. With Saracens, we switched off a little bit and that was the game sorted. If you look back on that match, we could have stopped that if we were a bit more alert. 
		 "That was in the 70th minute, so it's about doing it for the full 80 and not switching off." 
		 England have turned to reality TV show 'Love Island' for inspiration as they look to forge social bonds when in camp at The Lensbury during the Six Nations. 
		 Among the tougher coronavirus safety protocols brought in to reduce the risk of an outbreak is a rule that players can only socialise outdoors, in areas that include heaters, a giant chess board and table tennis. 
		 "It's like Love Island without the weather! We've got the fire pit, so that's a tick," Daly said. 
		 "It's nice to have the option to do this, otherwise it would be very difficult to socialise as a group. 
		 "I know it's not the weather to socialise outdoors, but we've got heaters and open tents, so we're definitely able to sit with each other and have a coffee, which is more than we would have been able to. 
		 "The new restrictions are definitely different. We thought they were strict during the last campaign. Now it's gone to a different level. But it's what's needed to play at the weekend so we have to get on with it. It's nice to have that otherwise it would be train, lunch, dinner and then bed." 
		 England have received a lift ahead of the first instalment of their title defence with the news that respected defence coach John Mitchell has signed a contract extension taking him until the end of the 2023 World Cup. 
		 The former All Blacks boss joined Eddie Jones' management team in 2018 after Paul Gustard departed for Harlequins and his responsibilities also include overseeing development of the back row. 
		 "We have some unfinished business and a big goal of winning in 2023," said Mitchell in reference to England's 2019 World Cup final defeat.

<titre>Interview 'I ran for my life - I did not want to end up the victim of a gang war' Sport Rugby Union?Springbok star Cheslin Kolbe, who faces Exeter with Toulouse on Saturday, seeks to offer hope for youngsters in his hometown</titre>
<auteur>DANIEL GALLAN</auteur>
<texte>
		Cheslin Kolbe has been side stepping trouble all his life. His most famous shimmy was in Yokohama last year when he turned England's captain Owen Farrell into a Ferris wheel en route to a World Cup-clinching try for South Africa, but while the sporting stakes were perilously high that day, they were nothing compared to the afternoon in Cape Town, many years previously, when his jet heels may well have saved his life. Back then, Kolbe would spend most afternoons in a park which lay between his parents' and grand mother's houses in Scottsville, a small suburb of Kraaifontein on the northern edge of Cape Town.
		It was a haven for drug dealers and violent gang members, and Kolbe had grown used to wit nessing drug deals and minor scuffles. One Friday, at around 2pm, he sensed a shift in the atmosphere. Two rival gangs were squaring off in the middle of the park, attracting attention like a black hole. Something had to give. "They just started shooting each other," Kolbe says, still incredulous after all these years. "I ran for my life. I didn't want to be a victim of a gang war. I just started running." 
		 Kolbe's childhood was filled with such traumas. He describes seeing a man beaten with a spade and another getting stabbed, and still remembers the helpless feeling of being surrounded by three strangers as a knife was pressed into his stomach, scarcely comprehending the reality that his life hinged on him unclasping a bracelet in time before cold steel punctured his gut. 
		 "That was life in Scottsville," he explains. "It happened on a daily basis. Every day someone was killed or locked up." 
		 Most damaging of all was the drug trade. Many of Kolbe's close childhood friends were sucked into the vicious and predictable cycle of addiction - from youthful experimentation, to being cast out of home and into the waiting clutches of dealers who make them start selling themselves. From there it is a short journey to petty crime and, ultimately, more serious misde meanours. "I lost a lot of friends this way," Kolbe says. "They never appreciated the little they had. They took the easy way out. They would try and convince me to try it, but I always said, 'This is not me'. That was not how my parents raised me. They never tried alcohol or drugs so who am I to want to experience things like that? "I never once had a weekend where I was partying. I was in the gym or training since I can remember. Sport was definitely the way out for me." 
		 Kolbe has come a long way since those dangerous days in Scottsville - 7,500 miles, in fact, to Toulouse, for whom he turned in a matchwinning performance in last weekend's Champions Cup quarter-final against Ulster. Exeter await at Sandy Park on Saturday, and Rob Baxter must already be sleeping fitfully as he wrestles with the conundrum of how to stop him. 
		 Kolbe has worked tirelessly to develop his talent, but his genes have helped. His father Andrew was a talented inside centre during apartheid. Unable to break into the elite end of the sport in South Africa due to the colour of his skin, he had little choice but to pour his energy into shining for his local club Hands and Heart, which he did brilliantly. 
		 "I've heard so many people in the Western Cape tell me he was exceptional," Kolbe says. "He just never got the chance." 
		 While his friends had their heads turned by other distractions, the younger Kolbe would accompany his father to training sessions and weekend matches, busying himself with a ball on the touchline. It is not simply his father, either. Kolbe's cousin is the men's 400 metres world-record holder Wayde van Niekerk and the pair have been racing since their legs could carry them. "I believe I was faster than him when I was younger," says Kolbe, who earned South African colours as a hurdler at under-12 and under-13 level. 
		 He then grins and almost reluctantly adds: "To be honest, I'm not sure I actually ever beat him." 
		 In contrast to athletics, rugby in South Africa is still largely viewed as a bastion of white privilege. Though this mindset is slowly ebbing away thanks to the changing demographics of the national teams, it still holds true that a player's chances of reaching the top are bolstered if he attends an elite school. Kolbe earned a scholarship to Brackenfell High School, a mixed state school with annual fees of around £1,100, a pittance compared to the better resourced traditional sporting powerhouses. But Kolbe took heart from his school's Latin motto of altiora spero - hoping for higher things - and refused to accept the limitations others placed upon him, not least those who thought he was too small - at 5ft 7in - to thrive in South Africa's notoriously physical game. 
		 "I've always worked to prove people wrong," Kolbe explains. 
		 "Players, team-mates, coaches and fans have always told me I'm too small. That just made me work harder in the gym. I was in there every day after school." 
		 His hard work paid off and in 2009 he earned a call-up to the Western Province Under-16 side as a second-choice fly-half for the annual Grant Khomo interprovincial week. He was selected to start in the final against the more fancied Free State outfit, scoring 17 points, including a dropped goal and a try. 
		 This was the same year the British and Irish Lions were last in South Africa. Though he never watched a game live, Kolbe was transfixed with the mythology surrounding the tourists and the pageantry of their loyal supporters. 
		 Adrian Jacobs started the first two Tests for South Africa at outside centre. Like Kolbe, Jacobs had grown up on the unforgiving streets of Kraaifontein. "He was one of us and the first in our community to get that exposure," Kolbe says of a man who still represents Hands and Heart. "We've seen so much talent [wasted]. He created a lot of positivity." 
		 Then there was Jaque Fourie's try in the second Test. With South Africa four points adrift with seven minutes to go, the hulking back bulldozed over Ronan O'Gara and brushed off the tackle of Mike Phillips to dot down in the corner. Kolbe says that score, recognised as the best try of 2009, "topped everything" across a season that changed his outlook on the game. This was not merely a pastime inherited from his father. This was now a tangible career path. He made his senior Western Province debut in 2012 and then for the Stormers franchise a year later. His speed and agility made him a natural fit with the Sevens outfit, but once again his size proved to be a barrier for higher honours. In 2017, he signed for Toulouse. 
		 When Rassie Erasmus took over from Allister Coetzee as Springbok coach in early 2018, he did away with a selection policy of picking overseas-based players only if they had more than 30 caps. Players such as Willie le Roux (with Wasps) and Faf de Klerk (Sale) injected international experience by virtue of their time abroad. After running rings around would-be defenders in the Top 14, Kolbe was handed his national debut in Brisbane in Sep tember that year. 
		 Under the leadership of Erasmus and captain Siya Kolisi, the Springboks espoused an ethos that sought to contextualise rugby. "In South Africa, pressure is not having a job," Erasmus said after the victory in Yokohama. "Pressure is one of your close relatives being murdered." 
		 Kolbe has long understood this. 
		 In 2014, he set up the Be the Difference Foundation, a charity that helps impoverished neighbourhoods in the Western Cape. At the start of the coronavirus lockdown, he played an active role feeding 400 people a week. Now, they are serving as many as 1,700 hot meals to those in need. 
		 "I am so thankful with how blessed I am," Kolbe says. "Getting here wasn't easy, but I've never wanted anyone to feel sorry for me. I see kids as young as 12 selling drugs and committing crimes in Kraaifontein. It's 10 times worse than it was. That is why I give back. I tell those kids, 'I was the same as you'. Every time I step on the field, I'm representing them."

<titre>Exclusive interview 'Our pride, brotherhood and unity is unbroken' ?Captain Brad Barritt believes Saracens can follow up their stunning win over Leinster with a fresh shock against Racing 92</titre>
<auteur>GAVIN MAIRS</auteur>
<texte>
		Sometimes, the smallest detail makes the biggest impact. When Brad Barritt arrived in the England camp in 2012 to win the first of his 26 caps, he took a moment before his first media interview to shake the hand of every journalist present. 
		 It is more common practice nowadays, but back then, in the wake of England's controversy-laced 2011 World Cup campaign, the politeness of his greeting stood out.
		"Thank you, that is nice to hear it made an impact," he said. Eight years on and the restrictions of Covid-19 have temporarily put a pause to the handshake, but his impeccable manners remain undiminished. "It seemed a very normal thing for me. I remember being a junior in the Sharks set-up [in Durban] and it was very customary if you arrived at a weights session to go and say hello to every guy and you would shake their hand. It is probably just the way I was brought up, traditional values." 
		 Those values were instilled by his English parents, who moved from Zimbabwe to Durban in 1985, and his schooling in South Africa. 
		 "It is very easy to shape some one's opinion about you in terms of how you engage with them and how you show every respect," he added. "It is something I hugely value and it stuck with me that no matter what someone's title is and their role, I think you should try to treat them fairly and equally and with respect." 
		 And yet, eight years on, and it is Saracens who are seeking to win respect back for the club. Their remarkable run of success: three Champions Cup titles and four Premiership titles in the last five years; has been undermined and overshadowed by the controversy of their salary cap breaches. 
		 The club have paid a heavy price: as well as the relegation to the Championship and the £5.4million fine, 12 senior players have moved on, either permanently or on loan. And yet, significantly, Barritt, the club captain and one of the foundations upon which the team were constructed 12 years ago, stayed, signing a three-month extension to prolong his contract. 
		 That the 34 year-old, famed for putting his body on the line for his club - his numerous injuries have included a lacerated eyeball and four metal plates in his cheek and eye socket - was prepared to stand firm when the squad's tight bond was under its greatest duress has been key to their attempts to move on and rebuild their reputation. 
		 With nothing to play for in the Premiership for this season or next, it is in Europe that Saracens are desperate to fire a final shot for now, and prove as much to themselves as anyone else that they remain a champion side. 
		 It was a spirit that epitomised their stunning 25-17 victory over Leinster in Dublin last Saturday. 
		 Barritt cherished the performance as possibly the best he has been involved in, even more special to him as it extended his competitive career with the club for at least another week. While others such as Maro Itoje and Michael Rhodes stole the headlines, Barritt was again the midfield rock for Saracens, making seven carries for 24 metres and missing none of his 16 tackles. 
		 "We have had some fantastic memories and moments but given the context of what has happened to Saracens this year, and more recently with 12 senior players moving on and given how formidable Leinster are as a team, it must rank as one of our best - if not our best - victory against the odds," he said. 
		 "It spoke volumes of the togetherness, the culture, the pride and unity and brotherhood amongst our players. It is something we are immensely proud of." 
		 Was that bond not tested during the salary cap scandal? "The respect, friendship, the feeling among the players and the group has never changed," he insisted. "We all know what has gone into what has been achieved in the past. Nothing was handed to us and we worked hard. We have always looked at ourselves in the mirror and said, 'we left everything out there'. The Leinster game was just another opportunity to do that. Being able to put all the external factors to one side and commit to an 80-minute performance. 
		 "You have to have full faith and belief in what you have done. For me and my team-mates, we know [what a] challenge and an achievement what we did over that time was. And no one will take those memories away from us." 
		 There is a sense, too, that there is an extra motivation within the group to ensure Barritt and other long-standing servants such as Richard Wigglesworth, who will leave the club at the end of this season, exit with one more special memory. But the stakes have risen again, today, when they face a starstudded Racing 92 side at <meronyme id="1672">the La Defense Arena</meronyme> in Paris for a place in next month's final. 
		 Saracens have named an unchanged side, with Alex Goode once again at fly-half in place of the suspended Owen Farrell, but Barritt admits the challenge will be to summon up the same emotional energy that was expended in overcoming Leinster. Barritt is unflinching in his belief in the character of this Saracens side, even though they are now shorn of the impact off the bench of previous seasons. 
		 "The thing I will look back on and value the most is the journey at Saracens," he added. "I arrived in 2008 and it was an underperforming team who at the time were ninth in the league. I loved being part of the journey and story of how we built up our Premiership pedigree and then European pedigree. 
		 "In 2013 we had that double loss and for me the making of this team was probably that year, to lose two finals [Premiership and European Cup] in successive weeks. It was the emotional maturity, the relentlessness of the organisation and the players, how we stuck in there together and we are able to turn it around and be able to have success in later years. For a long time we were expected to win and it was strange going into the Leinster game [as underdogs]. We now are going to try to replicate that feeling and special attitude for this fixture." 
		 If they can, no one more than Barritt will have earned such a special send-off.

<titre>Champions Cup game zone</titre>
<auteur>CHARLES RICHARDSON</auteur>
<texte>
		Bristol v Clermont BT Sp 2, C4, Pool Two 1pm No team averaged more points per game in the Champions Cup last season than Clermont; and no team averaged more points per game in the Challenge Cup last season than Bristol, so expect a cracker. Loss of Fijian swashbuckler Semi Radradra, however, is a blow to Pat Lam's side. 
		 Dragons v Wasps BT Sp 2, Pool One 5.30pm Dragons' first taste of the Champions Cup in almost 10 years comes with last season's Premiership beaten finalists, who have tyro Alfie Barbeary (right) starting at No8. But Wasps' underwhelming form could inspire Dragons to end a 10-match Champions Cup losing streak.
		Edinburgh v La Rochelle BT Sp 2, Pool One 8pm La Rochelle have been setting the Top 14 alight this season and head into this European window as the league leaders. If they bring their league form to Europe, which is not often the case with Ronan O'Gara's side, then it could get messy for Edinburgh, who are languishing in the Pro14 doldrums. 
		 Racing 92 v Connacht BT Sp 3, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 3.15pm Last season's finalists are soaring in the Top 14 and welcome Connacht for the first time to <meronyme id="1673">the La Defense Arena</meronyme>. The west Ireland outfit are in the midst of a purple patch of sorts, winning three of their past five in the Pro14, but a visit here is a step up in class. 
		 Bath v Scarlets BT Sp 2, Ultim, Pool One 3.15pm Considering their impressive rearguard in the 2019-20 campaign, Bath's start to this season might have been better, but that could also be said of the Scarlets who, despite a narrow loss to Pro 14 high-fliers Ulster, have only won three of their seven games this season. 
		 Dragon v Wasps 
		 Lyon v Gloucester BT Sp 2, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 1pm Gloucester have lost their past four away Champions Cup matches and after an underwhelming start in the Premiership, in which they have lost two of their three matches, optimism will not be rife of defeating a Lyon side who have not lost since Sept 13 and will feature Mathieu Bastareaud at No 8. 
		 Munster v Harlequins BT Sp 2, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 5.30pm The Irish are rampant in the Pro14, with three of the four, Munster included, unbeaten. Harlequins, spearheaded by fly-half Marcus Smith (right), have looked sharp in the Premiership. Five of the seven meetings of these two have been decided by single-digit margin. 
		 Toulon v Sale BT Sp 3, Pool One 3.15pm In a week in which director of rugby Steve Diamond left the club, a trip to the Cote d'Azur could be an emphatic baptism of fire for his replacement, former attack coach Paul Deacon. The Sharks are far from full strength, too, whereas their opponents look formidable. 
		 Montpellier v Leinster BT Sp 3, Pool One 5.30pm This contest would ordinarily be seen as a stand-out fixture, but with Leinster obliterating all before them in the Pro 14, and Montpellier's woeful start to the season - winning just three of their last eight games - a comfortable away win looks to be on the cards. 
		 Exeter v Glasgow BT Sp 2, Ultim, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 3.15pm The reigning champions are unbeaten in their past six Champions Cup matches at Sandy Park and will be wanting to pick up where they left off in October. But the return of eight internationals to stuttering Glasgow, who have just one win in their last five in the Pro14, will toughen the Warriors.

<titre>City's proud past gives way to uncertainty FT Series London has long been a global hub for financial activity but Brexit and Covid are bringing significant change</titre>
<auteur>FT REPORTERS</auteur>
<texte>
		The FT is running a series examining the future of the City of London. Here we look back at how the UK capital established itself as an international financial centre and explore the geography and the business of the City. 
		 Cross-border banks As far back as 1980 banks operating out of the UK had cross-border exposures far greater than banks in Germany and France, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements. That speaks to the fact that big international banks use London for large syndicate loans that ultimately go to foreign clients. The City also attracts assets to support trading and liquidity management at banks that range from the UK's Barclays to big US investment banks such as Goldman Sachs.
		Markets such as Hong Kong, Germany and Ireland have seen exposures grow faster in the past 20 years but from a lower base. More recently, Brexit has prompted banks to shift assets to their new trading hubs in Frankfurt and Paris. 
		 Jobs British jobs have not always kept pace with the growth of the City. Official registers in the UK, Hong Kong and New York vary in the jobs they track. Oliver Wyman data for the UK show that between 100,000 and 105,000 people work in wholesale banking, a key City activity, while another 80,000 to 85,000 work in related industries including asset management, data providers and fintechs. The consultancy group's overall tally of wholesale banking and related industry jobs has gone down by about 5,000 since 2015. 
		 Trading volumes A historic strength of London has been its role as a hub for trading currencies and interest rate derivatives. Its location allows traders to catch the end of the Asian day and the opening on Wall Street. 
		 The good fortune of geography is underpinned by high-quality tech infrastructure. As a result, London accounts for 43 per cent of the turnover in the $6.6tn-a-day foreign exchange market and half of the daily $6.5tn traded in interest rate derivatives. 
		 Brexit has not dented the UK capital's dominance in these markets. London has stolen a march on rival financial centres to emerge as a base for dealing in currencies such as China's renminbi. 
		 Listings New York long ago eclipsed London as the dominant centre for taking companies public. This year companies listing on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange raised $150bn, dwarfing the $6bn or so raised in London. Mega US IPOs such as DoorDash and Airbnb, which raised a combined $6.2bn last week, have boosted the US IPO markets to record levels. 
		 With today's fast-growing companies tending to hail from Asia and the US, London is unlikely to again challenge for the lead. "There are complex considerations, including home country, target market and media/public perception, that impact where a firm chooses to go public," said Adam Markson, head of UK capital markets at Accenture. He added that the UK government's vow to review listings requirements could enhance London's position. 
		 Asset management Portfolio managers in London oversee around £8.5tn in assets for savers in funds and mandates — equivalent to more than 400 per cent of GDP, according to the Investment Association. This makes the UK the primary investment management centre in Europe and the second-largest globally after the US. 
		 Assets under management have almost tripled since 2009. Stockpickers have flocked to the UK thanks to its sophisticated ecosystem of brokers, sellside analysts and lawyers, and ready access to liquid markets. 
		 This has helped London to expand its market share at the expense of countries including France and Germany, where assets under management have fallen since the crisis, according to the European Fund and Asset Management Association. The UK's rise as an investment hub has been enabled by so-called delegation rights, which allow EU funds to be managed from other countries. This feature will remain in place after Brexit, barring any future attempts by European policymakers to limit it. 
		 Real estate vacancies Vacancy rates have risen since the Brexit vote. About 6 per cent of the commercial real estate stock in the City — home to banks, insurers and asset managers — is empty, according to Colliers International. That compares with 3.81 per cent at the end of 2016. By contrast, vacancy rates in <mention id="1674">La Défense</mention> in Paris have fallen more than 20 per cent. Rent remains resilient, however. 
		 The West End still commands £120 per sq ft a year for commercial space, just as it did at the end of 2016. Rates in the City have even crept higher, to £72.50 per sq ft a year. 
		 Will workers return after the virus? The Covid-19 pandemic prompted a sharp drop in virtually all types of activity in London, as office workers, shoppers and tourists stayed at home. 
		 Nine months on, the recovery has been muted. Businesses in the City, an area dominated by offices with relatively few residents, are vulnerable. Those include around 1,150 shops, 300 restaurants and 247 bars and pubs, according to estimates from the City of London Planning Department. Weeks after City offices had begun to reopen in September, London went into a second lockdown, emptying them out again. 
		 Even when the pandemic subsides, the City's woes will not be over. Some businesses will never reopen. Meanwhile, senior finance executives are rethinking how many people they need in their major offices after a prolonged period of working from home. Work could be done remotely full time, or moved to cheaper locations. This realisation could cost London's financial services industry more jobs than Brexit.

		 There is a sense, too, that there is an extra motivation within the group to ensure Barritt and other long-standing servants such as Richard Wigglesworth, who will leave the club at the end of this season, exit with one more special memory. But the stakes have risen again, today, when they face a starstudded Racing 92 side at <meronyme id="1675">the La Defense Arena</meronyme> in Paris for a place in next month's final. 
		 Saracens have named an unchanged side, with Alex Goode once again at fly-half in place of the suspended Owen Farrell, but Barritt admits the challenge will be to summon up the same emotional energy that was expended in overcoming Leinster. Barritt is unflinching in his belief in the character of this Saracens side, even though they are now shorn of the impact off the bench of previous seasons. 
		 "The thing I will look back on and value the most is the journey at Saracens," he added. "I arrived in 2008 and it was an underperforming team who at the time were ninth in the league. I loved being part of the journey and story of how we built up our Premiership pedigree and then European pedigree. 
		 "In 2013 we had that double loss and for me the making of this team was probably that year, to lose two finals [Premiership and European Cup] in successive weeks. It was the emotional maturity, the relentlessness of the organisation and the players, how we stuck in there together and we are able to turn it around and be able to have success in later years. For a long time we were expected to win and it was strange going into the Leinster game [as underdogs]. We now are going to try to replicate that feeling and special attitude for this fixture." 
		 If they can, no one more than Barritt will have earned such a special send-off.

<titre>Saracens are made for the big occasions ... we're all ready</titre>
<auteur>WILL MACPHERSON</auteur>
<texte>
		EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW ALEX LEWINGTON RACING 92 v SARACENS (European Champions Cup semi-final, tomorrow, 1pm, Channel 4 &amp; BT Sport) IN THE wake of that hugely popular Netflix documentary, the narrative around Saracens' Heineken Champions Cup defence, their tilt at a fourth European title in five years, is that it is the Last Dance. That when it ends, whatever the outcome, so does an era. 
		 As they prepare to take on Racing 92 in Paris tomorrow, this is a theory Saracens reject. Yes, they have lost players already (many only on loan, though) and are desperate to send Brad Barritt and Richard Wigglesworth out on a high — but the motivation is not that it is the end of anything.
		"I wouldn't say it's the last dance," says wing Alex Lewington (above), one of those staying. "The vast majority of the squad that is here now is the squad for next season. We have a couple of key characters leaving, but [with] the amount of talent coming through at Saracens it's always an evolving team. 
		 "Brad or Wiggs will leave a big hole but they know more than anyone that any player is replaceable and the club will move on. We are going to the Championship for what we hope is one year, but once we are back up I believe we will be challenging for trophies." 
		 Lewington says Saracens take greater motivation from the fear of not knowing where their next meaningful game is coming from. 
		 From their relegation earlier this year, they always had Leinster to concentrate on, and they ended up putting in one of the great European performances. Now they have Racing. Lose, and it is a couple of meaningless Premiership matches, then a Championship campaign with an unknown start date. Win, and a final against Exeter or Toulouse awaits next month. 
		 "That's where a lot of motivation comes from," says Lewington. "At the moment we are operating week to week on really important games, and the only things that dictates if there will be another is our performance." 
		 Saracens have had to reset this week after pulling off a performance that few outside the camp thought them capable of. It was a performance so epic that it provided evidence that their special decade was down to more than just money. Now, the challenge is to prove that Leinster was not their final. 
		 They have had the luxury of naming an unchanged 23 and we can expect their big names to have to play close to 80 minutes once more. 
		 One advantage for Saracens is that this brilliant Racing side are no mystery to them. To make it this far in the competition, they have already had to beat them. Racing's <meronyme id="1676">Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme>, which Lewington describes as "incredible, like playing a rugby match in the O2 Arena", is no mystery either. They know that they must hit new heights once more, but Lewington is confident that is possible. 
		 "One hundred per cent we can go up another level," he said. "We are prepared for occasions like this. We have enough players that have done it enough times that there's a belief running through the squad." 
		 SARACENS: Daly; Lewington, Taylor, Barritt, Maitland; Goode, Wigglesworth; M Vunipola, George, Koch; Itoje, Swinson, Rhodes, Wray; B Vunipola. Reps: Woolstencroft, Barrington, Clarey, Hunter-Hill, Clark, Davies, M Vunipola, Morris. 
		 KEY CLASHES Simon Zebo v Elliot Daly Two quality, versatile international backs. Both teams will be acutely aware that loose kicking opens up a threat from the backfield. Saracens were brilliant in the air against Leinster last week, while Daly's boot is always dangerous. 
		 Finn Russell v Alex Goode got the better of Johnny Sexton in Dublin, but Russell poses a completely different challenge. With the Scot about, there is always an element of chaos — and Racing thrive on that. 
		 Camille Chat v Jamie George was the picture of passion in his superb 80-minute shift last week. Chat, an extraordinarily-shaped Frenchman, also had an outstanding game as Racing beat Clermont. This promises to be a tone-setting battle.

<auteur>BEN COLES</auteur>
<texte>
		In the end, after a crushing late loss in Paris, Saracens hooker Jamie George could only give Racing 92 credit for producing a superb match-winning try, as three-time champions Saracens missed out on another European final. 
		 Juan Imhoff 's try, the only one of the match, meant that all of Saracens' dogged work in the second half to take charge of affairs in <meronyme id="1677">La Defense Arena</meronyme> were for nothing.
		"It was a great try, you almost have to applaud it," George admitted. "That's why it's more frustrating for us, because we maybe could have defended it slightly differently from a technical standpoint. But the way we fought and scrapped in that game, they needed to pull out something pretty miraculous to score. They did that, so fair play to them. When you have special players like that, they can always produce magic like they did. It was a special try to get them through to the final." 
		 Saracens had done their homework on the strong midfield relationship between Scotland fly-half Finn Russell and the France centre Virimi Vakatawa but the execution from Russell, cracking Saracens' defence open with a chip over the top, was immaculate. 
		 "They had a moment of magic in them," admitted Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. "Finn Russell has a great relationship with the 13. We practised for that all week but it came late in the game when we were tired. 
		 "I'm incredibly proud. To back up last week with a performance like that, after losing Duncan [Taylor] so early." 
		 Taylor's departure inside the opening quarter was an early setback that Saracens coped with admirably, as Dom Morris produced a stellar performance at outside centre, notably harassing Racing full-back Simon Zebo into a mistake under a high ball. "We've got a very resilient group and they fought on regardless," McCall said. "Dom Morris was brilliant. He defended superbly and attacked well. A superb experience for him and Manu Vunipola. There was a lot of courage." 
		 Racing, with their intergalactic stadium and back line conducted by Russell, are built to entertain. Yet in the first half they practically paid homage to Saracens, building a 9-6 lead through a highly-contested kick chase, smart tactical kicks, defensive pressure and building the scoreboard. Saracens' second-half surge nearly wrecked Racing's hopes in Europe once more, before Russell turned on the magic. His team-mate Donnacha Ryan, the former Ireland lock, was understandably full of praise. 
		 "He's a special player all right," Ryan said. "He makes a huge effort to speak French - although it gets better after a few beers! He comes across very laissez faire but he does a lot of video during the week and gets mistakes out of his head straight away. 
		 "He makes the guys around him look better and you couldn't ask more from a 10. He's world class and it's very hard to overlook him for any Scotland team or Lions tour." 
		 Racing will now seek to win the Champions Cup final at the third time of asking, after defeats by Saracens and Leinster in 2016 and 2018. The future for Saracens is less clear, but McCall looked at the performances of Morris and Manu Vunipola among others as a positive sign for the future. 
		 "In many ways it is the end of an era," McCall noted. "We're going to go on a new journey and one of the things today is we showed the qualities and characteristics we need for the foundations on the new journey. If we can keep those characteristics we showed today then I think we'll be OK." 
		 'It is the end of an era. We're going on a new journey and we showed the qualities we will need'

<titre>Ryan puts Racing on alert over rivals with 'big point to prove'</titre>
<auteur>CHARLIE MORGAN</auteur>
<texte>
		The Champions Cup quarter-final victory of Saracens over Leinster may have upset the odds, but it did not surprise Racing 92 lock Donnacha Ryan in the slightest. 
		 The 47-cap Ireland international started both games against Mark McCall's side during the pool stage of the European campaign. As recently as January, Ryan witnessed a similarly stirring performance from the champions at first hand.
		That day, less than 24 hours after their relegation from the Premiership was confirmed, Saracens faced Racing at Allianz Park. In a fraught first half, they lost Will Skelton to a red card and Billy Vunipola to a broken arm. And yet the Champions Cup holders pulled through, winning 27-24 to keep alive their title defence. "They're a very wellorganised, well-coached team with a fantastic culture in the group that is plain for all to see," Ryan said. "They got such a good start, made Leinster look really uncomfortable and were full value for their win." 
		 Ryan expects another ferocious tie at <meronyme id="1679">the futuristic Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme>. The indoor venue's lighting and big screens create an atmosphere akin to a nightclub, with a synthetic surface encouraging fastpaced, absorbing contests. 
		 Ryan added: "They're champions many times already, so they'll be able to manage the expectations and they've got a lot of ambition as well and have a big point to prove, especially with a lot of guys finishing up. "They'll be mad keen to give them the best send-off they can. 
		 Racing, Champions Cup runnersup to Saracens in 2016 and Leinster in 2018, delivered an authoritative quarter-final away win of their own, ousting Clermont 36-27, but are without Kurtley Beale after the new recruit failed to have a three-week ban for a high tackle against Montpellier overturned on appeal. Among a series of fascinating head-to-head tussles, fly-halves Alex Goode and Finn Russell lock horns. Ryan described the former as "underrated" and saluted Goode's "fantastic game appreciation" while acknowledging that Racing's defence will need to be "airtight". 
		 Russell's trademark array of fizzing spin passes, flicks and chips have accompanied his return to action and Ryan suggested the race for a ticket to South Africa with the British and Irish Lions next summer could be spurring the Scotsman.

<titre>Cordero capitalises on freak bounce to crush Saints hopes</titre>
<auteur>CHARLES RICHARDSON</auteur>
<texte>
		Northampton 12 Bordeaux Begles 16 Att: 1,841 
		 The manner in which Bordeaux grabbed this Champions Cup victory will cut Northampton deep. What will cut even deeper is that this was the perfect chance to win for the first time since August, but Again they could not finish the job. 
		 Northampton never went behind until the moments when it mattered most - the finale. The game was decided on a moment of freak opportunism from Argentina wing Santiago Cordero. Matthieu Jalibert, the fly-half who tormented England last Sunday, hit the post with a late penalty and Cordero reacted quickest to the vicious bounce. He dived over to condemn Saints to their 11th straight defeat in a game notable for its indiscipline.
		Northampton have a decent record against French sides at home and a confident start certainly suggested that this was going to be their evening. Courtney Lawes did some characteristic charging about on his return from injury, while the outstanding David Ribbans at lock brought niggle and edge. 
		 After good build-up play, with full-back George Furbank and returning fly-half Dan Biggar fizzing the ball into space, Northampton earned a 6-0 lead, courtesy of the boot of the Wales No10, and were cruising. 
		 Meanwhile, Bordeaux struggled to show even a glimpse of the form that saw them command the summit of the Top 14 table when the French top flight was abandoned in June. 
		 But this side were always going to grow into what had become a turgid affair and, when Northampton flew off their feet at a ruck in front of the posts, Ben Botica, the former Harlequins fly-half, had a simple chance to cut the deficit to three. He obliged, putting an earlier miss behind him. 
		 Thierry Paiva, the Bordeaux prop, was penalised several times in the first half and, following one of his indiscretions, Biggar restored Northampton's lead to six points. 
		 They should also have capitalised on a vibrant burst from No8 Shaun Adendorff but, when the ball was recycled, some desperate defending just about ensured that Taqele Naiyaravoro's offload could not find the outstretched arms of Furbank. 
		 There was always a sense that Saints might live to regret not taking their early opportunities. That sense was heightened after Cordero waltzed around Lawes but his attempted offload could not locate his captain, flanker Mahamadou Diaby, who would have cantered under the sticks. However, Botica's two further penalties did tie up the scores at 9-9. 
		 Northampton started the second half as they did the first but, as tensions remained hot-wired - with Lawes never far from the action - the referee's patience began to match. Flanker Cameron Woki was sent to the sin-bin for deliberately collapsing a maul that had started to shift, and Biggar restored the lead. 
		 It was not long before the yellow card was issued again. Maxime Lucu, Bordeaux's Basque scrumhalf, was dismissed for 10 minutes after stamping on Lawes's arm. 
		 The scrum was proving to be a major inconvenience for Northampton and it was from the set-piece that the game's defining moment came. After that most pernicious of bounces, Cordero scampered over and Saints will realistically have to beat Leinster in Dublin next week to give their European hopes alive. Details: Page 20 
		 Champions Cup game zone By Charles Richardson 
		 Bristol v Clermont BT Sp 2, C4, Pool Two 1pm No team averaged more points per game in the Champions Cup last season than Clermont; and no team averaged more points per game in the Challenge Cup last season than Bristol, so expect a cracker. Loss of Fijian swashbuckler Semi Radradra, however, is a blow to Pat Lam's side. 
		 Dragons v Wasps BT Sp 2, Pool One 5.30pm Dragons' first taste of the Champions Cup in almost 10 years comes with last season's Premiership beaten finalists, who have tyro Alfie Barbeary (right) starting at No8. But Wasps' underwhelming form could inspire Dragons to end a 10-match Champions Cup losing streak. 
		 Edinburgh v La Rochelle BT Sp 2, Pool One 8pm La Rochelle have been setting the Top 14 alight this season and head into this European window as the league leaders. If they bring their league form to Europe, which is not often the case with Ronan O'Gara's side, then it could get messy for Edinburgh, who are languishing in the Pro14 doldrums. 
		 Racing 92 v Connacht BT Sp 3, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 3.15pm Last season's finalists are soaring in the Top 14 and welcome Connacht for the first time to <meronyme id="1681">the La Defense Arena</meronyme>. The west Ireland outfit are in the midst of a purple patch of sorts, winning three of their past five in the Pro14, but a visit here is a step up in class. 
		 Bath v Scarlets BT Sp 2, Ultim, Pool One 3.15pm Considering their impressive rearguard in the 2019-20 campaign, Bath's start to this season might have been better, but that could also be said of the Scarlets who, despite a narrow loss to Pro 14 high-fliers Ulster, have only won three of their seven games this season. 
		 Dragon v Wasps 
		 Lyon v Gloucester BT Sp 2, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 1pm Gloucester have lost their past four away Champions Cup matches and after an underwhelming start in the Premiership, in which they have lost two of their three matches, optimism will not be rife of defeating a Lyon side who have not lost since Sept 13 and will feature Mathieu Bastareaud at No 8. 
		 Munster v Harlequins BT Sp 2, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 5.30pm The Irish are rampant in the Pro14, with three of the four, Munster included, unbeaten. Harlequins, spearheaded by fly-half Marcus Smith (right), have looked sharp in the Premiership. Five of the seven meetings of these two have been decided by single-digit margin. 
		 Toulon v Sale BT Sp 3, Pool One 3.15pm In a week in which director of rugby Steve Diamond left the club, a trip to the Cote d'Azur could be an emphatic baptism of fire for his replacement, former attack coach Paul Deacon. The Sharks are far from full strength, too, whereas their opponents look formidable. 
		 Montpellier v Leinster BT Sp 3, Pool One 5.30pm This contest would ordinarily be seen as a stand-out fixture, but with Leinster obliterating all before them in the Pro 14, and Montpellier's woeful start to the season - winning just three of their last eight games - a comfortable away win looks to be on the cards. 
		 Exeter v Glasgow BT Sp 2, Ultim, Pool Two 
		 Tomorrow 3.15pm The reigning champions are unbeaten in their past six Champions Cup matches at Sandy Park and will be wanting to pick up where they left off in October. But the return of eight internationals to stuttering Glasgow, who have just one win in their last five in the Pro14, will toughen the Warriors.

<titre>Fairer funding models sought in attempt to keep rail costs on track Transport Long-term value of big-ticket projects is being questioned, writes Patrick Mulholland</titre>
<auteur>PATRICK MULHOLLAND</auteur>
<texte>
		For two years of her undergraduate studies, Alice Best commuted to Sciences Po in Paris from her hometown of Chaville, near Versailles. The 15km trip took an hour by public transport, sometimes longer. "In the evening, if I missed the train because my class over-ran, I had to wait 30 minutes to catch the next one," she says. This was the first leg of a journey involving the Métro, the RER suburban railway and sometimes bus. 
		 Last year, Ms Best moved to the centre of Paris to be closer to work. However, plans are in place to improve public transport for Parisian commuters who are not so well located. Due to be completed in 2035, the Grand Paris Express is an ambitious rail project to improve connectivity. "The Big Eight", as Parisians call it, will loop across the French capital and sew together the banlieues, including neglected areas such as Saint-Denis and Clichy-sous-Bois in the north and east, to business districts such as <mention id="1684">La Défense in the west</mention>.
		Such grand plans are not cheap. Between 2013 and 2018, the estimated cost has jumped €12bn to €38.5bn, according to Reuters. But new transit infrastructure can have transformative economic and social effects on a city, says Jean-Louis Missika, deputy mayor of Paris. "You need to measure [its] impact ... over a very long period of time to realise it is worth it," he says. 
		 Paris is not alone. Cities around the world are assessing the value of costly infrastructure projects and seeking fairer ways of funding them. Last year, the UK parliament's public accounts committee lambasted Crossrail, a commuter rail project in London, for an "unacceptably laissez-faire attitude to costs" after delays added £2.8bn to the £14.8bn construction bill. 
		 These projects are necessary, says Alex Williams, director of city planning at Transport for London (TfL), the capital's transport authority, as there is a limit to how much can be done with "sweating existing assets" and "improving signalling". What is needed is additional rail capacity, and Crossrail will boost London's rail capacity 10 per cent. 
		 New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority says that developments on the Long Island Railroad Main Line and East Side Access to Grand Central Terminal will add 45 per cent capacity. Meanwhile, four new stations in the Bronx and the Moynihan Terminal at Penn Station will link neighbourhoods such as Co-op City to Manhattan. 
		 The value of increased rail capacity in growing cities is the creation of so-called agglomeration economies: areas of concentrated economic activity where businesses are at their most productive, says Simon Jeffrey from the think-tank Centre for Cities. It is this phenomenon that generates healthy tax receipts for local and national governments. 
		 In China, where 3,000km of subway line is under construction and will be operational within the next five years, each kilometre translates to 58 jobs and a rise in house prices, says Mao Baohua, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University. 
		 These statistics primarily refer to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, where land resources are scarce and commuter demand is high. "Some prefecture-level cities in the central and western regions, such as Baotou, Datong and Hengyang have yet to meet these conditions," says Prof Mao, "and therefore, they need to be cautious when it comes to building subway systems". 
		 Although high-density cities stand to benefit the most from new transit infrastructure, they are also more expensive and politically contentious to build in. 
		 The climbing value of property prices in proportion to their proximity to public transport is one aspect from which policymakers are looking to finance projects. Past extensions to London's Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway "produced significant land value uplifts", according to a study by KPMG and Savills, the estate agent. These projects have mostly been funded by government, prompting TfL's Mr Williams and others to call for landowners — who benefit from these investments — to shoulder more of their cost. 
		 For example, the $700m Northern Line extension to Battersea will be paid for through a 25-year enterprise zone centred on the Battersea Power Station, where rent payments will go towards defraying construction costs. 
		 "Crossrail was a cocktail of funding from government, borrowing and business," says Mr Williams. "From now on, every major project we do will require a similar model to get them over the line." 
		 Other methods include the Hong Kong "rail-plus-property" model that gives development rights to the MTR transit system, which profit-shares or retains partial ownership of any new adjacent property schemes. 
		 In New York City, the first phase of Hudson Yards, a private property development built over the MTA's train yard, opened near the extended No 7 subway line service to 34th Street last year. The project cost $2.4bn, but the transit authority has clawed back $1bn from completed transactions on some of the 60m square feet of office space and residential development. 
		 For Ms Best, better public transport is an incentive to move further out of Paris. "When I have children, maybe I will move back to the suburbs," she says. "One of my criteria is having reliable access to the city. Maybe in the future [the Grand Paris Express] will make it easier for me to do that."

		It is a sentiment that you might find somewhere in the middle of a rack of greeting cards, or halfway through an overly mawkish romantic comedy, where the protagonist spills their woes to their friend over a coffee they never seem to drink - but absence really does make the heart grow fonder. We know this, because here we are in the midst of another Covid lockdown, travel is still offthe agenda - and a holiday has never seemed more alluring. 
		 In such a context, the urge to daydream can be irresistible. Not about 
		 the unsuitable boyfriend who walked out in the first scene - but about fantasy destinations on distant shores. It is a time for tallying up the amazing locations we have yet to visit, and the places we would like to see when the situation is more amenable. You might, if you so choose, refer to this as a "bucket list".
		You might simply call it a determination to make the most of your restored freedoms when you can easily board an aircraft again. Either way, now is the hour for thinking "it really is time I booked that grand getaway to Peru". 
		 Peru would be an excellent start. The first part of this special feature is a 20-strong collection of the countries, cities and sites that everyone should have as holiday ambitions over the course of a lifetime. And that definitely means Machu Picchu. 
		 While we're at it, it should also mean Rio de Janeiro, the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal. These are not the niche options for globe-trotting - the hidden corners and the discreet discoveries. These are the greatest hits of travel - the play-it-to-the-back-of-the-stadium 
		 anthems, with lighters aloft. But then, we don't all like big choruses and mass singalongs. So this special also includes 20 less obvious ideas, from sailing the Silk Route to island-hopping in Taiwan. 
		 It also highlights 10 of the world's greatest hotels. And if the very concept of a "bucket list" sounds expensive, 
		 there are 10 further suggestions, for brilliant budget breaks. Daydreaming is fine, but there is no substitute for the real thing 
		 NEW YORK Why The Big Apple is an encapsulation of the thrilling urban America you have seen in endless films, and heard in the music of everyone from Charlie Parker to Debbie Harry. It keeps its side of the bargain in real life, in the cafés of Greenwich Village, the bars of <mention id="1685">the Meatpacking District</mention>, the paths of Central Park, and the shops gleaming on Fifth Avenue. Telegraph Travel tip "The Whitney is one of the most overlooked of New York's art galleries. Time your visit for rooftop sunset views of Manhattan." (New York city guide: telegraph.co.uk/ tt-new-york-tips). 
		 Perfect package A seven-night stay at the five-star NoMo SoHo, flying from Gatwick on July 3, costs from £769 per person through British Airways (0344 493 0787; ba.com/holidays). 
		 2 
		 THE GRAND CANYON Why With the possible exception of Monument Valley, no location captures the majesty of the American West like this vast scar in Arizona's soil; 277 miles of exposed geology where the river Colorado has cut a relentless path through granite, gneiss and sandstone. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "Visit the Desert View Watchtower at the east edge, built by architect Mary Colter in 1932. Like climbing a four-storey dream." (Trips of a Lifetime: telegraph.co.uk/tt-canyon-trip) 
		 Perfect package America As You Like It (020 8742 8299; americaasyoulikeit. com) offers Bright Lights, National Parks and Deserts - a 16-day journey through California, Nevada and Arizona that spends two nights on the Canyon's lip - from £1,085 per person, with flights. 
		 3 
		 THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS Why Remnants of the ancient era are still strewn across Europe and the Middle East - but few sites have the unfailing magnificence of Giza's royal tombs. The Great Pyramid was one of the initial Seven Wonders of the World. It is no less glorious five millennia on. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "Consider a visit in the evening. There are regular Son et Lumière shows that display the Pyramids in bursts of light". (Dream trips: The Pyramids: telegraph.co.uk/ttgreat-pyramids) Perfect package The Pyramids are part of the 11-day Highlights of Egypt break offered by Steppes Travel (01285 880980; steppestravel.com) from £3,500 per person, including flights. 
		 4 
		 THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA Why China is colossal; a country whose many regions could consume a decade of holidays. Its Great Wall is also colossal - 13,171 miles of masonry that epitomise both the hard gaze and epic history of the globe's new superpower, all within day-trip range of Beijing. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "It is well worth considering the Jinshanling and Simatai sections together, because you can hike the 6.2 miles from one section to the other, and have a taxi or bus collect you. The wall is steep in some parts, and hiking can be hot work, but after the first mile you will be away from other tourists." (Trips of a Lifetime: telegraph. co.uk/tt-Great-Wall-of-China) Perfect package Transindus (020 8566 3739; transindus.co.uk) offers a 15-day Essential China itinerary which pays its respects at Jinshanling, from £3,675 per person with flights. 
		 5 
		 ST PETERSBURG Why Like China, Russia is an enormity - a country that is all but a continent in its arc from Baltic to Pacific. St Petersburg is but a fragment of a 6.6 million-square-mile whole. But it is the best of it, compressing a nation's icy grandeur into one kernel of cathedrals and ballet stages, where the ghosts of the Tsars waltz past the paintings in the Hermitage. Telegraph Travel tip "There is no way of seeing all the Hermitage in one visit. The best approach is to research and seek out specific rooms or artworks." (An Insider Guide: telegraph. co.uk/tt-st-petersburg)

		 PARIS Why Europe has many great cities, but none has the chic pizzazz of Paris. It is all there in the elegance of the "Axe Historique" - the modernity of <mention id="1686">La Défense</mention> at one end, the Louvre's art at the other, the retail valhalla of the Champs Elysées in between. Telegraph Travel tip "Visit the Musée d'Orsay, not only for its impressionist masterpieces, but for the architectural backdrop of this former Belle Epoque railway station."

		 7 
		 THE TAJ MAHAL Why In a world where so many monuments were constructed to salute military victory or defend against it, Agra's soft-domed delight was built for love; not a temple or palace, but 
		 a mausoleum, hewn by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Telegraph Travel tip "To see the Taj Mahal with the fewest people, be at the West or East Gate at 6.30am in winter - half an hour before they open."

From £4,060 per person, with flights. 
		 9 PETRA Why The Middle East is full of historical treasures, some more accessible than others in this fractious era. But even in a becalmed world, Jordan's Nabataean city would stand out - concealed in its rock maze, its Treasury (Al-Khazneh) a miracle of the first century AD. Telegraph Travel tip "Explore. Most tourists are content with a snap of Al-Khazneh, but the site is a huge area of amphitheatres, cave houses and tombs."

From £3,195 per person, including flights. 
		 10 
		 THE SERENGETI Why You do not have to look hard for safari zones in Africa, but the Serengeti plains, splayed across the northern reaches of Tanzania, will meet every wildlife daydream - not least in the wildebeest "Great Migration" seasons of July-August and December-January. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "The Serengeti's best game-viewing areas are the shortgrass plains and their granite kopjes in the south, the Seronera Valley, the Western Corridor, and the north of the national park, where it meets the Masai Mara."

From £1,500 per person, flights extra. 
		 12 
		 VICTORIA FALLS Why You might as easily make a case for Iguacu Falls, but "Mosi-oa-Tunya" does a fine job of showcasing water in motion - the calm of the currents on the lip of the abyss, the roar as the Zambezi drops 355ft on the Zambia-Zimbabwe border.

		 13 
		 ULURU Why Whichever name you use to describe it, this muchrevered monolith is the dust and drama of Australia's Red Centre enshrined in one 2,831ft-high block of sandstone, rearing above the plains of the Northern Territory, bending sunrise and sunset to its shape. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "A walk around the base of Uluru is more in keeping

		 14 KYOTO Why It is a cliché to call Japan a "destination like no other", but the country at the far end of the Far East has a serenity and a soul that sets it apart - at least where the Tokyo skyscrapers and neon billboards give way to the quiet of Kyoto. The former capital is set back in time, dreaming of yesteryear in the likes of the Jisho-ji temple. Telegraph Travel tip "Spring and autumn are the most beautiful times for cherry blossom (April) and fiery changing of leaves (November), though these months are when Kyoto is busiest. To avoid crowds, try early autumn - or late spring." (Trips of a Lifetime: telegraph.

		 15 
		 THE GALAPAGOS Why Ecuador's fabled archipelago is almost as glittering a prize in the Pacific for 21stcentury 
		 travellers as it was for Darwin in the 19th - swaddled in a "Lost World" ambience where marine iguanas bask on rocks, and giant tortoises lumber across lonely landscapes. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "Each month has its highlights.

		 PRASLIN Why Even if only once in life, even the biggest beach-phobe needs to walk on a sliver of tropical beauty, and confront their preconceptions with soft powder under their bare feet. Plenty of Caribbean locations would work. The Seychelles' second island certainly will.

		 17 
		 THE AEGEAN Why If the Indian Ocean offers the loveliest alliance of glorious coast and calm blue shallows, Greece's inter-archipelago sea is not far behind it. True, the shoreline can be a little more rugged and pine-fragranced, but a week spent by the Aegean, sipping €5 (£4.40) wine from unmarked jugs at a waterside taverna, is surely one of 
		 European travel's simplest, and yet truest, pleasures. 
		 Telegraph Travel tip "On Crete, follow the north-coast road to the outskirts of Rethymnon. Stop anywhere along this beach-lined stretch for a 
		 dip, then escape the heat in the pretty jasmine-scented labyrinth of the city's old streets."

		 18 
		 THE MATTERHORN Why Mont Blanc might gripe at the suggestion, but there is no more prominent or recognisable an Alpine mountain than Switzerland's 14,692ft pyramidal peak. That you can ski in the shadow of the Matterhorn at Zermatt - even in summer, if you choose, on its glacier - makes it the snowy celebrity everyone should want to photograph. Telegraph Travel tip "Zermatt comes into its own from February onwards, when the sun is higher and the restaurant terraces beckon." (An Insider Guide to Zermatt: telegraph. co.uk/tt-zermatt) Perfect package A seven-night stay in Zermatt at the four-star Hotel Rex, flying from Stansted on April 3, costs from £1,248 per person through Inghams (0"3 791112; inghams.co.uk). 
		 19 
		 NORTHERN LIGHTS Why Though familiar from a million photos, the Northern Lights have a life-affirming quality, the sky swirling green and red. The Arctic areas of Scandinavia, including Sweden, are the easiest options for this celestial super-show.

<titre>Combine and conquer European politicians and regulators are starting to encourage cross-border mergers to create lenders able to compete against the Americans. France's Société Générale wants to be at the forefront. By Stephen Morris and David Keohane</titre>
<auteur>STEPHEN MORRIS</auteur>
<texte>
		Even by the high standards of the École Polytechnique in Paris, founded to educate the country's future business and engineering elite, the class of 1984 plays a remarkable role in European banking. 
		 The group contains Tidjane Thiam, Jean Pierre Mustier and Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, who run Credit Suisse, UniCredit and BNP Paribas, respectively. It also includes Frédéric Oudéa, the Société Générale boss who is Europe's longest-serving major bank chief executive.
		Still friends, the men occasionally meet to play golf. "We were very bad, all of us," recalls Mr Oudéa about a round a few years ago at the La Baule Club on France's Atlantic coast. "I think our balls went in the water. It was a disaster, but it was for fun." 
		 Those friendships could turn out to play an important role as the European banking industry considers a new round of dealmaking to create regional champions to take on the American groups that dominate the industry. 
		 In the decade since the financial crisis, Europe's biggest banks have largely struggled. Ultra-low interest rates, tougher post-crisis rules and the resurgence of Wall Street have made it all but impossible to generate decent returns. 
		 For the most part, European banking executives have eschewed talk of large mergers, deterred by fragmented national laws, rules and the memory of the calamitous combination of RBS and ABN Amro at the height of the crisis. 
		 But the dam may be about to break. 
		 Troubled by the parlous state of the financial system, eurozone politicians and regulators have given the first signal in years they may soon dismantle the remaining barriers to cross-border M&amp;A and achieve a true banking union. 
		 While many of his rivals are still wary of deals, Mr Oudéa openly courts the idea. "At this moment, which might be the turning point for Europe, I want to be able to seize the opportunity," he said in an interview at <meronyme id="1689">one of SocGen's trio of mirrored towers</meronyme> in <mention id="1690">La Défense</mention>. 
		 "If this consolidation, which is a logical outcome of a completed banking union, happens, you will have very few combinations. Do not imagine a flurry of deals, but Société Générale should be part of it." 
		 For the Parisian lender, a merger with a continental rival would make a lot of sense, giving it the firepower to invest in new technology and push back against the supremacy of Wall Street in trading and capital markets. 
		 According to Jérôme Legras, managing partner and head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, European banking regulators have made it clear that "the best way to fight negative rates is mergers, the solution to unprofitable banks is consolidation, so how long can the French resist?" Cause for optimism Mr Oudéa's 11-and-a-half years in charge have been bruising. He has presided over a 59 per cent fall in the share price while enduring a succession of misconduct scandals and a deteriorating operating environment. SocGen has been on a particularly bad run of late, opening last year with a profit warning and making thousands more job cuts, which have sharpened existential questions about its strategy and size. 
		 While his bank has been punching below its weight for most of his term, Mr Oudéa — who in the 1990s worked for Nicolas Sarkozy in government — is in no mood to quit. "I was appointed CEO at 45. I'm now 56, which is usually the age when you are appointed. So, I'm in great shape, I sleep very well and I must say I'm perfectly fit," Mr Oudéa said, flexing his biceps for emphasis. 
		 Many obstacles remain to banking union. National regulations still differ on capital and liquidity, not to mention incompatible bankruptcy laws and treatment of mortgages. 
		 Yet after many false dawns, bankers finally had cause for optimism last month when a historically recalcitrant Germany dropped its opposition to a common deposit insurance scheme, perhaps the single biggest hindrance to cross-border deals. Mr Oudéa said he could see the remaining problems being solved within three years. 
		 The chief executive thinks that regulators, worried about "too big to fail" institutions, will prevent any bank from running a balance sheet of more than €3tn. But SocGen's more modest €1.4tn of assets gives it "a margin of manoeuvre ... a size which offers some flexibility". 
		 "The supervisor will be very, very prudent," he adds. "They will want to avoid a catastrophe like we had in RBS," referring to the £46bn taxpayer bailout of the UK lender after it bought ABN. 
		 Deal rumours have swirled around SocGen for years. In the summer, Mr Oudéa flirted with UniCredit, run by his former colleague Mr Mustier, who lost his job at SocGen over a rogue trading scandal. However, the deal never advanced because of the probable credit rating downgrade that would have followed a takeover by a riskier Italian bank, increasing funding costs and effectively killing the margins of the wholesale banking business, people familiar with the discussions told the Financial Times. 
		 After also having a look at Commerzbank last year, Mr Mustier has now sworn off deals — in public at least. "No M&amp;A," he told the FT in December. "How can I be more precise?" Undeterred, the top brass at SocGen believe there is support for a new European investment banking champion better able to vie with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, who have been steadily poaching business from the retrenching French, Germans and British. 
		 A wide gulf has opened up. JPMorgan's $436bn market capitalisation makes it six times more valuable than BNP Paribas and 16 times more than SocGen. In the first three months of last year, the US group made $9.2bn of net profit, more than any of continental Europe's biggest banks earned for the whole of 2018. 
		 "When I speak with clients they don't want to be in the hands of American banks and I think that the regulators will not want to have such a concentration of risk," Mr Oudéa says. SocGen's chairman, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an Italian former member of the ECB's executive board, echoes these concerns. "Not having a European bank committed to the euro is not desirable, politically or economically," he says. "The fact that Deutsche Bank is refocus-ing is a loss for Europe. The Germans are starting to realise this, after so many years they are realising that having somebody that is committed long term, not just in an opportunistic way, is important." 
		 This fear underpinned German finance minister Olaf Scholz's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to push together Deutsche and Commerzbank earlier this year. Mr Scholz has said publicly that having stable lenders is a question of "national sovereignty" — perhaps stung by the memory of how during the crisis, panicked foreign banks restricted the supply of credit and retreated to their home countries. 
		 "French investment banks with local roots and senior management bring a perspective that is valuable," says Ross McInnes, chairman of Safran, the French engine maker. "We need also to be mindful of American extraterritorial measures, in particular on legal and conformity requirements, and building alternatives to payment systems involving the US dollar requires strong, broadly-based European universal banks." 
		 'We don't run CEOs out of town' Cross-border deals could provide a partial way out of the slump the European industry has suffered. Europeans' average return on equity declined to 7 per cent last year, less than half the average 16 per cent generated by big American banks, according to data from the European Banking Authority and Citigroup. 
		 Other potential partners known to be looking for scale and synergies include Dutch lender ING, which had an interest in Commerzbank, while Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's UBS also discussed a tie-up at the same time. 
		 Before SocGen can ink any deal, however, it must get its house in order. In an unimpressive field it languishes near the bottom in most metrics and is worth 40 per cent of book value. Of the region's largest lenders, only Germany's troubled Deutsche and Commerzbank trade at a lower ratio. Similarly, its RoE has dropped to 6.1 per cent, a far cry from its 9 to 10 per cent target. 
		 The shares plunged after February's shock profit warning and drop in its vital core capital level, prompting a strategic review that resulted in 1,600 job cuts and €500m of cost savings at the struggling trading unit, once the group's main profit centre. "SocGen is now one of the cheapest banks in Europe," says JPMorgan analyst Delphine Lee. 
		 If the lender cannot get itself into shape, executives are concerned they risk either missing out and languishing as others combine and grow, or being snapped up and absorbed by a healthier rival. 
		 "To be an active player our valuation has to be much better," says Mr Bini Smaghi. "So we are working on this. 
		 And to be fit, prepared and flexible." 
		 Mr Oudéa retains a lot of personal credit from big shareholders, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Amundi and Capital Group, for steering the bank through various crises. First came the rogue trading scandal that led to Mr Oudéa's appointment, when Jérôme Kerviel lost the lender €4.9bn on bad bets on stock index futures. 
		 Then a series of legal cases hit — bribery in Libya, Libor manipulation and sanctions violations in countries including Cuba, Iran and Sudan — which led to leading succession candidate, Didier Valet, also being forced out. 
		 Few think Mr Oudéa's job is at risk, even if the board has accelerated succession planning for an eventual retirement, according to one person involved in the process. Net profit has doubled from the level when he took over in 2008 and shareholders voted to extend his contract for four more years in May. 
		 "This is France, Fred won't be chased out unless there's another huge screw-up," says a school friend of Mr Oudéa, who is now the chief executive of another European bank. "We don't run CEOs out of town here." 
		 The most recent quarterly results provided some relief as the bank's core CET1 capital recovered to 12.5 per cent. SocGen's other main divisions have also been more stable and profitable. International retail remains a selling point, while the domestic retail business has been generating an RoE of 11-12 per cent, among the best in France. 
		 William Kadouch-Chassaing, Soc-Gen's chief financial officer, says a year ago investors and executives had "conversations [that] were not very friendly" but that now "we don't have major pushback on our strategy". 
		 Core operations The immediate priority is to fix the investment bank. Traditionally known for hiring engineering and mathematics PhDs, SocGen is still ranked number one in Europe for exotic structured finance products, such as equity derivatives, where the returns on offer are comfortably in the double-digits. 
		 However, it has been suffering badly in stock and fixed-income trading, where margins and volumes are in decline. Remedial measures have included shrinking its hedge fund services team, shuttering its proprietary trading unit and cutting its cash equity trading operations. 
		 "We were the inventor of equity derivatives, and then we were the inventor of structured finance," Séverin Cabannes, one of SocGen's four deputy CEOs, says. "We must refocus on our core DNA; Société Générale is a bank of engineers, that is the core legitimacy we have." 
		 The other option would be more disposals. After selling its Balkans consumer network and its Scandinavian equipment finance and factoring business last year, market chatter suggests that Lyxor, SocGen's €150bn asset management arm, could be on the block. Whether SocGen continues to forge a path alone, partners up with peers or plays an active role in consolidation, the bank still has its fans — even among long-suffering investors. "Over the last 20 years SocGen has never lost money, even when going through two huge crises, so their business model is very resilient," says Davide Serra, founder of hedge fund Algebris, which owns the bank's debt and equity. 
		 "It is the most undervalued company in Europe and, for us, it is a core holding. I don't need a cross-border merger to make money. If they keep going the way they are then I am sure the shares will reprice."

		The Reds have backed themselves into a corner by drawing with Racing at Thomond Park and failing to earn a bonus point in either Saracens clash. 
		 It means nothing less than a victory against Racing will do now at <meronyme id="1691">the indoor La Defense Arena</meronyme>. 
		 "We found ourselves in a similar position last year - same points but we were top of the table," O'Donoghue pointed out. "There wasn't as much pressure on that compared to this game - now it's do-or-die for us. 
		 "We've had a good week and it's really building for a good game. I came off the bench in that stadium before so I've had a bit of exposure to it. It's quite the spectacle but it's also very tough because the surface is so quick and the conditions are so hot. 
		 "Even at this time of the year it gets quite warm in there when you have a packed house and 30 lads running around. It does create quite a temperature. The ball gets greasy, it feels humid." 
		 With two wins from their last seven outings, Munster must somehow pick themselves up from last week's heavy loss at Ulster because they require their best performance of the season Absolutely," the 25-year-old Waterford man acknowledged. "We've had some good games. 
		 We were unfortunate not to come away with anything over in Sarries. We played well in patches. 
		 We need to probably up that by another 10 or 15% over here."

<titre>Fearless Finn can punish England warns Daly.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		ELLIOT Daly insists England will pay a high price if they lose concentration against Scotland ringmaster Finn Russell even for a moment of Saturday's Guinness Six Nations opener. 
		 Daly knows the "free and fearless" Russell has the range of attacking skills to orchestrate a first victory at Twickenham since 1983.
		Two years ago the Racing 92 maverick inspired a remarkable Scottish comeback when a 31-0 deficit ended in a 38-38 draw, the underdogs denied a famous win only by a stoppage-time try from George Ford. 
		 And more recently Daly was present for Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final defeat at <meronyme id="1694">Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> when Russell engineered the match-winning try. 
		 "The way he plays is very free and fearless. You have to be ready for everything. He might do a few things that come off, but you have to stay in the moment and limit them," full-back Daly said. 
		 "I've played against him a few times now and you have to anticipate some stuff that you wouldn't anticipate from others. 
		 "It's understanding what he sees in the game and trying to work out what he'll do, although you can't get it right every time. 
		 "With Saracens, we switched off a little bit and that was the game sorted. If you look back on that match, we could have stopped that if we were a bit more alert. 
		 "That was in the 70th minute, so it's about doing it for the full 80 and not switching off." 
		 England have turned to reality TV show 'Love Island' for inspiration as they look to forge social bonds when in camp at The Lensbury during the Six Nations. 
		 Among the tougher coronavirus safety protocols is a rule that players can only socialise outdoors, in areas that include heaters, a giant chess board and table tennis. 
		 "It's like Love Island without the weather! We've got the fire pit, so that's a tick," Daly said. 
		 "It's nice to have the option to do this, otherwise it would be very difficult to socialise as a group. 
		 "I know it's not the weather to socialise outdoors, but we've got heaters and open tents, so we're definitely able to sit with each other and have a coffee. 
		 "The new restrictions are definitely different. We thought they were strict during the last campaign. Now it's gone to a different level. But it's what's needed to play at the weekend so we have to get on with it."

<titre>Is now the right time to move to the country?</titre>
<auteur>NATHAN BROOKER</auteur>
<texte>
		Traci Slatton is sick of New York. The novelist, who has lived with her family in the same apartment since 1995, wants to move out of the city. Since lockdown, she and her husband, the sculptor Sabin Howard, have been staying in an Airbnb rental in Englewood, New Jersey, to be close to her husband's studio. Slatton's time there has opened her eyes. 
		 "My husband and I started saying: 'Why are we in Manhattan? Why are we drinking the Manhattan Kool-Aid?"
		Her disillusionment has been building for some time. Slatton is unhappy with the way New York authorities handled the outbreak of Covid-19. As of Wednesday morning, despite having a population less than a quarter of the size of California's, New York City had more than five times the number of coronavirus-related deaths.  
		 Live Q&amp;A 
		 Ready to make the great escape to the countryside? Before you do, address your questions on Friday May 29 at 12 noon UK time to buying agent Mark Parkinson, who specialises in rural properties. FT columnist and designer Luke Edward Hall is also on hand to give advice on decorating and renovating 
		 On recent trips to Manhattan to pick up her mail and run errands, Slatton has observed how the pandemic has changed the city. "With everything at a standstill, that kind of dynamic energy that people love in New York is just gone," she says. 
		 Now, the family is planning a move to the country, and has found a home on a few acres in rural Connecticut. She intends to sell her Manhattan apartment. "You get out into the countryside, you can put your feet on the earth, and you feel a lot more grounded," she says, "more realistic." 
		 Around the world, urbanites of all ages are considering doing the same - many for the first time. Exacerbated by the pressures of lockdown, city dwellers have been forced to confront the shortcomings in undersized, overpriced accommodation and are tempted by more space, greenery and lower prices.  
		 But after a decade of growth in megacities such as New York, London and Hong Kong - which have seen property prices rise and developers race to build lavish but space-limited accommodation - will homeowners turn rural dreams into reality? 
		 Dreams of escape 
		 In the UK, potential buyers are definitely pining for the countryside. Online searches for homes in rural and coastal locations have increased since the country went into lockdown 10 weeks ago. In the first week of May, the number of searches for homes in rural locations on Zoopla was up 68 per cent compared with the first week of March.  
		 Searches for homes close to the quaint coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon increased 126 per cent. Around Monmouth in Wales, on the edge of the bucolic Wye Valley, they rose 136 per cent. Near Godalming, a smart, historic market town in Surrey surrounded by countryside, interest increased 78 per cent.  
		 Other popular places were the rugged environs of Freshwater Bay on the Isle of Wight, and the diminutive city of Truro in Cornwall.  
		 Londoners especially say they want to get out of the city. In April, according to Hamptons International, 15 per cent of buyer registrations recorded in branches outside the capital were made by Londoners, up from 8 per cent in March.  
		 Gemma Shah, a 35-year-old Londoner, wants to move out of Brixton, a bustling district in Zone 2. She has lived there since 2008, and bought a two-bedroom flat in 2012. However, since lockdown, she has been staying with her sister in a house near the 5,000-acre Bushy Park in Teddington, a quieter suburb of south-west London.  
		 The sudden contrast of such verdant surroundings was striking: "When I first came to Bushy Park," she says, "I thought I had come to the Yorkshire Dales."  
		 Now she wants to sell up and move to Teddington, or nearby Surbiton or Hampton Hill. "I used to think that you would only ever move to somewhere like here if you had kids, but I'm seeing it through a whole different lens now," says Shah. "This period has cast a spotlight on lifestyle and priorities and what home means. [Now] I'm looking for something different." 
		 The great WFH experiment 
		 Ireland holds particular appeal. Rural property specialist Sherry Fitzgerald Country Homes has reported a 27 per cent increase in web traffic from the UK, and a 12 per cent rise from the US, compared with the beginning of the month.  
		 "The great social experiment of working remotely has been a success," says agent Roseanne De Vere Hunt. "Buyers are looking for a lifestyle change, given that they can now work from home." 
		 In Paris, a survey conducted this month by estate agents Belles Demeures de France and Daniel Féau found that a third of buyers with budgets between€500,000 and€1.5m say outside space and the ability to work from home will influence their search.  
		 Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, a director at Daniel Féau, reports increased demand in Paris's wealthy western suburbs, such as Saint-Cloud, which is nicknamed "Le Village" and boasts large family homes with gardens about a 15-minute commute from <mention id="1696">the financial district</mention>, <mention id="1697">La Défense</mention>, or a little longer to central Paris.  
		 In the UK, Andrew Perratt, head of Savills country homes, is not expecting a large-scale exodus from cities. But people wealthy enough to own two homes are changing their priorities, spurred by the assumption that they will be spending fewer days in the office.  
		 "The trend has been for people to have their main base in the city and a holiday home in the country," he says. "Now that's slipping, and people are saying: 'Let's keep a bolt-hole in the city but move our principal residence to the country.'"  
		 That means more people are searching for homes with longer commutes. Perratt's office has seen rising interest in villages surrounding the ancient city of Winchester in Hampshire, more than an hour's journey from London Waterloo station - a reasonable commute one or two days a week. 
		 Air quality matters increasingly to buyers, too. This month, London property portal SearchSmartly included air pollution scores for all its listings for the first time. 
		 A luxury three-bedroom apartment at Centre Point in central London costs £7.225m, but the air pollution rating is high. At the property, the annual average level of nitrogen dioxide is 49.85 micrograms per cubic metre; according to guidelines set by the World Health Organization, the average annual limit is 40 micrograms per cubic metre.  
		 Londoners can check the air quality of their own address at Addresspollution.org, run by campaign group the Central Office of Public Interest. 
		 The drawbacks 
		 Will browsers' rural fantasies lead to a rush in sales? UK buying agent Roarie Scarisbrick is not convinced. "Traffic on the website goes up when people are stuck at home," he says - a phenomenon evident every Christmas. But the desire tends to fade once browsers get back to their usual routines. 
		 "A lot of people like Instagram pictures of people cradling chickens, but the reality is often a lot less glamorous and a lot less fun," says Bertie Hoskyns-Abrahall, a solicitor with Withersworldwide who specialises in buying and selling rural properties.  
		 Where there will be a change, he says, is among the very wealthy, who can afford a second home in the countryside. "The consensus will be: I'm not going to go through another one of these lockdowns without a place to get away to." 
		 While a move to the country may mean more space and cleaner air, there are drawbacks. In the UK, some rural areas lag towns and cities for broadband and mobile coverage, according to an Ofcom report in December - though, since March, all homes have been legally entitled to request adequate broadband under the Universal Service Obligation. 
		 City dwellers are reluctant to surrender access to culture, restaurants and nightlife, as well as public transport and food delivery apps such as Uber and Deliveroo.  
		 Then there is the expense. While the average price for a rural home appears to be cheap compared with London prices, attractive period homes in good locations are not.  
		 Last year, the average property price around the Surrey town of Haslemere was more than £602,000, according to Hamptons; in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, it is just below £865,000. Anyone hoping to trade a small London flat for a smart home with a large garden here would be disappointed.

		 A £3m budget will not go far in prime commuting spots such as Henley-on-Thames, says Mark Parkinson, a director at buying agents Middleton Advisors. It would likely buy a house of 4,000 sq ft and a couple of acres - "in a good location, not exceptional", he adds.  
		 Running costs must be considered, too. That £3m house with cleaners, a gardener and other staff could cost up to £30,000 a year, says Parkinson. For comparison, the annual service charge on a £5.5m, two-bedroom flat at the Mansion, a new luxury development in Marylebone - with concierge services that include the use of a chauffeur-driven Bentley - is about £24,200, including ground rent.  
		 And if buyers do not like living in the countryside after all, will they be able to buy back into London? If, after the 2008 financial crisis, a homeowner in a prime part of London had sold up and moved to a prime part of the countryside, they would have gained £180,000 after trading like-for-like.  
		 If last year they had wanted to move back, accounting for the different speeds of house price growth in the country and the capital, that same buyer would have had to find an extra £419,000 to fund the move. 
		 No room for creativity 
		 For many, rising property prices in cities such as London and New York is part of a wider discontent with urban life, making housing unaffordable to all but the wealthiest. 
		 Parisians fed up with cramped apartments and the high cost of living have been leaving the French capital for years - often taking advantage of cheaper homes in Lyon, Nantes and Bordeaux.  
		 Parisians moving to Bordeaux were blamed for pushing up property prices when a high-speed train line opened in 2017. Signs popped up reading: " Parisien, rentre chez toi " - Parisian, go home.  
		 Those who work in the creative industries are often priced out of Manhattan. Traci Slatton says the parents at her child's school tend to be financial or legal professionals. "Most artists no longer live in Manhattan nor even close to it, because it's become so very expensive," she says. 
		 "Manhattan has become such a wealthy place. And there are some great things about that: it's fun to be ambitious, and to want to accomplish and achieve," says Slatton.  
		 "But at the same time you pay a human toll in terms of the soulful depth of your life. Now we're looking for a change."

<titre>Fairer funding models sought to keep rail costs on track</titre>
<auteur>PATRICK MULHOLLAND</auteur>
<texte>
		For two years of her undergraduate studies, Alice Best commuted to Sciences Po in Paris from her hometown of Chaville, near Versailles. The 15km trip took an hour by public transport, sometimes longer. "In the evening, if I missed the train because my class over-ran, I had to wait 30 minutes to catch the next one," she says. This was the first leg of a journey involving the Métro, the RER suburban railway and sometimes bus. 
		 Last year, Ms Best moved to the centre of Paris to be closer to work. However, plans are in place to improve public transport for Parisian commuters who are not so well located. Due to be completed in 2035, the Grand Paris Express is an ambitious rail project to improve connectivity. "The Big Eight", as Parisians call it, will loop across the French capital and sew together the banlieues, including neglected areas such as Saint-Denis and Clichy-sous-Bois in the north and east, to business districts such as <mention id="1698">La Défense in the west</mention>.
		Such grand plans are not cheap. Between 2013 and 2018, the estimated cost has jumped€12bn to€38.5bn, according to Reuters. But new transit infrastructure can have transformative economic and social effects on a city, says Jean-Louis Missika, deputy mayor of Paris. "You need to measure [its] impact . . . over a very long period of time to realise it is worth it," he says. 
		 Paris is not alone. Cities around the world are assessing the value of costly infrastructure projects and seeking fairer ways of funding them. Last year, the UK parliament's public accounts committee lambasted Crossrail, a commuter rail project in London, for an "unacceptably laissez-faire attitude to costs" after delays added £2.8bn to the £14.8bn construction bill. 
		 These projects are necessary, says Alex Williams, director of city planning at Transport for London (TfL), the capital's transport authority, as there is a limit to how much can be done with "sweating existing assets" and "improving signalling". What is needed is additional rail capacity, and Crossrail will boost London's rail capacity 10 per cent. 
		 New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority says that developments on the Long Island Railroad Main Line and East Side Access to Grand Central Terminal will add 45 per cent capacity. Meanwhile, four new stations in the Bronx and the Moynihan Terminal at Penn Station will link neighbourhoods such as Co-op City to Manhattan. 
		 The value of increased rail capacity in growing cities is the creation of so-called agglomeration economies: areas of concentrated economic activity where businesses are at their most productive, says Simon Jeffrey from the think-tank Centre for Cities. It is this phenomenon that generates healthy tax receipts for local and national governments. 
		 In China, where 3,000km of subway line is under construction and will be operational within the next five years, each kilometre translates to 58 jobs and a rise in house prices, says Mao Baohua, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University. These statistics primarily refer to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, where land resources are scarce and commuter demand is high. "Some prefecture-level cities in the central and western regions, such as Baotou, Datong and Hengyang have yet to meet these conditions," says Prof Mao, "and therefore, they need to be cautious when it comes to building subway systems". 
		 Although high-density cities stand to benefit the most from new transit infrastructure, they are also more expensive and politically contentious to build in. 
		 The climbing value of property prices in proportion to their proximity to public transport is one aspect from which policymakers are looking to finance projects. Past extensions to London's Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway "produced significant land value uplifts", according to a study by KPMG and Savills, the estate agent. These projects have mostly been funded by government, prompting TfL's Mr Williams and others to call for landowners - who benefit from these investments - to shoulder more of their cost. 
		 For example, the £1.2bn Northern Line extension to Battersea will be paid for through a 25-year enterprise zone centred on the Battersea Power Station, where rent payments will go towards defraying construction costs. 
		 "Crossrail was a cocktail of funding from government, borrowing and business," says Mr Williams. "From now on, every major project we do will require a similar model to get them over the line." 
		 Other methods include the Hong Kong "rail-plus-property" model that gives development rights to the MTR transit system, which profit-shares or retains partial ownership of any new adjacent property schemes. 
		 In New York City, the first phase of Hudson Yards, a private property development built over the MTA's train yard, opened near the extended No 7 subway line service to 34th Street last year. The project cost $2.4bn, but the transit authority has clawed back $1bn from completed transactions on some of the 60m square feet of office space and residential development. 
		 For Ms Best, better public transport is an incentive to move further out of Paris. "When I have children, maybe I will move back to the suburbs," she says. "One of my criteria is having reliable access to the city. Maybe in the future [the Grand Paris Express] will make it easier for me to do that."

<titre>Brexit vote stems flow of French bankers heading for London Attitude shift</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		The flow of French financiers moving to London to escape the tax rises of the Socialist government has ground to a halt, thanks to the Brexit vote . 
		 Senior bankers say financial groups have put the brake on sending staff to London since Britain's vote to leave the EU over concerns about the future of the City of London as a financial centre.
		This is a marked shift from 2012 when President François Hollande declared finance his "enemy" and proposed hitting the rich with a 75 per cent tax rate - the following year the number of people earning more than €100,000 a year in France moving abroad jumped 40 per cent, according to the government. This was an acceleration of a trend that led to 42,000 millionaires leaving France between 2000 and 2014, according to a report by New World Wealth. 
		 Many moved to London's South Kensington, sometimes referred to as Paris's 21st  arrondissement
		and home to the French Lycée school, to become part of the roughly 300,000 French people in the capital - an estimated third of whom work in finance. 
		 François Soulmagnon, director-general of Afep, the lobby group representing more than 100 of France's biggest companies, agreed the trend of bankers moving to London was now coming to an end. "The flow of bankers going to London has largely stopped," he said. 
		 Two of France's largest banks, BNP Paribas and Société Générale, say it is business as usual, with both waiting to see how the negotiations to leave play out. But a senior SocGen executive said that because of the uncertainty created by the vote, the bank is holding back from creating jobs in London, even if it is not moving people away from the UK capital just yet. 
		 "We've put planned internal transfers to London on hold," he said. "And when we're hiring, we opt for the non-London option whenever we can." 
		 A BNP Paribas executive said his bank was being equally cautious: "Officially there is no change in policy - but in practice we are not adding new jobs in London for the time being." 
		 There are growing fears that the City of London, which is home to some 250 foreign banks and the bulk of Europe's capital markets activity, will have its wings clipped when the UK does finally leave the EU. Many in Brussels want London, the dominant currency trading centre, to lose its right to clear deals denominated in euros. UK-based banks could also lose so-called passporting rights to operate across the EU. 
		 Some French bankers said that London also seems less attractive culturally, pointing to what they see as a more parochial attitude in the UK and the recent spate of anti-immigration hate-crime following the EU vote. 
		 Jérôme, a junior banker at a large French bank, said that following the Brexit vote he was no longer angling to be sent to London, saying he preferred Italy. He added: "London does not seem so cool any more." 
		 Indeed, the UK's vote has already helped Paris seem - relatively at least - more attractive to international banks. 
		 Laurence Harvey Wood, an employment lawyer at Freshfields in Paris, who works with US and European banks, said job cuts by non-French investment banks in Paris had slowed since the referendum as they reassessed their strategy. 
		 "Some restructuring projects in Paris are getting put on ice," he said. "Investment banks don't know exactly what will happen [over the terms of Britain's EU exit], so some prefer to wait and see how things stand in a year or two." 
		 French policymakers hope the end of the flow of bankers to London is a step towards a more momentous shift - financiers leaving London for Paris. 
		 Before the June 23 referendum, HSBC said it would move about 20 per cent of its London workforce - about 1,000 jobs - to Paris in the event of a Leave vote, saying jobs would go from the trading room and investment banking. 
		 Manuel Valls, French prime minister, has since announced improvements to the tax regime , including lower payments for expats moving to France: "We want to build the financial capital of the future . . . now's the time to come to France." Many, however, are sceptical about whether Paris can become a serious financial capital. 
		 Philippe Villin, a banker and adviser to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, said Paris "will never become a major financial centre" as long as the cost of employing staff and corporate and personal taxes are so "stupidly enormous". 
		 "Paris, compared to London, is not even as fun as it once was," Mr Villin added. "Nice restaurants are empty and the traffic has become terrible." 
		 Hop over 
		 Paris adopts clichés to lure City workers 
		 "Tired of the fog? Try the frogs!" <mention id="1699">Paris's business district</mention> has unveiled an advertising campaign that embraces longstanding national clichés in the hope of luring London-based workers to the French capital. 
		 The advert, which features a large frog wearing a French tricolore tie sitting in front of <mention id="1700">La Défense's skyscrapers</mention>, is the latest in measures aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote and attracting big financial groups to Paris. "Brexit is bad news for Europe but it's a fantastic opportunity for Paris and <mention id="1701">its business district</mention>," said Marie-Célie Guillaume, chief executive of Defacto La Défense, the body responsible for managing <mention id="1702">the finance hub in western Paris</mention>. "France is ready to welcome business and finance." 
		 <mention id="1703">La Défense</mention> is <mention id="1704">Europe's largest business district</mention>, home to 400 companies and 160,000 employees. <mention id="1705">It</mention> includes the likes of HSBC, Société Générale, EY, KPMG and Allianz. 
		 The lobbying effort highlights <mention id="1706">La Défense</mention>'s 3.5m sq metres of office space and strong transport links, as well as the wider cultural attraction of the French capital. The initial target is financial companies but it will also focus on the energy sector and start-up businesses.

<titre>'We're fed up of dreaming'-Racing 92 and Toulouse seek to end France's Champions Cup drought It has been five years since France last boasted a Champions Cup-winning side. Racing 92 and Toulouse are aiming to end that drought</titre>
<auteur>BEN COLES</auteur>
<texte>
		You would imagine that no one one wants Racing 92 to get over their European hump more than Jacky Lorenzetti, given the owner’s investment in the Parisian club over the past 15 years. Only Clermont Auvergne have lost more Champions Cup finals without ever winning the big trophy. 
		 Yet when Racing faced Clermont last weekend hoping to book a spot in the semi-finals, Lorenzetti was not in attendance. Nor was he watching on television. Instead, as he informed Midi Olympique, he was relying on a young Racing supporter decked out in the team’s blue and white strip for updates on the score, while Lorenzetti attended the wedding of his daughter in Corsica.
		“Between the marriage of my daughter, the victory in the quarter-finals in Clermont... I was overwhelmed,” Lorenzetti told the French publication. “Sometimes heaven decides to open its arms to you. There it was my turn.” 
		 Perhaps the only way for Lorenzetti to match that level of euphoria will be if Racing triumph in Europe for the first time, no mean feat given they first have to negotiate a semi-final against a determined Saracens outfit who have also already won on the road in the knockout stages, against Leinster. 
		 When Racing met Saracens in their first Champions Cup final four years ago it was a new experience for the Top 14 side and the injury gods did not favour them, as Racing lost their authoritative half-backs Maxime Machenaud and Dan Carter to injuries before half-time, with Saracens then powering away. 
		 Two years later in the final in Bilbao and Racing were once again without the talismanic Machenaud, having ruptured his knee ligaments after a commanding performance in Racing’s semi-final win over Munster. 
		 That injury on its own was deemed to be enough to write off Racing’s hopes against a Leinster side gunning for their fourth European title. As it happened the final itself was far tighter than expected, with Racing’s then stand-in, Teddy Iribaren, inspired in a tight 15-12 defeat. 
		 It speaks volumes about the standing of Iribaren at Racing that the uncapped 30 year-old started ahead of Machenaud and was named captain for the win over Clermont, kicking six penalties and converting Francois Trinh-Duc’s late first-half try. Whether Iribaren or Machenaud start-Iribaren gets the nod on Saturday-the No 9 position is always Racing’s focal point. This will be Racing’s third Champions Cup semi-final in five years and their third with a new fly-half. 
		 Carter and Pat Lambie, Machenaud’s co-conductors from the previous two semi-finals, are long gone. This is Finn Russell’s show now, adored by the French public for his attacking verve, even if it’s Racing’s power upfront that often seems to unlock teams. Their scrum against Clermont was so good that prop Etienne Falgoux was yellow carded after 27 minutes. 
		  That balance of grunt and flair all sounds great on paper and yet will mean nothing if Racing fail to get past Saracens in <meronyme id="1707">their rave arena</meronyme>, <mention id="1708">La Defense</mention>. As the veteran Wenceslas Laurent put it to Midi Olympique recently, when it comes to the Champions Cup, Racing are “fed up of dreaming”.  
		 Toulouse certainly know how it feels to conquer Europe but it has been a decade since last happened. Maxime Medard, now 33, is the only survivor from the 2010 vintage who defeated Biarritz in an all-French final at the Stade de France. Fly-half Romain Ntamack was not even a teenager then. 
		 It only took 151 seconds for Ugo Mola’s enthralling outfit to score in their quarter-final against Ulster, with Cheslin Kolbe’s footwork gazumping Jacob Stockdale. Yet otherwise in that first half Toulouse were noticeably out of sync, until Kolbe, almost cruelly, left Stockdale wondering what on earth had happened for a second time by skipping round him. 
		 You knew Ulster were dust when Sofiane Guitoune had enough time to adjust his shorts whilst making a break to set up Antoine Dupont. 
		 The sense last season was that a Champions Cup semi-final against a side as experienced as Leinster had come too early for a Toulouse group blessed with a handful of quality veterans-Jerome Kaino, Yoann Huget, Charlie Faumuina-but otherwise short of experience at this level. Dupont, Ntamack, Thomas Ramos and the rest, odd as it might sound, will all be better off for that heavy 30-12 semi-final defeat last season in Dublin, and Toulouse are a far better side this time with hooker Julien Marchand available. 
		 Watching them now as champions of France and playing some of the best rugby on the continent, we forget just how far into the wilderness Toulouse stumbled in the mid-2010s. 
		 Having them back should be savoured, but you could argue their return as one of the continent’s premier forces will only be confirmed if one of two things now happen; winning a second consecutive Top 14 crown-which no team in France has done since, as it happens, Toulouse back in 2011 and 2012-or by edging ahead of Leinster to become the first side to win five Champions Cup crowns. 
		 Given Exeter’s home form, Toulouse understandably go to Sandy Park as narrow underdogs, but there is a difference between a sold out, Tomahawk-chopping Sandy Park and the empty version that Toulouse will run out at on Saturday for their 12th Champions Cup semi-final (compared to Exeter’s first). 
		 “Teams that dominate Europe usually don't do it spontaneously. It is built over years and cycles,” Mola recently noted, before adding in reference to the growth rate of his young players that, “high-level matches save time”. Are Toulouse still cooking away in the oven? And are Racing ready to finally win this competition? We’ll know the answer by Saturday evening.

<titre>Michael Rhodes faces ban for Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final against Racing 92 Rhodes has been cited for striking Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw with his head in the second minute of the game at the Aviva Stadium</titre>
<auteur>CHARLIE MORGAN</auteur>
<texte>
		Michael Rhodes, the official man of the match in Saracens’ 25-17 win over Leinster on Saturday, could be banned for the European Champions Cup semi-final against Racing 92 this weekend. 
		 Rhodes has been cited for striking Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw with his head in the second minute of the game at the Aviva Stadium. Beth Dickens, the citing commissioner for the game, was of the opinion that it warranted a red card.
		The 32 year-old, also involved in a second-half flashpoint following a high tackle on Johnny Sexton that could have earned him at least 10 minutes off the field, will have his case heard by a three-person panel on Tuesday evening. 
		 Saracens would almost certainly lose their combative back-rower for Saturday’s semi-final, set for <meronyme id="1709">La Defense Arena</meronyme>, and the rest of the season should he be found guilty. 
		 Even if the incident, which occurred as Rhodes tangled with Henshaw at a breakdown in the build-up to Saracens’ first successful penalty goal, is deemed to be ‘low end’, a six-week sanction would result because that is the entry-point afforded to a strike with the head. 
		 If the committee, comprising Simon Thomas, Frank Hadden and Val Toma, deem the offence to be of ‘mid-range’, a 10-week suspension is the recommended suspension. 
		 Rhodes, who started the 2016 and 2017 Champions Cup finals that Saracens won, signed a one-year contract extension with the club this summer. He does not have a clean record – not that any mitigation would affect his availability for this coming Saturday. 
		 Last March, he received a three-week ban for a reckless clear-out that made contact with the head of Bath’s Levi Douglas. Back in May 2011, while playing for the Lions Super Rugby franchise, he was sidelined for 11 weeks following a dangerous tackle on then-Highlanders wing Siale Piutau. 
		 Given the influence of Rhodes, especially as a rangy lineout jumper, losing the South African would force Mark McCall into a significant rejig of his pack. One option is to shift Maro Itoje to blindside flanker with Callum Hunter-Hill, a late replacement against Leinster, partnering Tim Swinson at lock. 
		 Alternatively, Calum Clark, a specialist flanker, could start as a direct swap for Rhodes. Either way, the news is another setback for Saracens.

<titre>SocGen's maths geeks built an empire: do the sums still add up?</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE</auteur>
<texte>
		Thirty years ago, a group of maths and engineering graduates from Paris's elite  grandes écoles  changed the direction of one of France's oldest and most important banks. 
		 Under Antoine Paille, a 31-year-old software engineer, the small team was given a basement office a few streets from the Palais Garnier opera house in Paris with instructions to build a new business for Société Générale, the lender founded in the 19th century.
		Mr Paille believed that SocGen's dive into options and equity derivatives, which would eventually be packaged up for professional and retail investors into so-called structured products, could provide the bank with an advantage over its larger global competitors. He proved to be right. 
		 Now, however, after many of these products unravelled spectacularly throughout the coronavirus-induced market ructions, the Paris lender has had to take stock of its financial engineering. 
		 SocGen recorded a€326m loss in the first quarter of this year after revenues in its equities trading division collapsed almost 99 per cent to just€9m. Another shock loss landed in August after structured products were hit for a second quarter in a row.  
		 In response, Frédéric Oudéa, SocGen's chief executive, said the bank would slash the risk being taken by the structured products teams, resulting in up to€250m of lost revenue, to be offset with a€450m fall in net costs by 2023. 
		 The beginning 
		 "There was no training in universities in financial products. We had to learn on the job," says an early member of the group.  
		 In the 1990s, that job - for a team that included a fresh-faced Jean Pierre Mustier, now head of Italy's UniCredit - involved constructing products which limited losses while offering the chance to make money. From a $100 investment, $70 might be put into a zero-coupon bond, while the rest, after fees, would go into bets on stocks, such as a call on the CAC 40.  
		 A steady stream of talented maths graduates churned out by French universities, along with a plan to build centralised teams and sell the products at scale, allowed SocGen to steal a march on rivals. Insiders say a "start-up culture" allowed them to beat US banks which were selling bespoke products to institutional clients. One ex-SocGen banker said the US banks were not as interested in structured products because they were making enough money elsewhere. 
		 By the early 2000s, SocGen's equity derivatives unit employed close to 2,000 people and had grown into the bank's profits engine, accounting for 95 per cent of its investment bank earnings. 
		 Getting complicated 
		 Since then, French banks - including SocGen, BNP Paribas and Natixis - have become the global leaders in structured products, promising investors steady returns by using derivatives to smooth out the highs and lows of market moves. 
		 But the original products have changed, becoming increasingly complicated structures that tried to maintain returns in a world of low interest rates and copycat products.  
		 "Normally when we created a product, we'd have it to ourselves for about a year and a half, then others would start to copy it," said one former member of the structured products team. 
		 Simple "plain vanilla" guaranteed return products morphed into correlation offerings based on baskets of stocks, and on to autocalls, which pay out a coupon similar to a bond as long as losses or gains are within a certain threshold.  
		 "Everest was beautiful," another banker reminisced, remembering a correlation product that was sold to retail investors and named by Christophe Mianné, one of the leading lights in equity derivatives in the 1980s, after he saw a film about the mountain projected near <meronyme id="1710">SocGen's Paris headquarters</meronyme> in <mention id="1711">La Défense</mention>. 
		 Everest had a duration of 10 years and guaranteed that clients' capital would be returned. Additional returns were based on the performance of 10 or more stocks, with redemption based on the performance of the weakest member of that chosen basket. 
		 "We told investors that if you invest 100 then after ten years we would give you 200, minus the performance of the worst stock you chose," said someone who used to sell the products. 
		 If the worst performing stock went to zero, then clients received only their capital back and if all the stocks performed well they got the upside. The risk that all the stocks would move in the same direction at the same time was the bank's to wear. 
		 The crash 
		 The crash of 2008, when correlation products were hammered as markets did move violently in one direction, led to regulators stepping in and telling banks to simplify the opaque financial instruments which had become too complicated for retail investors to understand - cutting the number of factors the products tracked from 10 to three.  
		 Meanwhile, the Jérôme Kerviel rogue trading scandal of 2008 also forced SocGen to pull back from riskier corners of the market and forced Mr Mustier out as head of the investment bank, while Mr Oudéa took the chief executive job, changing the bank's path. 
		 The departure of Mr Mustier is seen by many inside and outside of the bank as a watershed moment, with a generation of bankers fundamental to SocGen's reputation for financial engineering following him out the door. 
		 Some critics and rivals believe the bank now lacks the expertise it was once famous for. 
		 "Oudéa was never comfortable with market activities. He didn't understand them, he put the brakes on . . . There was also a lot of pressure from regulators to reduce the risk in the investment bank," said one senior ex-SocGen executive. 
		 But SocGen did not give up on structured products, moving into autocalls, which one banker called "a start product every bank had to have on its shelf" and which became very successful after 2008 as it allowed retail investors to bet on volatility. 
		 Structured products were hit hard again at the end of 2018 when volatility across a range of asset classes caused losses for SocGen, BNP and Natixis on derivatives trades. Natixis was the worst affected, losing€260m mainly because of its range of autocalls sold to retail investors in South Korea, and promising to stop offering some products. 
		 "Structured products have undoubtedly been the jewel in the crown for the likes of SocGen and Natixis - so the market is wondering whether these cuts are an overreaction to short-term dislocation," said Omar Fall, an analyst at Barclays. "The cuts to dividends this year really feel like a once in a lifetime event." 
		 The future 
		 SocGen is not giving up on structured products, despite the hit from Covid-19 forcing it to pull back. Instead it is trying to walk a tightrope between reducing risk and remaining true to its core identity. 
		 It will do that, said Jean-François Grégoire, head of global markets at the bank, by trying to push new ranges of products that reduce the potentially large losses the bank faces in market turmoil, leaning once again on its ability to engineer. 
		 "The innovation that we've been pushing [this time] is completely different. It's innovation that goes towards creating products that are easier to manage for us and that are still very profitable for the customers," Mr Grégoire said. 
		 The bank sees it as an acceleration of an existing strategy - one product called Evolution was launched before the pandemic struck and can, said Mr Grégoire, reduce volatility risk "in any kind of situation". 
		 The broader challenge for SocGen and Mr Oudéa is how to rebuild an investment case for the bank - which is priced at just 18 per cent of its book value after its shares shed close to 60 per cent this year - as it pulls back from the products that formed the bedrock of its reputation. 
		 Retreat too far and he will be accused of squandering a traditional strength. But ramp up too much and SocGen will be seen as courting danger. 
		 As one equity derivatives expert at a European bank put it: "When you make too much money out of products like these, it's not because you are more clever than others - it's because you don't see the risk."

		Saracens suffer Champions Cup heartbreak to Racing 92 
		 Saracens suffered late Heineken Champions Cup heartbreak as Racing 92 claimed a dramatic 19-15 semifinal win in Paris. 
		 Alex Goode had kicked five penalties as Saracens overturned a 9-6 interval deficit and boost hopes of a fourth Heineken Champions Cup title in five years. But the champions were undone in the 76th minute when leading 15-12, Virimi Vakatawa charged clear and wing Juan Imhoff accepted Finn Russell's pass to score the game's only try which Maxime Machenaud converted.
		Teddy Iribaren (three) and Machenaud had earlier kicked penalties for Racing - losing finalists in 2016 and 2018 - as the 1,000 fans allowed in at <meronyme id="1712">the Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> savoured a famous home victory. 
		 Alex Goode had put Sarries up 15-9 with an effective kick-and-chase game turning the screw on Racing. 
		 Alex Lewington might have put the issue beyond doubt on a breakaway, but he chose to gather rather than hack on and was held up by backtracking Racing defenders. 
		 Saracens mainstay Brad Barritt was forced off inside the final quarter and his departure galvanised Racing, with Machenaud cutting the gap to three points. Vakatawa was at the forefront of a thrilling home attack and, although Racing were denied on that occasion, the centre ran clear again and Saracens' grip on the Champions Cup was loosened. 
		 Chiefs down Toulouse to make first Champions Cup final 
		 Exeter reached their first Heineken Champions Cup final after flooring French heavyweights Toulouse with a 28-18 victory at Sandy Park. 
		 The Chiefs' forwards drove them into a final showdown against Racing 92 at Ashton Gate next month, as prop Harry Williams scored two tries, number eight Sam Simmonds also touched down and skipper Joe Simmonds iced the celebration cake through a stunning individual score. 
		 Fly-half Joe Simmonds, younger brother of Sam, converted all four scores, and just 10 years after Exeter were promoted to the Premiership they are one win away from being crowned kings of Europe. 
		 The Chiefs remain firmly on course for a domestic and European double, a feat that has only been managed by three English clubs -Leicester, Wasps and Saracens. 
		 Toulouse's bid for a record fifth European title will have to wait, although they pushed Exeter all the way. 
		 They led for much of the first half, with replacement lock Alban Placines scoring a try and full-back Thomas Ramos kicking two penalties, before Matthis Lebel added a consolation score that Ramos converted. 
		 But Toulouse failed to score a point between the 36th and 76th minutes, such was Exeter's control, built on the back of a huge pack effort and impressive discipline. 
		 Richarlison penalty keeps Everton perfect after three games 
		 Everton made it three wins out of three as they topped the Premier League after a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday, won by a controversial penalty awarded for handball and converted by Richarlison. 
		 Carlo Ancelotti's side grabbed the lead in the 10th minute when a superb pass from Colombian James Rodriguez found the overlapping Seamus Coleman who slipped the ball across for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to score for the third straight league game. 
		 Palace drew level in simple fashion though with Cheikhou Kouyate heading in an Andros Townsend corner at the back post. 
		 But five minutes before the interval, referee Kevin Friend awarded a penalty, ruling that Joel Ward had handled. 
		 Lucas Digne had headed the ball at the Palace defender who appeared to try to pull his arm out of the way but, after being advised to check the pitchside monitor, Friend pointed to the spot and Richarlison drove home the penalty. 
		 Palace dominated after the break but Everton defended well to maintain their 100 per cent record. 
		 Ings earns Saints victory 
		 Danny Ings earned Southampton its first points of the season by scoring the only goal in a win over former club Burnley in the English Premier League on Saturday. 
		 The England striker, who finished one goal behind Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy's 23 last season, made it three in three games for the new campaign by netting in the fifth minute at Turf Moor. 
		 Che Adams ran onto a pass down the right channel and cut the ball back for Ings to bundle in a finish from 10 meters (yards). 
		 After finishing last season strong, Southampton has underwhelmed by losing to Crystal Palace and Tottenham and also to second-tier Brentford in the English League Cup so far. 
		 Burnley has lost both of its games in the league, to Leicester and now Southampton. 
		 Van Der Breggen continues Dutch dominance at World Championships 
		 Anna Van Der Breggen soloed her way to a second career rainbow jersey in the women's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in Imola as a Dutch rider won for a fourth year in a row. 
		 Van Der Breggen, who took gold in Thursday's time trial too, becomes only the second woman to double up with the road race and time trial titles in the same World Championships following France's Jeannie Longo in 1995. 
		 "It's incredible," Van Der Breggen said. "I must say it was a really hard race, we were fighting from the beginning and the climbs were really tough. In the fourth lap I felt strong, we discussed trying to make the race really hard and we did. 
		 "I just went for it. In the last lap everyone was tired and it was difficult to make the difference. I felt good and I went for it but it was really far." 
		 It was a Dutch one-two as last year's world champion Annemiek Van Vleuten, riding with a broken wrist after a crash at the Giro Rosa last week, beat Italy's Elisa Longo Borghini in a sprint to the line for silver, while Great Britain's Lizzie Deignan came home sixth in a chasing pack. 
		 Two years ago, Van Der Breggen won gold at the Innsbruck Worlds by going solo with 39km to go. This time she timed it a little earlier, attacking from a reduced group with 42km of the 143km route remaining. 
		 "I didn't think about that," she added. "The race and the circuit were really different to Innsbruck. There were some flat parts but it was difficult all the time. I'm really happy. I never expected this. I expected a hard race but it's incredible." 
		 Sciver inspires England to series win 
		 Nat Sciver took centre stage in the first women's international to be shown live on terrestrial television for 27 years as England moved into an unassailable 3-0 lead in their Vitality Twenty20 series against the West Indies. 
		 In a match broadcast simultaneously by Sky and the BBC, screening its first live game since the 1993 World Cup final, Sciver moved through the gears to amass 82 from 61 balls to help the hosts to 154 for six. 
		 Sciver's T20 best threatened to be upstaged by Deandra Dottin but the Windies opener's downfall for 63 from 56 balls ultimately decided the game as the hosts sealed a 20-run win at Derby's Incora Ground. 
		 Veteran seamer Katherine Brunt and young leg-spinner Sarah Glenn took two wickets apiece as a Windies side that shuffled their batting order following two heavy defeats were restricted to 134 for five under lights. 
		 But the limelight belonged to Sciver, who also chipped in with one for 23, as she clubbed nine fours and a six, shared half-century stands with Heather Knight and Fran Wilson, and injected some late impetus into England's innings as they took 38 runs in the last three overs on a blustery, cool and cloudy afternoon. 
		 The Windies used eight bowlers but were unable to stop Sciver until the final over and the tourists will now only be playing for pride after losing the first three in the five-match series.

<titre>SocGen: making the case for European bank champions</titre>
<auteur>STEPHEN MORRIS</auteur>
<texte>
		Even by the high standards of the École Polytechnique in Paris, founded to educate the country's future business and engineering elite, the class of 1984 plays a remarkable role in European banking.  
		 The group contains Tidjane Thiam, Jean Pierre Mustier and Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, who run Credit Suisse, UniCredit and BNP Paribas, respectively. It also includes Frédéric Oudéa, the Société Générale boss who is Europe's longest-serving major bank chief executive.
		Still friends, the men occasionally meet to play golf. "We were very bad, all of us," recalls Mr Oudéa about a round a few years ago with two of his classmates at the La Baule Club on France's Atlantic coast. "I think our balls went in the water. It was a disaster, but it was for fun." 
		 Those friendships could turn out to play an important role as the European banking industry considers a new round of dealmaking to create regional champions to take on the American groups that dominate the industry.  
		 In the decade since the financial crisis, Europe's biggest banks have largely struggled. Ultra-low interest rates, tougher post-crisis rules and the resurgence of Wall Street have made it all but impossible to generate decent returns.  
		 For the most part, European banking executives have eschewed talk of large mergers, deterred by fragmented national laws, rules and the memory of the calamitous combination of RBS and ABN Amro at the height of the crisis.  
		 But the dam may be about to break. Troubled by the parlous state of the financial system, eurozone politicians and regulators have given the first signal in years they may soon dismantle the remaining barriers to cross-border M&amp;A and achieve a true banking union.  
		 While many of his rivals are still wary of deals, Mr Oudéa is one of the few who openly courts the idea. 
		 "At this moment, which might be the turning point for Europe, I want to be able to seize the opportunity," he said in an interview at <meronyme id="1714">one of SocGen's trio of mirrored towers</meronyme> in <mention id="1715">La Défense</mention>. 
		 "If this consolidation, which is a logical outcome of a completed banking union, happens, you will have very few combinations. Do not imagine a flurry of deals, but Société Générale should be part of it." 
		 For the Parisian lender, a merger with a continental rival would make a lot of sense, giving it the firepower to invest in new technology and push back against the supremacy of Wall Street in trading and capital markets. 
		 According to Jérôme Legras, managing partner and head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, European banking regulators have made it clear that "the best way to fight negative rates is mergers, the solution to unprofitable banks is consolidation, so how long can the French resist?"  
		 Mr Oudéa's 11-and-a-half  years in charge have been bruising . He has presided over a 59 per cent fall in the share price while enduring a succession of misconduct scandals and a deteriorating operating environment. 
		 SocGen has been on a particularly bad run of late, opening last year with a profit warning and making thousands more job cuts, which have sharpened existential questions about its strategy and size. 
		 While his bank has been punching below its weight for most of his term, Mr Oudéa - who in the 1990s worked for Nicolas Sarkozy in government - is in no mood to quit. 
		 "I was appointed CEO at 45. I'm now 56, which is usually the age when you are appointed. So, I'm in great shape, I sleep very well and I must say I'm perfectly fit," Mr Oudéa said, flexing his biceps for emphasis. 
		 Many obstacles remain to banking union. National regulations still differ on capital and liquidity, not to mention incompatible bankruptcy laws and treatment of mortgages. 
		 Yet after many false dawns, bankers finally had cause for optimism last month when a historically recalcitrant Germany dropped its opposition to a common deposit insurance scheme, perhaps the single biggest hindrance to cross-border deals. Mr Oudéa said he could see the remaining problems being solved within three years. 
		 The chief executive thinks that regulators, worried about "too big to fail" institutions, will prevent any bank from running a balance sheet of more than€3tn. But SocGen's more modest€1.4tn of assets gives it "a margin of manoeuvre . . . a size which offers some flexibility". 
		 "The supervisor will be very, very prudent," he adds. "They will want to avoid a catastrophe like we had in RBS," referring to the £46bn taxpayer bailout of the UK lender after it bought ABN. 
		 Deal rumours have swirled around SocGen for years. In the summer, Mr Oudéa flirted with UniCredit, run by his friend and former colleague Mr Mustier, who lost his job at SocGen over a rogue trading scandal. 
		 However, the deal never advanced because of the probable credit rating downgrade that would have followed a takeover by a riskier Italian bank, increasing funding costs and effectively killing the margins of the wholesale banking business, people familiar with the discussions told the Financial Times. 
		 After also having a look at Commerzbank last year, Mr Mustier has now sworn off deals - in public at least. "No M&amp;A," he told the FT in December. "How can I be more precise?" 
		 Undeterred, the top brass at SocGen believe there is political and supervisory support for a new European investment banking champion better able to vie with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, who have been steadily poaching business from the retrenching French, Germans and British. 
		 A wide gulf has opened up. JPMorgan's $436bn market capitalisation makes it six times more valuable than BNP Paribas and 16 times more than SocGen. In the first three months of last year alone, the US giant made $9.2bn of net profit, more than any of continental Europe's biggest banks earned for the whole of 2018. 
		 "When I speak with clients they don't want to be in the hands of American banks and I think that the regulators will not want to have such a concentration of risk," Mr Oudéa says. "The risk of the world in three, four, five balance sheets? I don't buy that." 
		 SocGen's chairman, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an Italian former member of the ECB's executive board, echoes these concerns. 
		 "Not having a European bank committed to the euro is not desirable, politically or economically," he says. "The fact that Deutsche Bank is refocusing is a loss for Europe. The Germans are starting to realise this, after so many years they are realising that having somebody that is committed long term, not just in an opportunistic way, is important." 
		 This fear underpinned  German finance minister Olaf Scholz's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to push together Deutsche and Commerzbank last year. Mr Scholz has said publicly that having stable lenders is a question of "national sovereignty", stung by the memory of how during the crisis, panicked foreign banks restricted the supply of credit and retreated to their home countries. 
		 "French investment banks with local roots and senior management bring a perspective that is valuable," says Ross McInnes, chairman of Safran, the French engine maker. "We need also to be mindful of American extraterritorial measures, in particular on legal and conformity requirements, and building alternatives to payment systems involving the US dollar requires strong, broadly-based European universal banks." 
		 Cross-border deals could provide a partial way out of the slump the European industry has suffered. Europeans' average return on equity declined to 7 per cent last year, less than half the average 16 per cent generated by big American banks, according to data from the European Banking Authority and Citigroup analysts.  
		 Other potential partners known to be looking for scale and synergies include Dutch lender ING, which had an interest in Commerzbank, while Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's UBS also discussed a tie-up at the same time, it has been reported. 
		 Before SocGen can ink any deal, however, it must get its house in order. In an unimpressive field it languishes near the bottom in most financial metrics and is worth 40 per cent of book value. Of the region's largest lenders, only Germany's troubled Deutsche and Commerzbank trade at a lower ratio. Similarly, its RoE has dropped to 6.1 per cent, a far cry from its 9 to 10 per cent target. 
		 The shares plunged after February's shock profit warning and concurrent drop in its vital core capital level, prompting a strategic review that resulted in 1,600 job cuts and€500m of cost savings at the struggling trading unit, once the group's main profit centre. "SocGen is now one of the cheapest banks in Europe," says JPMorgan analyst Delphine Lee. 
		 If the lender cannot get itself into shape, executives are concerned they risk either missing out and languishing as others combine and grow, or are simply snapped up and absorbed by a healthier rival. 
		 "To be an active player our valuation has to be much better," says Mr Bini Smaghi. "So we are working on this. And to be fit, prepared and flexible. Then when the opportunities come, we will look at them." 
		 Mr Oudéa retains a lot of personal credit from big shareholders, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Amundi and Capital Group, for steering the bank through various financial and reputational crises after his battlefield promotion in May 2008.  
		 First came the infamous rogue trading scandal that led to Mr Oudéa's appointment, when Jérôme Kerviel lost the lender€4.9bn on bad bets on stock index futures. 
		 Then a series of legal cases hit - bribery in Libya, Libor manipulation and sanctions violations in countries including Cuba, Iran and Sudan - which led to deputy CEO and leading succession candidate, Didier Valet, also being forced out.  
		 Those legal woes are now mostly behind the bank with the exception of the Libyan case, which lingers in the form of an ongoing lawsuit from an ex-managing director of the bank and a key witness for the US Department of Justice, Elyes Jebali, who is suing SocGen for unfair dismissal, alleging he was fired after exposing the bribery scheme.  
		 Few think Mr Oudea's job  is at risk, even if the board has accelerated succession planning for an eventual retirement, according to one person involved in the process. Net profit has doubled from the level when he took over in 2008 and shareholders voted to extend his contract for four more years in May. 
		 "This is France, Fred won't be chased out unless there's another huge screw-up," says a school friend of Mr Oudéa, who is now the chief executive of another European bank. "We don't run CEOs out of town here." 
		 The most recent quarterly results provided some relief as the bank's core CET1 capital recovered to 12.5 per cent, back above its target, assuaging shareholders' fears it might have to raise extra cash. SocGen's other main divisions have also been more stable and profitable. International retail remains a selling point, while the domestic retail business has been generating an RoE of 11-12 per cent, among the best in France. Both are widely praised by analysts, even as the investment bank fails to convince. 
		 William Kadouch-Chassaing, SocGen's chief financial officer, says a year ago investors and executives had "conversations [that] were not very friendly, we knew we needed to do something" but that now "we don't have major pushback on our strategy". He adds: "We still have a lot of people to convince internally and externally."  
		 The immediate priority is to fix the investment bank. Traditionally known for hiring engineering and mathematics PhDs, SocGen is still ranked number one in Europe for exotic structured finance products, such as equity derivatives, where the returns on offer are comfortably in the double-digits. 
		 However, it has been suffering badly in stock and fixed-income trading, where margins and volumes are in structural decline. Remedial measures have included shrinking its hedge fund services team, shuttering its proprietary trading unit - named after Descartes, the French mathematician and philosopher - and cutting its cash equity trading operations. 
		 "We were the inventor of equity derivatives, and then we were the inventor of structured finance," says Séverin Cabannes, one of SocGen's four deputy chief executives. "We must refocus on our core DNA; Société Générale is a bank of engineers, that is the core legitimacy we have." 
		 The other option would be more disposals. After selling its Balkans consumer network and its Scandinavian equipment finance and factoring business last year, market chatter suggests that Lyxor, SocGen's€150bn asset management business, could be on the block. 
		 Mr Oudéa acknowledges the business is under strategic review, but says it "is not on sale today". The preferred route would be forming a partnership with a continental rival to gain vital scale in an industry dominated by trillion-dollar-plus US institutions. 
		 Whether SocGen continues to forge a path alone, partners up with peers or plays an active role in consolidation, the bank still has its fans even among long-suffering investors. 
		 "Over the last 20 years SocGen has never lost money, even when going through two huge crises, so their business model is very resilient," says Davide Serra, founder of hedge fund Algebris, which owns the bank's debt and equity.  
		 "It is the most undervalued company in Europe and, for us, it is a core holding. I don't need a cross-border merger to make money. If they keep going the way they are then I am sure the shares will reprice."

<titre>'The enemy is right there': French citizens told to stay indoors as Covid-19 spreads Macron drafts in army to transport the sick to hospitals</titre>
<auteur>ANTHONY CUTHBERTSON</auteur>
<texte>
		France announced drastic new measures yesterday in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, with the country's top health official warning that the situation is "deteriorating very fast". There have been more than 6,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, resulting in 148 deaths. 
		 In a sombre address to the nation last night, president Emmanuel Macron said that from midday on Tuesday people should stay at home unless it was to buy groceries, travel to work, exercise or for medical care. Anyone flouting the restrictions, in place for at least the next two weeks, would be punished.
		"I know what I am asking of you is unprecedented but circumstances demand it," Mr Macron said. "We're not up against another army or another nation. But the enemy is right there: invisible, elusive, but it is making progress." 
		 He said tougher action was needed after too many people ignored earlier warnings and mingled in parks and on street corners over the weekend, risking their own health and the wellbeing of others. 
		 Under the new measures, soldiers would help transport the sick to hospitals with spare capacity and a military hospital with 30 intensive care beds would be set up in the eastern region of Alsace, where one of the largest infection clusters has broken out. 
		 "The number of cases doubles every three days. I want our citizens to realise that there are hundreds of people who are sick and in intensive care," Jerome Salomon, France's director general of health, told France Inter radio earlier. "There is a real worry that the spread of the outbreak could saturate hospitals and this is something we absolutely want to avoid. This is why we must do everything to slow down the outbreak." 
		 Supermarkets and pharmacies across the capital suffered shortages of essential items such as baby formula and toilet roll yesterday amid a surge of panic buying. On Saturday, Edouard Philippe, the prime minister, had announced that all "non-essential" public places were to close in an effort to contain the spread of the deadly virus. 
		 Despite the closures and a notable decrease in tourists, the streets of the French capital remained busy on Sunday. Outdoor markets remained open, parks filled with people and local elections went ahead at polling stations.

<titre>An inside guide to healthy living in Paris</titre>
<auteur>VICTOR MALLET</auteur>
<texte>
		To stay healthy in Paris you need merely yield to the right temptations - choosing to walk or cycle in a city famously easy on the eye - while resisting the wrong ones.  
		 These bad temptations include gorging on "nuns" ( religieuses  - the pastry kind) and drinking red wine to excess while discussing existentialism and complaining about your fellow Parisians, specifically their tendency to complain. 
		Step by step to a better life 
		The strikes and protests that have crippled Paris transport in recent weeks have exposed to visitors one of the city's best-kept secrets: the French capital is small - small enough to walk across.  
		 Smug residents of the 20 arrondissements within Paris's ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique, already knew this, and many of us are accustomed to walking briskly or cycling across Paris to work or appointments. We do so not just because it's healthy but because it's often quicker and more comfortable, even in times of industrial harmony.  
		 The strikes on buses, Métro lines and trains over president Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reforms have made a necessity of virtue. The streets have been crammed with pedestrians, inhabitual cyclists, scooter-riders and, unfortunately, cars.  
		 Still, I was surprised by the manageable walk times shown on a map published by Le Parisien in the depths of the public sector strikes. Almost everywhere you would want to go for business or pleasure, except the Palace of Versailles and <mention id="1716">the business district</mention> of <mention id="1717">La Défense</mention> - both of them beyond the périph - are within an hour's walk of Châtelet, a transit hub in the centre of the city. From the Gare du Nord to the centre is just 30 minutes, and it is only another 35 to the Gare Montparnasse in the south.  
		 There's a catch, though: your journey on foot will inevitably take you past mouthwatering displays of food and drink in shop windows, especially the chocolateries and patisseries, so look away and keep walking. 
		 Vive la bouffe . . . 
		Now, about that food and drink. Anyone who frequented Paris in the 1980s or the 1990s will be shocked at how much habits have changed - for the better if you are worried about your liver or your waistline, for the worse if you are an Epicurean. 
		 It's rare nowadays for politicians or chief executives to indulge in the sort of long, languid lunches I recall having with civil servants and bankers when I was a Reuters trainee in the Mitterrand era.  
		 Even when such repasts do happen in the 21st century, the helpings will be mercifully small in a very un-American way, with the focus on taste and quality rather than quantity.  
		 The French are not averse to fast food. British sandwich chain Pret A Manger has opened a huge shop around the corner from the FT office in the 8th arrondissement and France has long been one of the biggest markets for McDonald's.  
		 Chefs and winemakers, however, are increasingly obsessed with organic farming, while restaurants like to source ingredients from a known terroir, preferably French and in the home region of the owner.  
		 France has not escaped the global obesity epidemic, but the self-discipline of Parisians and the focus on quality produce mean visitors still remark on the phenomenon Mireille Guiliano addressed 16 years ago, when she wrote  French Women Don't Get Fat . 
		 . . . et le vin! 
		The same rule of quality over quantity applies to wine. It is unusual for anyone to have more than one glass of wine at lunch, and often Parisian executives have none. French wine consumption has plunged from 120 litres a year per person in the 1960s to less than 50 today, but the quality of the product has greatly improved in every region.  
		 A British friend and longtime Paris resident told me how his French-educated children had criticised his embarrassing cross-Channel habit of pouring vast glasses of wine and chugging it like beer.  
		 Speaking of beer, beware of the high alcohol content of brews such as the Belgian Affligem, which sometimes approaches that of wine. It only takes a couple of demis to make that crosstown walk home a bit harder than you expected.  
		 And now to sweat it out 
		One drawback of Paris's high population density is the lack of green space. The green spaces that do exist are either not very green - French garden designers do love their white gravel - or ban people from walking or sitting on what little grass there is.  
		 For joggers and cyclists, the solutions are either the  voies sur berges , the routes on either side of the Seine (in the city centre, motor vehicles are permanently excluded from both river banks) or the expansive woodlands of the Bois de Boulogne in the west and the Bois de Vincennes in the east. 
		 Don't forget the city's numerous public swimming pools either - or their strict rules on types of bathing costumes to be worn to preserve hygiene and deter sexual predators. For women that means no monokinis or microkinis; for men, no baggy Bermuda shorts - the preference is for tight-fitting trunks.  
		 One good option is the Piscine Joséphine Baker on the left bank in the 13th, but there are 40 other public pools listed by the Paris municipal government to choose from. The famous Molitor pool, dating from 1929, is now part of a private hotel and spa run by Accor.  
		 Lastly, the city has a healthy number of public tennis courts, bookable online, including in the middle of the Jardin du Luxembourg, and a plethora of private yoga studios. 
		 For someone who has lived in smoky New Delhi and smoggy Hong Kong, perhaps the best thing about Paris for me is that the air you breathe, whether eating or exercising, is remarkably clean. As I write this, the air-quality index app on my phone shows a reading of 18, well into the "good" green zone and better than I ever saw in either of those Asian cities.  
		 Tonight perhaps I will drink a toast - modest in quantity and high on quality - to the healthiness of the French capital.

		 By Michel Rose and Tangi Salaün 
		 PARIS, May 11 (Reuters) - France tiptoed out of one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns on Monday, allowing non-essential shops, factories and other businesses to reopen for the first time in eight weeks as the risks of a second wave of infections loomed large.
		With the world's fifth highest official death toll, France is also re-opening schools in phases and its 67 million people can now leave home without government paperwork, although documentation is still needed for rush-hour travel around Paris. 
		 Theatres, restaurants and bars will remain closed until at least June, as the scramble in South Korea to contain a cluster of cases linked to nightclubs highlighted the peril of new outbreaks emerging. 
		 "Everyone's a little bit nervous. Wow! We don't know where we're headed but we're off," said Marc Mauny, a hair stylist who opened his salon in western France at the stroke of midnight. 
		 In Paris, boutiques on the Champs Elysees opened their doors to the public for the first time since March 17. In metro stations, staff handed out face-masks and sanitizer to commuters while stickers on train seats marked out social distancing. 
		 <mention id="1719">The capital's La Defense business district</mention> was largely deserted as most employees continued to work from home. 
		 Only 10-15% of staff were expected back in their glass towers, a number expected to rise to 25% in June and 70% by September, said Marie-Celie Guillaume, head of the state agency Paris La Defence which manages <mention id="1720">the district</mention>'s public spaces. 
		 "We're headed for a very slow, gradual return," she told Reuters. 
		 President Emmanuel Macron's government lifted the lockdown after the rate of infection slowed and the number of patients in intensive care fell to less than half the peak seen in April. The virus has claimed 26,380 lives in France. 
		 Manufacturing plants can re-open providing they put safety measures in place, which for some means not running at full capacity. People can only travel up to 100 km (62 miles) unless for professional reasons, funerals or caring for the sick. 
		 Trade unions and opposition parties have highlighted the risks that COVID-19 infections will pick up again, particularly in places where distancing is difficult such as schools. 
		 Health Minister Olivier Veran said France was ready to conduct 700,000 tests per week for COVID-19 to contain its spread. But he warned the government would reverse the relaxing of restrictions if infections spiked again. 
		 "If the virus were to resume its wild race, we would again take lockdown measures," Veran told BFM television. 
		 BALANCING ACT 
		 Macron is eager to rescue an economy in free fall. The euro zone's second biggest economy is forecast to contract 8% this year, and joins countries globally scrambling to rebuild supply chains. 
		 Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Monday said French carmakers, hit hard by the coronavirus downturn, must bring more production back to France in exchange for government aid. 
		 His ministry is preparing sector-specific recovery plans for the struggling tourism, aerospace and auto industries. 
		 "We are ready to help you," Le Maire said on BFM Business radio. "In exchange it's going to be, what's your relocation plan?" 
		 In order to help workers return to their jobs, kindergarten and primary schools reopen this week, and junior high schools later in the month in areas where the infection rate is low. Class size will be limited to 15 pupils and secondary school pupils will have to wear masks. 
		 The country is split into "green zones" where the infection rate is low and "red zones", including the greater Paris region, where the rate is higher and more restrictions are in place. People across the country are advised to work from home if they can. 
		 The public health crisis will leave long-lasting marks in France. Long accustomed to being told their high taxes paid for the best healthcare in the world, the French have been dismayed by the rationing of critical drugs, face masks and equipment. 
		 Macron's handling of the crisis has been criticised by opponents and swathes of the public and fuelled mistrust. His popularity rating fell to 34% in May, down 5 points from a month ago, according to a recent Elabe survey. 
		 Some on the streets of Paris said the lockdown had changed the world. 
		 "It's as if time had been frozen and now we return to a life that is not at all normal," said pensioner Aline Touil Dubois.

<titre>Lejeune: Le printemps--Amour, quand fus-tu ne?</titre>
<auteur>EDWARD BREEN</auteur>
<texte>
		LeJeune Le printemps--Amour, quand fus-tu ne?; La bel' aronde; La bele gloire, le bel honeur doner; Brunelette, joliette; Ces amoureus n'ont que douleur et tourment; Le chant du rossignol; Francine, Rozine; Je I'ay, je I'ay la belle fleur; Mes yeus ne cesseront i' point; Perdre le sens devant vous; Premiere fantaisie a 4; Quiconq' I'amour noma l'amour; O Roze, reyne des fleurs; Voicy le verd et beau may Ensemble Gilles Binchois / Dominique Vellard ten Evidence (F) EVCD069 (64' * DDD * T/t) 
		 Claude Le Jeune (1528/30-1600) was one of the more adventurous composers of the late 16th century and part of a movement seeking to restore the effects of ancient music. The collection of 39 works in Le printemps (of which 13 are selected on this disc) represent his work imitating the poetic forms and metres of classical antiquity, a movement encapsulated in verse by Joachin Du Bellay in 1549: 'Sing to me those odes, yet unknown to the French music, on a lute well tuned to the sound of the Greek and Roman lyre!' (La defense et illustration de la langue francaise).
		What sounds rather technical is anything but when sculpted by Le Jeune. Take his most famous composition, La bel' aronde ('The beautiful swallow'), in which five strophes of four lines are sung by four voices (these are called the chant) and alternate with a recurring refrain (the rechant). Ensemble Gilles Binchois beautifully capture the suppleness of Le Jeune's setting, clearly mindful of the composer's own advice that his music should be known 'as if by heart'. There's great warmth and care in this performance, both singers and plucked strings finding a brightness and lightness that complement the fluidity of these homophonic textures. 
		 Yet La bel' aronde is also rather conservative: I prefer the fluid approaches to tempo from Doulce Memoire (2017) or even the Purcell Consort of Voices (Argo, 7/72--nla). Similarly, in Brunelette, joliette ('Pretty little Brunelette'), despite beauty and shapeliness, the Binchois ensemble fail to sparkle compared with the light-footed dance of Doulce Memoire, who find in the first phrase a breathless momentum that matches the fall of the melody. Yet in La bele gloire ('To give beauteous glory'), the Binchois ensemble's a cappella performance is possibly the most exquisite on record, their statuesque textures being unrivalled in more sombre poetry.

<titre>Biorisk rules, New ship classification notations issued by Bureau Veritas.</titre>

<texte>
		ENPNewswire-February 2, 2021--Biorisk rules, New ship classification notations issued by Bureau Veritas 
		 (C)2021 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 01022021 - <mention id="1726">Paris La Defense</mention> - Bureau Veritas (BV), a world leader in testing, inspection, and certification, has released two new class notations - 'BIORISK MANAGED' and 'BIORISK SECURED'. 
		 BV developed these new standards following close consultation and collaboration with key stakeholders, including shipyards and shipowners.
		BIORISK MANAGED focuses on the establishment and implementation of an outbreak management plan, following the core principles of the Bureau Veritas 'Restart your Business' (RYB) protocols, the first such guidance available for shipping, introduced in April 2020 for the cruise and ferry sectors with the associated Bureau Veritas SafeGuard label. 
		 RYB and the associated label SafeGuard enable and demonstrate operators' commitment and policies towards COVID 19 - and other infectious diseases. RYB requires the identification of all potential risks in port, at embarkation and disembarkation points, and on the ship itself. An associated Outbreak Management Plan contains the procedures for prevention, mitigation, and preparation to manage crew and passengers with clear definitions of responsibilities and roles. 
		 BIORISK MANAGED covers onboard responsibilities and resource management, requirements for supplies, including PPE and medical equipment, procedures, behavioural and operational recommendations, appropriate training for the crew as well as the re-design or re-arrangement or modification of spaces and systems, such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC). 
		 With BIORISK MANAGED as its foundation, the notation BIORISK SECURED requires that further systems and hardware be installed including the provision of fixed and/or portable equipment. For example, a dedicated area onboard must be identified to quarantine crew or passengers in the event of infection detection. Such quarantine areas require monitoring equipment, HVAC systems providing at least 10 air changes per hour (including at least two fresh air changes). Recirculation of air within cabin spaces is only permitted through particulate filters with at least 50% filtration efficiency. Each cabin in a quarantine area must also have a dedicated air exhaust system which should lead to 'a safe area' (an area not normally accessible) unless HEPA filters, or alternative disinfection systems, are installed. 
		 BIORISK SECURED also mandates the furnishing of a ship with the appropriate equipment to regularly monitor crew and passengers' body temperatures. MSC Cruises today took delivery at Chantiers de l'Atlantique of their new ship MSC VIRTUOSA, the first ship world-wide to receive the BIORISK SECURED notation. 
		 Emilio La Scala, President of MSC Cruises Management, said: 'MSC Virtuosa' is the first cruise vessel in the world to receive this important new notation and this is something that we are all extremely proud of. It is testimony to the unique and rigorous nature of the health and safety protocol that we have developed in response to the pandemic situation the world is facing and that has allowed us to restart since August in the Mediterranean and safely and responsibly host nearly 40,000 guests thus far. We appreciate this further recognition of our industry leading approach designed to protect guests, crew and the destinations our ships visit.' 
		 Yves PELPEL, Senior Vice President Technical at Chantiers de l'Atlantique, said, 'We are very proud to deliver the first ship with the BIORISK SECURED notation. This achievement is the result of the fruitful collaboration between MSC, BV and CDA teams to increase ships' crew and passenger safety ' 
		 Laurent Leblanc, Senior Vice President Technical &amp; Operations at Bureau Veritas, said, 'Since the introduction of our Restart Your Business (RYB) initiative in April last year we have continuously adapted our approach based on experience gained and new guidance being available. RYB successfully provided a framework for ferry operators to continue operation in the pandemic and to put cruise companies in a strong position to return to operations - if and when conditions allow. These new BIORISK notations now provide a rule framework that provides an approach that can be adopted by any ship operators, of any ship type - and that can be certified by Bureau Veritas'.

<titre>RUGBY-UNION-CHAMPIONS-RAC-SAR/ Rugby-George rues missed opportunity after Saracens' Champions Cup loss</titre>

<texte>
		 Sept 26 (Reuters)  
		 Sept 26 (Reuters) - Saracens forward Jamie George was gutted to have missed out on another opportunity to lift the European Champions Cup following their heartbreaking semi-final defeat by Racing 92 on Saturday. 
		 Racing's Juan Imhoff scored a decisive late try as the French side came from behind to beat holders Saracens 19-15 at <meronyme id="1729">Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme>.
		"The way we saw it was that it was our last chance to compete for a little while," George told reporters. "We wanted to finish it off and I'm gutted, I'm not going to lie. 
		 "This defeat is a tough one to take because we had control of the game." 
		 The loss marks the end of an era for Saracens, who were condemned to relegation from the English Premiership in January for breaching salary cap regulations. 
		 They have two more Premiership games left before starting over in the Championship next season. 
		 George accepted Saracens face a period of uncertainty but took the opportunity to hit back at critics of the London club. 
		 "A lot of people have talked rubbish about us for a long time," he said. "But if you look at the squad here probably our best player was (academy graduate) Dom Morris, and if you're telling me we're breaking the salary cap that's an interesting one. 
		 "I don't know what we're going to be facing, but the young players coming through are hugely motivated and that is the exciting thing for me." 
		 Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall paid a glowing tribute to captain Brad Barritt, who was forced off with a head injury in the second half, and scrumhalf Richard Wigglesworth as the duo prepare to leave the club at the end of the season. 
		 "This result is irrelevant around the legacy that Brad and Richard leave at the club." McCall said. 
		 "We play Bath in our final game next Sunday and we will spend the tail end of the week reflecting on their contributions and time at our club, and give them the send-off internally that they deserve." (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)

		 Sept 26 (Reuters)  
		 Sept 26 (Reuters) - Juan Imhoff capped a flowing break to score the only try in the dying minutes as France's Racing 92 came from behind to beat defending champions Saracens 19-15 in their European Champions Cup semi-final at <meronyme id="1730">Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> on Saturday. 
		 The victory sent Racing, who have never won the title, into their third final at the expense of the three-times champions, and they await the winner of the second Anglo-French semi-final between Exeter Chiefs and Toulouse.
		After heading into the break trailing 9-6, Saracens turned up the heat, with Alex Goode scoring three penalties after the restart to give the Premiership club a six-point lead. 
		 Substitute Maxime Machenaud pulled Racing back to within three points with a penalty in the 68th minute before a moment of brilliance from Finn Russell sparked the game's decisive moment. 
		 Russell found Virimi Vakatawa with a delicate chip over the Saracens midfield and the New Zealand-born centre powered into space before offloading the ball back to the Racing flyhalf, who released Imhoff to cross with three minutes left on the clock. 
		 Machenaud made no mistake with the conversion, shredding Saracens' dreams of European glory. (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Clare Fallon)

<titre>Death without mourning: homosexuality, homo sacer, and bearable loss in Central Africa.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		10.1017/S0001972020000613 
		 Abstract 
		 Contemporary societies in Central Africa are known for their mourning ethos: communities often engage in endless lamentation upon the death of their loved ones. Yet people experience the death of a family member differently, depending on the deceased's sexual identification. While the death of a person identifying as heterosexual is generally felt as unbearable, that of a person identifying as homosexual is experienced as bearable. Based on field research conducted in Cameroon, this article analyses the way in which contemporary Central African societies experience the death of persons identifying as homosexual. Drawing on Giorgio Agamben's notion of homo sacer, the article argues that, as a result of the pervasiveness of anti-homosexual ideologies and procreationist doctrines promoting vitalis moralis or the ethics of life, childless persons identifying as homosexuals have become 'homines sacri' whose deaths arouse little grief from the community because their existence was perceived as 'bare' or useless even before their death.
		Resume 
		 Les societes contemporaines d'Afrique Centrale sont reputees pour leur ethique de deuil; les communautes se livrent souvent a des lamentations sans fin a la mort de leurs proches. Pourtant, les gens vivent la mort d'un membre de la famille differemment, selon l'identite sexuelle du defunt. Alors que la mort d'une personne s'identifiant comme heterosexuelle est generalement ressentie comme insupportable, celle d'une personne s'identifiant comme homosexuelle est plutot vecue comme supportable. Base sur des recherches de terrain menees au Cameroun, cet article analyse la maniere dont les societes d'Afrique Centrale font face a la mort de personnes considerees comme homosexuelles. S'appuyant sur la notion d'homo sacer de Giorgio Agamben, l'article fait valoir qu'en raison de l'omnipresence des ideologies anti-homosexuelles et des doctrines procreatrices promouvant un vitalis moralis ou une ethique de la vie, les personnes sans enfant s'identifiant comme homosexuelles sont devenues des homines sacris dont la mort suscite peu de chagrin de la part de la communaute car leur existence etait deja percue comme "nue" ou inutile avant meme leur mort. 
		 Introduction 
		 Recent scholarly investigations on LGBTIQ people in Africa have pointed out that so-called African cultures and family values often provide ideological support for anti-homosexual legislation enacted by a number of African governments since the early 2000s (see Nyeck 2019; Nyeck and Epprecht 2013; van Klinken 2014; 2011; Kaoma 2012; 2009; Nyanzi 2015; 2013). Officially, these anti-homosexual laws aimed at protecting the so-called traditional African heterosexual family against the danger of homosexuality, which was generally construed as antisocial, anti-kinship, anti-procreative, and above all 'bare'1 sexual behaviour. These moral and social norms, which enjoin any mature African citizen to form a family and/or to procreate, have often served as the main justification for the current witch hunts against LGBTI people in many African societies (cf. Nagadya and Morgan 2005; Ndjio 2016; 2013). In various African countries where social and political homophobia is endemic, citizens who transgress these pro-marital and natalist ideologies by deliberately adopting a non-conventional sexual identity or by engaging in an economy of sexual childlessness and non-reproductive sexual practices are persecuted legally and ostracized socially. Yet in his ethnographic study about the lives of the effeminate yan daudu male homosexuals in the Hausa-speaking region of northern Nigeria, for instance, Rudio Gaudio argues that these same-sex loving men who fulfil their moral and social obligations by marrying and having children are less stigmatized and can even enjoy some tolerance from the community (Gaudio 2009). 
		 Taking up these discussions about the complex representation of sex and gender non-conforming subjects in sub-Saharan Africa, 1 investigate the 'ungrievable' deaths of some single and childless homosexual activists in Cameroon who were not given the proper funerals as is generally the case in Cameroonian society. I will show how same-sex loving men and women who not only refuse to comply with the hegemonic heteronormativity of postcolonial African societies but also challenge what Lee Edelman has termed the politics of 'reproductive futurism' (Edelman 2004) are excluded from the regime of mourning when they die. 
		 The article is guided by a set of questions highlighting the growing problematization of death in the cases of some sexually non-conforming people in the wake of the generalization of a politics of sexual morality in present-day Cameroon. How does the sexual orientation and identity of a deceased person impact on the regime of mourning in Cameroonian society, where there is a growing distinction between deaths that are socially and culturally framed as 'grievable' and those construed as endurable? Why has same-sex identity become an intolerable evil or an unacceptable wickedness that makes some deaths not a sorrowful moment? What are the socio-moral representations of death in relation to the demise of non-reproductive homosexual subjects? Why do Cameroonian mourners, who often engage in endless weeping upon the loss of their kin, show no compassion for the death of an unmarried and non-procreative homosexual person? What explains the exclusion of the dead bodies of some homosexuals from funerary rites? What are the ideological, cultural and social underpinnings of this virulent form of homophobia that follows some homosexual subjects even after their deaths? 
		 Drawing on Giorgio Agamben's notion of homo sacer (Agamben 1998), or a sacred yet dispensable subject who can be killed or left to die at any time in total indifference, this article argues that the prevalence of both homophobic and procreationist ideologies celebrating vitalis moralis, or the ethics of life, and reproduction at the expense of allegedly unproductive homosexual eroticism results in the casting of unmarried and childless same-sex loving men and women in the role of villains undermining the continent's demographic dynamism. They are turned into homines sacri whose life and death are inconsequential, because they have already been framed as dispensable, useless or bare. 
		 This article is primarily based on field research conducted between 2008 and 2017 in the gay communities of Douala and Yaounde in Cameroon. My longterm collaboration with several local LGBTIQ associations (2) enabled me to collect data on the predicament of many underprivileged LGBTIQ individuals who were experiencing various forms of stigmatization on the part of the general public as well as their families. In addition, I had access to LGBTIQ associations' databases. The information gathered includes homophobic attacks, arbitrary arrest or imprisonment, and illness or death of peers. Information was also gathered on the lives of marginalized LGBTIQ subjects during visits to a number of patients hospitalized in public hospitals or by attending the funerals of some local homosexual activists whose deaths mobilized members of the LGBTIQ community at large. 
		 The first part of the article discusses the place of funeral and mourning in contemporary Cameroon--which is often presented as a mourning society. The second section deals with the de-ritualization of the dead bodies of some homosexual subjects, as well as the exclusion of their deaths from the moral economy of mourning even by their own family members. The third part focuses on the new orders of truths on homosexuality and homosexual subjects produced by nativist and pro-natalist ideologies that problematize homosexual eroticism in relation to a certain ethic of life. These discourses question the will of homosexual individuals to establish a family or to procreate. 
		 Death and mourning in Cameroon 
		 Like many Central African societies (see Vaughan 2008; Jindra and Noret 2012), Cameroon is a mourning society where any misfortune or tragic event that negatively affects people's lives generally triggers lamentation (see Gutter 2000; Mebenga Tamba 2016; Ndjio 2006). Yet despite the numerous tragic and unhappy situations that cause sorrow, no heart-breaking event arouses more grief and pain than death, especially when it concerns the passing of close friends, trustworthy colleagues, kin, family members, and so on. No other painful occurrence makes people feel as miserable as death. 
		 Death may be a trigger of social disorders within a society; it might exacerbate conflicts within the community and among family members, especially when it prompts witchcraft accusations that the deceased might have been mystically killed by a relative, or when it leads to a struggle for control over the deceased's fortune among siblings and other family members (Goody 1962; Ashforth 2005; Geschiere 1997). However, death may also reinforce communal spirit and solidarity among family members, or dramatize a sense of belonging among members of a clan or an ethnic group, as Anthony Appiah's seminal In My Father's House indicates (Appiah 1992; see also Geschiere 2005; Reynolds Whyte 2005). This is why people generally mourn on the occasion of the death of a close relative. 
		 Yet over the past three decades mourning has taken a more dramatic turn in this country whose cities have been transformed into 'necropolises' (Ndjio 2006), and where insecurity, violence and terror have become the daily experience of the vast majority of city dwellers whose lives are permanently subject to the power of uncertainty, and above all to the tyranny of death. Because of the pervasiveness of death and the polymorphous presence of tragedy, contemporary Cameroonian society has become a grieving society where corpse removals, funerals and burial ceremonies permeate everyday life (see Beuvier 2014; Gufler 2000; Ndjio 2006). Indeed, in most of the country's urban areas, it is common to see long processions of mourners every weekend, as they block the city's main roads while accompanying, amid wailing chants, the dead body of their relative or family member from the mortuary or the deceased's home to the cemetery (cf. Mebenga Tamba 2015; 2009), 
		 By a mourning society I mean here not only a society where one 'cries the death', to paraphrase Hermann Gufler, who has studied the rituals of death among the Yamba populations of the western Grassfields region of Cameroon (Gufler 2000), but also a society that saturates its public sphere with funeral services dramatizing the power of death and its grip on the lives of its members (Ashforth 2005; Jindra and Noret 2012; Dilger and Luig 2013). In addition, a mourning society is a society in which it is virtually impossible not to be regularly disturbed or annoyed by the lamenting cries of women from the neighbourhood, or the weeping of a neighbouring friend, colleague or fellow passenger in the bus or taxi, saddened by the unexpected demise of a close relative or family member. Moreover, the concept accounts for a community in which people spend much of their time noisily mourning loved ones who have passed away, especially when the deceased was the family's breadwinner (Gufler 2000). People often weep so copiously that they collapse or lose strength and have to be taken to a local healthcare centre for emergency care. 
		 Contemporary Cameroonian society attaches so much importance to mourning that the mortuaries of some public hospitals set aside a special place to enable people to mourn their deceased relatives without disturbing other visitors or patients. Because of the growing social and symbolic importance of mourning in recent years, several groups of professional female mourners are often hired by bereaved families to animate funerals and wakes with their affected and exaggerated lamentations; their prices vary according to the nature of the women's spectacle, and especially the tonality of their crying or screaming (see Beuvier 2014; De Boeck and Plissart 2004). Weeping for deceased people with whom one has no social or cultural ties is one of the mutations in the African moral economy of mourning noted by Cameroonian anthropologist Luc Mebenga Tamba. These manifestations mark a new phenomenon, distinct from mourning rituals linked to a regime of kinship and ethnicity or friendship bonds, where it is assumed that we mourn only those with whom we share some ties or connections (Mebenga Tamba 2015). 
		 Despite the fact that people in contemporary Cameroon increasingly respond to the death of their nearest and dearest with weeping, most Cameroonians still discriminate when mourning their next of kin or relatives who have passed away. As will be demonstrated in the next section, the same people who are keen to give themselves up to unending mourning and unrelenting laments when some members of their family pass away often show indifference when other members die. 
		 Homo sacer. the untouchables, the spectres and ungrievable death 
		 In urban popular language in Cameroon, pleureurs (convulsive mourners) refers to people who are unable to contain their grief, bereaved by the death of their loved ones. Yet Cameroonians do not always feel grief when death strikes in their community. This discrimination, which is at the heart of the mourning regime in Cameroon, can be related to pervasive customary cultural practices and imaginations that establish a moral distinction between deaths. Indeed, in this country, as in many other African societies, some types of death are represented as 'good deaths' while others are construed as 'bad deaths' (van der Geest 2004; Kalusa and Vaughan 2013). In her analysis of the social representation of bereavement among the Meru populations of Tanzania, for example, Liv Haram notes that these mountain people generally conceive of death in terms of 'good death' and 'bad death'. She defines a good death as one reserved for 'people who have lived long and prosperous lives or have been blessed with lots of children and great-grandchildren, and have lived as good, moral people' (Haram 2013: 226-7). People whose deaths are perceived as good deaths will be 'properly and heavily mourned' (ibid.: 227). Moreover, these deceased people will be given a 'proper funeral with many visiting mourners' (ibid. : 227). There are some types of death that are considered 'bad' because they are 'a waste of time and money' (ibid.: 223) for the bereaved families or relatives. From an emotional point of view, a good death is generally experienced by many people as unbearable and mournful, while a bad death is often lived as bearable and untroubled. The spread of HIV/A1DS has increased bad deaths in most African communities, where people are tired of attending funerals and burial ceremonies (ibid.: 223). 
		 This article proposes a new interpretation of these tricky concepts of 'good' and 'bad' deaths. It does so by underlining not the socio-economic profile or social status of the deceased, on which most studies rely for an understanding of death as either good or bad; instead, it focuses on marginality, notably the marginal sexual identity of the deceased person, as a critical concept to analyse the framing of some deaths as bad or bearable. 
		 Since the explosion of a violent political and social homophobia that has rocked most African countries over the past decade (see Geschiere 2017; Epprecht 2013; 2008; Hoad 2007; Kaoma 2012; 2009; Bosia and Weiss 2013; van Klinken 2014; 2011), people who are declared to be or suspected of being 'homosexual' have become the new recluses in a number of African communities. Even public medical institutions have been turned into places of medical discrimination, effectively excluding patients whose unconventional sexual identity does not fit the heteronormative values promoted by many postcolonial African governments (cf. Ndjio 2012). In postcolonial medical discrimination, in a certain sense patients identified as 'homosexual' have taken the place formerly occupied by mentally disturbed people, lepers and HIV/A1DS sufferers. If the current medical order has more or less trivialized or 'normalized' the presence in health centres of other marginal social categories, this does not yet seem to be the case for patients identified as 'homosexual'. 
		 The recent eruption of sick homosexual bodies in the public arena has marked a significant epochal shift in the moral economy of the stigmatization of'homosexual' subjects, who are increasingly seen as dangerous 'sexual aliens' (Ndjio 2016). This 'othering' of sexual minorities should be seen in the context of the Cameroonian government's anti-homosexual politics and its violent exercise of sovereign power over the lives of persons identifying as homosexual. The dissident sexuality of the latter threatens the alleged homogeneous heterosexual Cameroonian community, while destabilizing the national sexual boundaries the postcolonial state has established between so-called 'authentic' and 'autochthonous' sexual practices and those construed as 'alien' (see Ndjio 2012; Lado 2011; Nyeck and Epprecht 2013). In addition, a dominant nativist representation of homosexuality as an un-African, Western-imported sexual practice has led to the profiling of 'homosexual' subjects who are considered to be uprooted Africans who flout so-called African traditional sexual norms and values (cf. Ndjio 2013). In some instances, same-sex loving people are politically or socially branded as enemies from within or traitors to the nation, and therefore routinely subjected to state violence (see Ndjio 2016). 
		 In many respects, in contemporary Cameroonian society homosexual subjects now epitomize a modern type of homo sacer, a marginal figure in Roman law that was popularized by Giorgio Agamben (1998). In contrast to Agamben's discussion of this concept with respect to sovereign power and a certain form of biopolitics, I conceptualize this notion with reference to individuals who, because of their dissident sexual identity and orientation, have lost the social right to be mourned according to their society's customs. The figure of homo sacer symbolizes those outcasts whose demise is similar to those of the chiens ecrases (run-over dogs) for which nobody is willing to make a death announcement; this concept also refers to people who are buried like mad dogs. These are people whose lives have been made 'une vie nue' (a bare life, in the sense of an unworthy and less valuable life) because their very existence is thought to bring dishonour to their family and their community. 
		 In times of what Simon Watney calls the expansion of the 'politics of intense moral purity' (1990: 100), the archetype of a barren and unattached 'homosexual' becomes not only 'the spectre of a world driven by desire sans ethical commitment', as Jean Comaroff (2007: 223) would put it, but also the iconic figure of someone who can be subjected to a bare death. The homosexual subject is a symbol of the untouchable: their dead body cannot be touched by any family member because it is associated with notions of disgust, danger and pollution. (3) In many respects, the agony of people identified as 'homosexual', whose family and community members leave them unattended in hospitals, where they often experience medical neglect, or who are deprived of their basic human right to be properly buried or offered a decent funeral, recalls Joao Biehl's description of poor Afro-Brazilians as homines sacri who are confined to 'zones of abandonment' because they belong neither to the world of the living nor to that of the dead (Biehl 2001). 
		 In Cameroon, as in a number of sub-Saharan African societies, the bodies of heterosexually identified subjects belong either to the community or to the family (see Reynolds Whyte 2005; Geissler and Prince 2013). Sometimes the state or government can lay claim to the dead bodies of citizens who are identified as homosexuals for purposes of juridical or police investigation. Yet a number of cases recorded during my fieldwork suggest that the bodies of persons identified as 'homosexuals' belong to nobody; that is why they can be abandoned in the mortuaries or dumped in communal graves. When the thirty-one-year-old LGBTIQ activist with whom I was working died of AIDS in 2011, his body was abandoned in the mortuary of Yaounde Central Hospital by his relatives, who had not helped the deceased during the long illness that finally claimed his life. Both his illness and his death dramatized the conflict with his devoutly religious family over his sexual orientation. Indeed, the young LGBTIQ activist considered himself the 'black sheep of [his] family that no one cares about'. When asked to explain his relationship with his family during an education workshop I was coordinating together with a human rights lawyer from Yaounde in a local LGBTIQ headquarters in 2010, Olivier (4) made these comments: 
		 
  I used to live with my uncle, my mother's younger brother, and
  everything was fine between him and me, even if there were rumours
  circulating in the neighbourhood that I was a homosexual and slept
  with men. But I always denied it each time he asked me about my
  alleged homosexuality. Unfortunately, one evening he came home
  unexpectedly from a trip and caught me having sex in the living
  room with my boyfriend at the time. I was thrown out of his house
  like an unclean person [malpropre], I had to give up my studies
  because he stopped paying my school fees. Now I no longer have
  family; my new family are my friends from the LGBTIQ movement. We
  support each other; that is the most important thing for me.
  
		 Following Olivier's death, the hospital authorities made several unsuccessful public announcements and threatened to bury the young man's body in a fosse commune (communal grave) if family members did not come to collect it. They changed their minds only after some members of an LGBT1Q association to which the deceased was connected finally agreed to take care of this unwanted body. Being left to be buried by people who are not the deceased's relatives is one of the most socially unacceptable forms of desacralization and dehumanization of the dead in Cameroonian society. Likewise, being buried in a communal grave and away from one's soil or ancestral land is tantamount to equating the dead body with that of a mad dog or the most despised or marginal social figure. And this is what happened to the dead body of the young, unmarried LGBTIQ activist. 
		 Thus, by refusing to retrieve from the hospital mortuary the body of their deceased kin and by relinquishing it to the hospital authorities, who themselves handed it over to members of a local LGBTIQ association, who in turn finally managed to bury it in a small cemetery, the family clearly indicated that this body, which had already been socially alienated during the man's lifetime, was no longer theirs or had ceased to belong to the community. 
		 We don't mourn faggots 
		 Dying gay and childless is a double punishment you can inflict on your family. (5) 
		 During my fieldwork in various neighbourhoods of Yaounde and Douala, my two research assistants, who were connected to the local LGBTIQ milieu, and I recorded a number of cases that give some hints as to the way in which contemporary Cameroonian society deals with the deaths of people with transgressive sexual identities or of people identified as homosexual and childless in their lifetime. Over the course of June 2011, for example, a well-known Cameroonian LGBTIQ activist died of infections complicated by HIV/AIDS at Yaounde Central Hospital, where he was hospitalized less than two weeks after his release from Kondengui Central Prison having spent more than a year in custody on suspicion of 'homosexuality'. No local tabloid alluded to the passing of a man who was a prominent figure in LGBTIQ activism in Cameroon. Nor did his death trigger any form of mobilization of the community at large, as had happened when the populist and anti-homosexual intellectual Charles Ateba Eyene died on 21 February 2014. In the family house where the funeral took place (despite the reluctance of the head of the family, who had initially requested that the funeral be held elsewhere), only a few people attended what some people from the neighbourhood branded a 'deuil d'un pede' (funeral of a faggot). Even the famous veillees funebres (funeral wakes), which generally attract many people from the neighbourhood, recorded a very poor attendance. Most of the participants were the deceased's fellow homosexuals, who reportedly were admonished by one family member to keep a low profile and not to exhibit themselves in such a gathering where gay people were not welcome. 
		 At his burial, which took place in a small cemetery in Yaounde, only four of his LGBTIQ colleagues showed up to pay their last respects to a dear friend with whom they were engaged in the gay liberation movement in Cameroon. None of his close relatives considered it necessary to take part in the funeral--not even his mother, despite him being her only male child, She, like other family members, had severed all ties after the deceased's sexual orientation had been disclosed publicly. This explains why there was neither mourning nor weeping for this asocial death. 
		 Despite the fact that Mr Eloundou was a fervent and devout Christian, he was denied the right to be buried as a Christian because the Catholic clergy were categorically opposed to the idea of a homosexual man, who epitomized what Michel Maffesoli (2012: 127) would call 'la sexualite du diable' (the devil's sexuality), being laid to rest in their sacred land. Even the priest who was hired by his friends to say a prayer for the deceased's soul turned down the request when he learned that the dead man had been a homosexual and a strong advocate for the decriminalization of homosexuality in Cameroon. 
		 Mr Eloundou's death highlighted the social alienation and radical otherness of a young man who was marked by his family as a sexual outcast when he came out in 2006. Indeed, in an unpublished report (6) documenting some aspects of Mr Eloundou's life, it was revealed that, prior to his death, the young man was sharing a studio with one of his friends after being expelled from the family home by his father, who reportedly threatened to kill his 'dishonourable' son if he ever set foot in his home again. Only one of his older sisters, who lived abroad, did not sever ties with him. In that document, Mr Eloundou explained why he was ostracized by his family to the point of being forced to give up his studies because nobody was willing to support him financially. One of the reasons why his father could not forgive him for his homosexuality, he stated, was that he was the only male among his parents' seven children. His father, a retired army officer, did not want to pass on his inheritance to a homosexual son. 
		 Likewise, during his lifetime. Eric O. Lembcmbe, a journalist and well-known LGBTIQ activist with whom 1 had previously collaborated on several research projects in Cameroon, maintained eonflietual relations with his close relatives; they did not tolerate the fact that he was openly homosexual and very active in LGBTIQ liberation activism in Cameroon. Like Mr Eloundou, he was compelled to vacate the family home and find a new house elsewhere, because his parents feared that he could 'contaminate' his two younger brothers with his homosexuality, as he once explained to me during one of our conversations. Thus, when he was brutally killed in July 2013 in what looked like a homophobic murder, I did not see any of his family members mourning or weeping for the loss of the thirty-three-year-old man who was affectionately called 'mademoiselle' or 'la go' (young and sexy girl) by his friends. None of his family members showed any hint of sorrow or grief. Despite the fact that Eric Lembembe was a social junior who had not yet fulfilled his social obligations towards his community (to marry and have children), his family found his death not too hard to bear. 
		 During the veillees funebres that 1 and some members of two well-known local LGBTIQ human rights associations attended, I was confused by the unfriendly and unemotional ambience of the ceremony, which contrasted with the generally animated and lively atmosphere of such an event. My confusion led me to ask a middle-aged man who was sitting next to me why the vigil for the young man had attracted only a few people and why there was so little show of mourning, unlike what would otherwise be common practice in Cameroonian society. The man gave me this simple and straightforward response that alerted me to the changes in the local imagination and experience of mourning: 'Chez nous les Beti on ne pleure pas les pedes [We the Beti people don't mourn faggots].' 'Le deuil c'est pour les personnes normales et non les gens qui font les choses du diable [Funerals are reserved for normal people and not for people who do devilish things].' The man did not need to explain further why the bereaved family was unwilling to give a proper and respectful funeral to its deceased member, or why the deuil (funeral) of the homosexual person was de-culturalized and de-Africanized to the point of bearing a resemblance to funerals performed in the Western world. Indeed, what I witnessed that evening in a popular neighbourhood of Yaounde had nothing to do with the highly culturalized and ethnicized funerals I was accustomed to attending in many areas of Douala and Yaounde. The culturally and socially alienated funerals of young deceased LGBTIQ activists were similar to those generally reserved for marginal figures of society who have been de-socialized, notably people accused of practising witchcraft or persons who have committed suicide. 
		 In May 2012, Nadine, a twenty-five-year-old lesbian woman, who was my master's degree student and one of my research assistants, died of what was officially recorded as severe cerebral malaria. As an only child, she was the pride of her middle-class parents, who had great expectations for her. Fier sudden death was a hard blow for them. But there was something that her parents did not know about their daughter's intimate life: her homosexuality. It was a secret she had always managed to hide from her conservative parents, who would have been devastated if they had learned that their beloved child loved women and had no intention of marrying or having children, as they had hoped. That is why she never turned up in the family home with any woman whose appearance might have aroused suspicion in her parents. 
		 But during her funeral service at the mortuary of Douala General Hospital, an incident occurred that subsequently had a negative impact on the young woman's funeral rituals. During the procession, one young woman, who was cross-dressing, stepped out of the line and came closer to the coffin, which was open to enable family members and friends to pay their last respects to their loved one. At the sight of the inert body of her lover, she started to weep with emotion. In her laments she called the deceased her 'amour' (lover) and reminded her of the promise they once made to each other: that they would never be parted. Outraged by what he had just heard from the young mourner, the disgruntled father ordered the cessation of the ceremony. In his anger he declared: T consider that I no longer have a child and I don't want to mourn homosexuals in my house. Go and do this somewhere else and not in my house.' Before he left the mortuary, the man threatened to use violence against anyone who dared bring the dead body of his daughter to his house. Later, 1 learned that there were no funeral vigils in the family home: the deceased woman was buried on the same day in the cemetery of the Bois des Singes and not in her native village, as initially planned. No member of the family deemed it necessary to accompany the deceased to her final resting place. 
		 The comments that followed this family drama proved to be crucial because they revealed a new twist in the local imagination of queemess with respect to a philosophy of life. An older woman apparently connected to the bereaved family did not hesitate in accusing the deceased young woman of having 'killed' her entire family even before her own physical death. 'This girl was really wicked, despite her deceptive appearances,' she said. She then asked: 'How can you be a homosexual when you know that you're the only child of your parents and that they are expecting you to give them children to expand the family?' In line with her friend's statements, another woman made these comments: 'Poor family. I really feel sorry for this family. I'm sure this family lineage will disappear forever when the man and his wife die. Who'll talk about this family again since there are no descendants to keep alive the memory of the family?' And then she added: 
		 
  If at least she had had a child before she died, she might have
  been forgiven for her homosexuality. It is for that child that
  people would mourn her. In our society, we don't just mourn the
  person who died; we also mourn on behalf of the children she left
  behind. These are the consequences of the homosexuality that white
  people teach our young people today through their films where one
  can see people of the same sex making love.
  
		 The woman's comments inspired this philosophical reflection on the part of the only man in the group: 'People must understand that the family is first of all the offspring [descendance], and without descendants there is no family.' 
		 The different cases described above underscore a phenomenon that is still understudied in African anthropology and queer studies: namely the desacralization and de-ritualization of the deaths of people identified as 'homosexuals', and of people with no descendance or progeny in contemporary Cameroonian society. Childless homosexuals whose dead bodies are treated with indifference by the general public, including by their family members, who are dehumanized, buried without dignity, dumped into communal graves like mad dogs, deprived of the right to a funeral, and de-ritualized in such a trivial manner, recall the dramatic fate of the figure Giorgio Agamben called homo sacer. Although the collective mistreatment of the dead bodies of people identified as 'homosexual' might not necessarily relate to the kind of biopolitics discussed by the Italian philosopher, it reveals a certain mode of representation of homoeroticism and queer identity by nativist and pro-natalist ideologies that celebrate a procreative sexual life, while dismissing a homoerotic form of life as anti-life. These principles of procreation and reproduction generally inscribe homoerotic forms of life in a register of cannibalistic eroticism. (7) According to these norms, socially disavowed sexual practices such as homoeroticism not only 'eat', devour or consume life, as often happens in cannibalistic witchcraft-related practices; they also undermine the fundamental principles of the reproduction and regeneration of life that allow society to withstand tragedy and loss. 
		 In other respects, the cases described above indicate that what I have previously referred to as 'bare death' or the ungrievable loss of persons identified as homosexual subjects appears as a logical consequence of their homosexual life, which had been represented as 'bare life', to borrow Agamben's term. In her Frames of War, Butler argues that the grievability of death is inseparable from the value we attach to certain lives, and that lives which were already framed as dispensable cannot be mourned or grieved (Butler 2009). In other words, there is always a connection between 'bare life' and 'bare death', as the cases of 'unreproductive' homosexual subjects show (see also Butler 2004). 
		 This idea of 'bare life' or 'bare death' is reflected in the comments made by some internet users following the death of a well-known homosexual jetsetter from Yaounde. On social media, his death provoked only disparaging and homophobic comments, such as: 'un petle (le moins, c'est toujours une bonne nouvelle pour le pays [one less faggot is always good news for the country]', 'la pederastie en deuil [pederasty in mourning]', 'au moins son sale derriere va se reposer en paix en enfer [at least his dirty backside will rest in peace in hell]', 'qu'il aille au diable dejci sa vie nous servait a quoi a la societe [may he go to hell! What was his life useful for to society]'!' and 'il est mort comme il a vecu: une vie inutile que personne ne regrettera [he died as he lived: a useless life that no one will regret]'. 
		 Homosexual, homo sacer and vitalis moralis 
		 One fine morning, I was listening to a popular talk show on a local radio station in Douala when one of the guests, Dr Abdelaziz, who was introduced as an anthropologist, philosopher and traditional doctor, made these statements: 
		 
  One of the reasons why we should strongly condemn homosexuality in
  our society is that it is an unreproductive sexuality and a waste
  of sexual energy and force. Homosexual people don't make children
  because it is impossible for two men or two women who sleep
  together to procreate. Even God himself cannot make that miracle.
  As Africans, we all know that life without children has no future,
  because when you pass, nobody will be there to mourn you. Nobody
  will remember you. We also make children not only to take care of
  us when we get old, but also because it is a guarantee for a good
  mourning [bon deuil).
  
		 And he continued: 'To live without producing offspring is to decide to be like a tree that cannot bear fruit, and in our societies we are not affected when such a tree falls down.' 
		 Dr Abdelaziz was expressing in plain language an opinion that now permeates contemporary Cameroonian society: namely, the idea that homosexuality is an unproductive and infertile sexuality, which, unlike heterosexual eroticism, does not permit the perpetuation of human life and the human species. Indeed, in the wake of the sexual biopolitics of the Cameroon government, with its eminently confrontational and violent responses to homosexual subjects, new sexual ideologies emerged around 2006 to which little attention has yet been given: these can be described as procreationist ideologies. (8) Beyond their epistemological and 8 methodological divergences, these nativist discourses all endorse a certain 'ethics of life' to which homosexuality, often perceived as an immoderata carnispetulantia (an immoderate carnal obsession), would be opposed. According to these philosophies that have entangled homosexual eroticism within registers of infertility and childlessness, homosexuality undermines Africa's reproductive and procreative power, its demographic vitality, and the development of its human capital. It is alleged that African subjects engaging in same-sex acts voluntarily or involuntarily renounce the historical mission that champions of natalism might have assigned to all African men and women: to contribute to the maintenance of the continent's population growth, and to what one Cameroonian analyst calls the 'preservation of the human being and its species over time' (Ayissi 2009: 162). 
		 Moreover, these pro-natalist ideologies present same-sex sexuality as a new Malthusian device deployed by the Western world to curb the growth of the African population. In many African countries, and especially in Cameroon, the subject identified as 'homosexual' now embodies the detestable figure of a traitor to the nation, an agent or a surrogate of Western imperialist forces plotting against African countries whose demographic growth would be worrisome to Western powers. 
		 This vitalis moralis resonates in a text published in 2009 by the Cameroonian philosopher Lucien Ayissi under the title 'La logique hedonistique de 'homosexualite au regard de l'ethique de vie' ('The hedonistic logic of homosexuality with regard to the ethics of life'). The author's main argument can be summed up as follows: in its new imperialist project, the West has imported and imposed on Africa a hedonistic pederasty, with the absolute purpose of sexual and carnal enjoyment. This is what Ayissi refers to as 'hedonophilia'--a form of sexuality that is guided primarily and essentially by a pathological passion for the pleasures of the flesh and enjoyment (jouissance). According to Ayissi, this libertine homosexual hedonism differs fundamentally from the spiritual homophilia that prevailed in ancient Greece and that had an essentially psychagogic function--that is, pedagogical and educational. Whereas the ancient form of pederasty celebrated by ancient philosophers such as Socrates and Plato primarily aimed at developing wisdom and virtue in the eromenos (the young male who was often the disciple or the learner) by the erastes (the adult male and also the master or initiator), the homosexual eroticism that currently thrives in Africa is exclusively motivated by aphrodisia or carnal pleasures. As the author points out: 
		 
  the reductive logic of the hedonism of homosexuality is, unlike the
  psychagogic and philosophical-spiritual homophilia of Socrates and
  Plato, lacking a relation to the ethics of life. The ethics of
  pleasure that underlie this logic are part of a utilitarianism and
  consumerism that consist of moralizing carnal pleasure and
  absolutizing it, in oblivion of the preservation of human life and
  species. The problem with the hedonistic logic of homosexuality is
  that it cannot provide appropriate answers to the metaphysical
  question related to our conatus. (Ayissi 2009: 162, my translation)
  
		 Lucien Ayissi adopts an adversarial and vindictive stance in relation to homosexual eroticism, which he accuses of cultivating vile and beastly sexual behaviours in Africans. The Cameroonian philosopher also denounces current homosexual practices, which, according to him, are characterized by their 'predilection for evanescent and ambiguous pleasures' (Ayissi 2009: 163): 'In terms of the ethics of life, homosexuality is discredited because it gives sexual pleasure the excessive visibility it does not deserve. It greatly devalues the body by reducing it to the mundane function of aphrodisiac manufacture' (ibid.). According to Ayissi, the outrageous sublimation of aphrodisia that he observes in homosexual relations is equivalent to what he finds in postmodern societies of the Western world. 
		 Ayissi's insistence on the need to maintain human reproduction and to preserve life in human sexual relations suggests that a certain African nativist philosophy primarily dismisses homosexual eroticism because of the 'disregard of homosexuality for life in favour of carnal pleasures and its eventual systematization [which] can deal a fatal blow to the human species', as he points out (Ayissi 2009: 167). He rejects homosexual eroticism because it encourages what he calls the 'subordination of life in search of a moralized and absolutized carnal pleasure' (ibid.). 
		 Ayissi's comments also suggest that homosexuality is vilified by a certain nativist discourse because it amounts to an 'upheaval of the law of the living [loi du vivant]', as Georges Balandier would put it (1984). Moreover, homosexual hedonism is dismissed as a dangerous sexual practice and orientation because it allegedly replaces this hi du vivant with that of unproductiveness and infertility. Adepts of homosexual eroticism allegedly have the propensity to give preference to sexual pleasure over procreation, or to favour aphrodisia over vita. In Cameroon, where new nativist discourses have made demography, and especially what Lee Edelman calls 'procreative futurism' (Edelman 2004), a powerful weapon against the so-called Western imperialist project, sexual practices that do not produce children are generally perceived badly. This is the case with same-sex sexuality, which tends to be associated with death, decline and chaos. 
		 Ayissi's text offers a hedono-thanatological (9) understanding of homosexual desire. It represents homosexuality as a form of eroticism that is guided by two contradictory primordial 'impulses'. The first is jouissance, which is driven by the frantic and limitless search for carnal pleasure. Homosexual hedonism allegedly transforms the African homosexual subject into a desirable body that is said to place (homo)sexual consumerism in the pantheon of his or her priorities. This discourse represents the homosexual individual not only as a lecherous subject with unbridled and unrestrained sexuality, but also as a 'pleasure machine' (machine a plaisir) driven only by sexual appetites. The second impulse is the desire for death that allegedly characterizes the current libertine homoeroticism. The urge towards death often finds expression in the unnecessary spending and sterile debauchery of sexual energy that is considered the main characteristic of homosexual relationality. 
		 This problematization of same-sex desires by the new nativist and procreationist discourses partly explains why, in contemporary Central African societies dominated by a cult and even a fetishization of natality (10) and procreation, any individual or group of people engaged in unreproductive sexuality are seen as a threat to society or the community at large. Moreover, the recriminatory idea of same-sex desires expressed in these discourses explains why some homosexual people in present-day Cameroon have become what was referred to earlier as homines sacri. Reflecting on Ayissi's interpretation of homosexual hedonism, it is tempting to characterize the current African homo sacer as a non-conforming African subject who is socially ostracized, culturally alienated, and politically and legally persecuted because of his or her refusal to inscribe his or her sexuality in a moral economy of procreation and reproduction. 
		 Lee Edelman's argument that queer people in the Western world are often profiled as subjects with a 'relentlessly narcissistic, antisocial, and future-negating drive', because they are supposedly not ready to surrender their sexual freedom to the conservative ideology of 'procreative and reproductive futurism' (Edelman 2004), also applies to many people from Central Africa identifying as homosexual. The cases alluded to here show that these subjects were denied proper funerals when they passed away, because, during their lifetime, they had rejected what Edelman would call the 'rhetoric of future' (ibid.): they challenged the dominant social, cultural and political order that makes the phallus and the vagina of Africans powerful instruments for the achievement of an African demographic future. Moreover, childless and non-procreative homosexual subjects were viewed as sexually non-conforming subjects compromising the celebrated new African generation. In short, with these young same-sex loving men and women, African demography was seen to have no future. That is why their deaths were framed as irrelevant or met with responses such as 'good riddance'. 
		 Conclusion 
		 In her ground-breaking study of the economically disadvantaged sugarcane workers in Brazil's rural Nordeste State, Nancy Scheper-Hughes argues that, because of the high rate of infant mortality, destitute mothers have ceased to mourn their dying children and have developed an uncomplaining attitude towards death. Their familiarity with tragedy has contributed to them hardening their hearts and drying their eyes (Scheper-Hughes 1992). A similar stoical and indifferent attitude towards death has been observed among the Meru from the northern region of Tanzania. Indeed, according to Liv Haram, repeated deaths and frequent funerals are often framed as a 'waste of money and time'. This is partly due to the fact that local populations are 'tired of mourning' and 'can no longer mourn honestly' (Haram 2013: 223), as one of her informants put it. 
		 While both studies point to the pervasiveness of death and mortality as the main cause of people's insensibility to bereavement in these societies, this article focuses on the deceased's non-conforming sexual identity--or, more precisely, their status as infertile homosexuals--which causes their kin relatives or family members to refrain from grieving for them, or which makes their death bearable. Unproductive homosexuality has become a critical social factor in understanding the substantial change in postcolonial African regimes of mourning, and especially the de-socialization and de-ritualization of the deaths of specific individuals or social groups in contemporary Cameroon. 
		 Moreover, this article has demonstrated that homophobic and pro-natalist ideologies that have taken a more radical form in Cameroon over the past decade have transformed childless homosexual persons into homines sacri whose lives and deaths are worthless or do not matter. These extremist anti-homosexual sentiments have excluded both the lives and the deaths of same-sex loving men and women from a meaningful social existence, by turning them into either a 'bare life' or a 'bare death'. For the same reason, these sexual outcasts are not buried in a proper and respectful manner, which, according to many African traditions and customs, generally means being buried in the land of one's ancestors by close relatives or family members.

<titre>RUGBY-UNION-CHAMPIONS-RAC-SAR/ (UPDATE 2) UPDATE 2-Rugby-Racing strike late to dump holders Saracens out of Champions Cup</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters)  
		 (Adds quote, result of second semi-final) 
		 PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Racing 92's Juan Imhoff capped a flowing break to score the only try in the dying minutes as they came from behind to beat holders Saracens 19-15 in their European Champions Cup semi-final at <meronyme id="1732">the Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> on Saturday. 
		 The win sent Racing, runners-up in 2016 and 2018, into the showpiece match at the expense of the three time champions where they will face Exeter Chiefs, who beat four-times winners Toulouse 28-12 to reach their first final.
		"In many ways it's the end of an era," said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall, whose side will be relegated to the second-tier at the end of the season for breaching salary cap rules and will not compete in Europe next year. 
		 Teddy Iribaren scored three first-half penalties to send Racing into the break with a 9-6 lead but Saracens turned up the heat after the restart via the boot of Alex Goode, who ended the match with five successful penalty kicks of his own. 
		 Saracens made a bright start to the second period, dominating the scrum and putting Racing under pressure with their kicking game. 
		 Goode, filling in at flyhalf for the suspended Owen Farrell as he did in Saracens' thrilling quarter-final win over Leinster, gave his team a six-point lead with three penalty kicks, but Saracens lost Brad Barritt to a head injury just after the hour. 
		 The captain's departure proved a bitter blow for Saracens, who had already lost half the team that took them to the title last season. 
		 Substitute Maxime Machenaud had pulled Racing back to within three points with a penalty as Saracens were forced to reshuffle their pack before a moment of brilliance from Finn Russell sparked the game's decisive moment. 
		 Russell found Virimi Vakatawa with a delicate chip over the Saracens midfield and the New Zealand-born centre powered into space before offloading back to the Racing flyhalf, who released Imhoff to cross with three minutes left on the clock. 
		 Machenaud made no mistake with the conversion, shredding Saracens' dreams of European glory. (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Clare Fallon)

		ENPNewswire-October 23, 2020--University of Exeter: Former rebel groups become more moderate after gaining political power in nations with democracy, research shows 
		 (C)2020 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 22102020 - Former rebel groups who transform into political parties have adopted a moderate stance after gaining power in more democratic political systems, a study shows.
		In contrast, the tactics and policies of the former rebel groups remained unchanged if the issue which attracted supporters to them continued to remain. This is exacerbated in nations where there is a tradition of solving conflict outside of formal politics, often in a violent manner, according to the research. 
		 The analysis of the former rebel groups, from Africa, the Balkans, Asia and Latin America, shows how the political environment at the time of the transformation of former rebel groups into political parties, and the timing of their of electoral victory, shapes how these formerly excluded parties behave once in power. 
		 In countries with a legacy of one-party systems, the former rebel groups have been the least moderate, while post-rebel parties entering political systems with a tradition of competitive electoral politics have been comparatively more moderate as their power has been limited by opposition parties, most notably at the time of the first elections held after the conflict 
		 In countries where power is rooted in the use of force - often combined with patronage - the groups eventually also used such methods to maintain power - if not already doing so - mimicking the environment they entered. 
		 The research, by Dr Lise Storm from the University of Exeter, is published in the Open Journal of Political Science. 
		 Dr Storm said: 'Post-rebel parties who can no longer rely upon garnering support on the basis of the issues which drove their popularity during conflict are more likely to behave inclusively once in power and remain moderate in the longer term. 
		 'Where the issue which attracted voters to them remained, parties were less likely to moderate as there was not much of an incentive for them to change. Where the importance of the issue driving support disappeared, the former rebel groups became more moderate in order to attract voters and win power.' 
		 Some of the groups examined still had an armed wing and some also had not renounced the use of violence. They had obtained government power via the electoral process, and some operated both as political movements and militant groups. 
		 Dr Storm used qualitative data showing electoral success for 12 parties: the African National Congress in South Africa, the Conseil National pour la Defense de la Democratie in Burundi, the Communist Party of Nepal, the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional in El Salvador, the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor-Leste in East Timor, the Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica in Croatia, the Mouvement Patriotique du Salut in Chad , the National Resistance Movement in Uganda, the Parti Congolais du Travail in Congo Brazzaville, the Partia Demokratike e Kosoves in Kosovo, the Parti du Peuple pour la Reconstruction et la Democratie in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Front Patriotique Rwandais (Inkotanyi ) in Rwanda. 
		 Dr Storm said: 'These findings have important implications for research into the inclusion of Islamist parties into formal politics and the debate on whether such parties are likely to moderate. The evidence from the experiences of the post-rebel parties in power, which share a similar background to the Islamist, shows that the issue is not one of whether such parties should be included or excluded from political participation, but rather how to best create an environment that facilitates Islamist moderation. 
		 'Exclusionary authoritarian contexts breed immoderate post-rebel parties in power, whereas more inclusive, competitive regimes that rely on elections as a means to solve conflict facilitate more moderate behaviour amongst former rebel parties once in national government.'

<titre>SOCGEN-STRATEGY/ (FOCUS, PIX) FOCUS-Risk haunts Societe Generale's Oudea in elusive hunt for growth</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 PARIS, Oct 7 (Reuters) By Maya Nikolaeva  
		 By Maya Nikolaeva 
		 PARIS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Frederic Oudea promised Societe Generale investors "growth with lower risk" after he became chief executive in 2008, the year a rogue trader lost billions in equity derivatives and brought the French bank close to collapse. 
		 Fast forward a decade and SocGen's share price is at a record low and the bank's market capitalisation 78% lower than where it was when Oudea took over, after losses on complex investment products wiped out equity trading revenue in the first and second quarters of 2020.
		"The current valuation of SocGen makes no sense," Oudea, whose term expires in 2023, told Reuters. 
		 The bank's share price, which closed up 6.7% at 12.2 euros on Tuesday, gives it a market capitalisation of about 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion), around a quarter of that of rival BNP Paribas and half that of Credit Agricole. 
		 Oudea has responded to the latest set-back by overhauling the top management at France's third-largest largest bank and is once again focused on delivering lower risk growth. 
		 The 57-year-old Parisian says that a revamped markets unit, coupled with an end to the European Central Bank's ban on dividend payments, which limits how banks can reward their shareholders, and a restructuring of SocGen's retail business can reverse the situation. 
		 "The situation should be very different in three or four quarters," Oudea, who is the longest-serving current CEO of a major European bank, said during a meeting at <meronyme id="1734">SocGen's modernist twin tower offices</meronyme> in <mention id="1735">the La Defense district of Paris</mention>. 
		 "We have recently confirmed our guidance to deliver improved performances in the second half, in particular regarding our equity business, and have launched a promising study to create a new leading retail bank in France," he said. 
		 In 2010, Oudea said lowering risk meant "significantly reducing market risk" and strengthening its risk department. He has since succeeded in bringing down SocGen's Value at Risk (VaR), a measure of its trading exposures or a maximum amount of daily losses that could happen with a 99% probability. 
		 But while SocGen filings show its quarterly VaR fell to 23 million euros on average in 2019, from 25 million in 2013 and 35 million in 2010, this year's blow-out has left some investors and analysts uncertain whether Oudea is near to finishing the job. 
		 "The two recent quarters were a vivid example that their business model is probably not as balanced or stable as they wanted it to be," Olivier Panis, credit rating analyst at Moody's, said of SocGen's recent results. 
		 Oudea has spent much of his tenure trying to make earnings at the investment bank and group levels less reliant on selling investors complex structured products linked to equities. 
		 But tighter capital rules made growth in other areas like fixed income difficult, with equity derivatives remaining the one niche it commanded a sizeable market share in. 
		 "They had a problem with structured products in Q2, but it was not compensated by the rest of the investment bank. That made a big contrast with other French banks' results," Guillaume Brisset, a partner and a fund manager at Clartan Associés which holds SocGen shares, said. 
		 Equity trading accounted for 29% of SocGen's investment bank revenue in 2019, and for 10% of the group's overall revenue. This compared with 17% of investment bank revenue and for 5% of group revenue at French rival BNP for the same year. 
		 SocGen's equity trading revenue fell by 80% in the second quarter and was almost completely wiped out in the first, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, the only two banks with bigger equity derivatives franchises according to Coalition data, both saw equity earnings surge. 
		 But UBS analysts expect SocGen's equity trading revenue to rise by 20% in the third quarter, outperforming all of its peers, including BNP, JP Morgan and Goldman. 
		 "Volatility remained elevated but without major spikes, typically a constructive environment for derivatives trading" UBS said in a note, adding that its top picks are Barclays and BNP, with SocGen its "least preferred" bank for European CIB (corporate and investment banking). 
		 LOWER RISK REWARD? 
		 With limited chances of making traction in other areas of trading, Oudea is not planning to scale back equity derivatives. Instead he wants to sell the same amount of products in terms of billions of euros, but to focus on ones which carry less risk. 
		 This means fewer of the products bearing exotic names that lost SocGen millions when companies canceled dividends and stock prices tanked during the market sell-off in March. 
		 SocGen will now offer alternative products where risks are easier to manage, but yields for investors will be lower. 
		 "So we have already designed new products where ... we don't have this dividend risk," Oudea said during a banking conference last month, adding: "We will go probably for more single-asset products than products with correlation." 
		 De-risking will only address part of the challenge which Oudea faces in his remaining years as CEO. 
		 Oudea, who has been at the bank for 25 years, is credited with shoring up the capital base, its Achilles' heel after the 2008 crisis, and selling some non-core businesses. 
		 Sources have also told Reuters that SocGen is gearing up for a sale of its asset management business Lyxor in a bid to cut costs. SocGen declined to comment on this. 
		 While further asset sales and French retail restructuring will help on costs, they will do less to improve profit growth and scale and Oudea has said he would only take part in major deals as a buyer as European banking prepares for expected consolidation. 
		 However, some investors say SocGen's options look limited. 
		 "It is somewhat stuck because it is too small and has therefore no room for maneuver. Many of its activities are of a sub-optimal size," Brisset at Clartan Associés said.

<titre>Janus-faced activists: the social and political embeddedness of civil society in Niger.</titre>
<auteur>JANNIK SCHRITT</auteur>
<texte>
		10.1017/S0001972019001086 This article discusses the workings of civil society and its leaders in Niger. Tracing the country's historically sedimented socio-political order, it argues that Niger's civil society is characterized by a twofold embeddedness. Since the introduction of multiparty politics in 1990, the political game in Niger has been exemplified by co-optation, bribery and corruption. These spoils are a central focus for civil society leaders who have become experienced in the political game. Indeed, actors' social embeddedness in networks of solidarity demands that they capture and redistribute the spoils they receive. At the same time, however, their social and political legitimacy as civil society leaders rests on their ability to avoid becoming entangled in the game, and to avoid accusations of 'playing politics'. In other words, civil society activists are embedded in the same social and political structures as state bureaucrats and politicians. In this context, civil society activists cannot maintain the moral high ground they often claim to occupy. Cet article traite du fonctionnement de la societe civile et de ses leaders au Niger. Decrivant l'ordre sociopolitique historiquement sedimente du pays, il soutient que la societe civile du Niger est caracterisee par un double ancrage. Depuis l'introduction de la politique multipartite en 1990, le jeu politique au Niger a ete exemplifie par la cooptation et la corruption. Ces dernieres sont une cible centrale des leaders de la societe civile qui sont devenus rodes au jeu politique. En effet, l'ancrage social des acteurs dans les reseaux de solidarite exige qu'ils s'emparent des fruits qu'ils recoivent et les redistribuent. En meme temps, cependant, leur legitimite sociale et politique en tant que leaders de la societe civile repose sur leur aptitude a eviter de se meler au jeu et de se faire accuser de " faire de la politique ". En d'autres termes, les activistes de la societe civile sont ancres dans les memes structures sociales et politiques que les bureaucrates de l'Etat et les politiciens. Dans ce contexte, les activistes de la societe civile ne peuvent pas maintenir la position morale elevee qu'ils pretendent souvent occuper.
		Introduction 
		 On 28 November 2011, the first oil refinery in Niger was inaugurated in the country's south-east, not far from its second-largest city, Zinder. Several weeks prior to the inauguration, a small group of activists had created a new civil society committee, the Comite Regional des Associations et Syndicats de la Region de Zinder (CRAS). CRAS was a vocal critic of the government, accusing it of bad governance, corruption and marginalizing the region of Zinder with regard to possible oil benefits. The committee continued to criticize the new government which had come to power under President Mahamadou Issoufou in April that year--until a conflict in which two leading committee members were accused of failing to redistribute bribes led to its disintegration several months later. 
		 Situating this article in the literature on African politics and the state, I discuss the workings of civil society and its leaders in Niger. (1) To do so, I trace the historical sedimentation of colonial and postcolonial practices and experiences into a fragmented political and socio-cultural order (Bierschenk 2014). An analysis of the processual development from colonial times to the newly introduced 'rules of the game' with the transition to a multiparty system in the early 1990s shows how civil society leaders have made co-optation, bribery and corruption into anticipated spoils in their political game. At the same time, civil society activists are embedded in society's social norms, which are characterized by negotiation, gift giving, solidarity, predatory authority and redistributive accumulation within social networks (Olivier de Sardan 1999). Moreover, exacerbated by structural adjustment programmes and the absence of a welfare state in Niger, large parts of society find themselves living in a precarious state. In these conditions, 'getting along' (se debrouiller) is often tied to financial flows, positions and jobs found in the political sphere, which afford some of the few opportunities for securing an income (Lavigne Delville 2015) and thus for sustaining one's personal networks of solidarity and survival. This social embeddedness results in implicit or tacit 'practical norms' and a 'game of the rules' (De Herdt and Olivier de Sardan 2015). 
		 A perspective on both the historical sedimentation of the socio-political order and the entanglement of socio-political logics is important to understand the workings of civil society in Niger. I argue that civil society in Niger is characterized by both a social and a political embeddedness. Here, a two-sided logic emerges: while, on the one hand, civil society activists have the moral obligation to redistribute spoils among members of their social networks and even to capture the spoils in the first place, on the other hand, those outside their personal networks cry foul over them 'playing politics' and thus question their social and political legitimacy. Civil society engagement in Niger is thus characterized by 'normative double-binds' (Bierschenk 2014) that tie actors to official norms such as responsibility, transparency and democratic values, and to social norms including gift giving, solidarity and redistributive accumulation. In this context, civil society activists cannot maintain the moral high ground they often claim to occupy. 
		 This article is based on research conducted over thirteen months during multiple fieldwork stays and at multiple sites between 2011 and 2014. In-depth ethnographic data on Niger's civil society was collected by participant observation on the civil society committee CRAS in Zinder over a period of about five months, from CRAS's foundation in November 2011 to its disintegration in March 2012. As an associated committee member, I recorded and analysed CRAS's meetings and participated in its political activities. Following Bierschenk and Olivier de Sardan's (2014) proposal to analyse the concrete practices of bureaucracies and bureaucrats in 'doing the state' and how these practices are interwoven with representations of 'seeing the state', my participant observation helped me reveal not only the discrepancy between what civil society activists say and how they act, but also the tacit knowledge inherent in their practice. I will show how, in their self-representations, Nigerien civil society activists have taken up the moral language of democratic counter-powers against a seemingly corrupt African state. However, the corruption case on the CRAS committee, on which I was a participant observer, reveals that civil society organizations are prone to the same patterns of embezzlement, bribery and co-optation as politicians and other state bureaucrats. Moreover, within the methodological framework of the extended case method (see, for example, van Velsen 1967), researching the committee's meetings and contextualizing my participant observation within historical developments and the national politics of the country helped me decode the social and political logic of Niger more generally. 
		 To make my argument, I start by briefly reviewing the literature on civil society in Africa. I then historicize civil society engagement in Niger before I delve into the activities of CRAS around the oil refinery's inauguration. Finally, I elaborate on my understanding of the social and political embeddedness of civil society in Niger. 
		 Civil society in Africa 
		 With the end of the Cold War and the subsequent political changes in Eastern Europe, the concept of civil society not only became popular in good governance policies all around the globe but was also demanded by internal forces for political liberalization. Commonly viewed from a liberal perspective at the time, civil society was understood as being central to democratization. A glance over the literature from the time suffices to see that numerous studies celebrated civil society as a new tool for democratization processes and emancipatory politics in the global South. Many of these studies were highly normative regarding civil society activists as drivers for democratic change who occupied a higher moral ground than politicians and state bureaucrats. This concept of civil society, however, has come under increasing scrutiny. 
		 The concept of civil society as a realm separated from the state is an ideal deeply rooted in European political thought and is therefore profoundly Eurocentric (Hann and Dunn 1996). Numerous studies celebrating civil society as a democratizing force are both simplistic and problematic, as they entail both Eurocentric and evolutionist thinking that typically assumes a linear development based on observations of European history--a form of thinking that Mamdani (1995: 608) criticized as 'history by analogy'. However, African states have not necessarily followed this linear pattern of highly idealized European development. Moreover, this ideal civil society is not the reality in Europe either, where an empowering state is required for an active and powerful civil society (Levy 1999). In short, the idealized Eurocentric dichotomy between the state and civil society cannot simply be transferred to African contexts. This dichotomy's normative and moral framework involves misleading positive connotations of political progress, legitimate grievances and a better social order (Mamdani 1995). Instead, the workings of civil society cannot be understood without focusing on the complex and dynamic relationship between state and society in Africa (and elsewhere) (Bayart 1986). 
		 Looking at the state-society relationship in Africa, the literature can be grouped into 'introverted' and 'extraverted' perspectives. Looking from an 'introverted' perspective, the neopatrimonial state model (Medard 1982), which has become a kind of catch-all concept, describes the conflation of patrimonial informal logics and formal legal-rational bureaucratic logics in political administration. The prime reason for this conflation is typically understood as internal, lying in traditional elements of African societies or a somewhat opaque notion of 'culture' (see especially Chabal and Daloz 1999). On the other hand, rather than focusing on internal culture as an or the explanatory variable, theorists such as Bayart (2000) look at Africa's history of 'extraversion' in the world, seeing the continent's insertion in the international economy as the most important factor in explaining social inequalities, clientelism and corruption. Building on Bayart's notion of extraversion, Pommerolle (2010) has argued that civil society in Africa has to be seen as an agent both of emancipation and of domination, navigating a tight political space under constraints. From a Gramscian perspective in particular, civil society (in Africa) is not seen as a force for challenging the status quo and engaging in progressive politics, but often rather for relaying the interests of Western donors and thereby maintaining the status quo by building societal consensus (Hearn 2001). Such a perspective, however, neglects the 'introverted' civil society associations that often engage in public political disputes, and overemphasizes 'extraverted' development or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which most often align with the agenda of their international donors. Nevertheless, the introverted/extraverted boundaries are not clear-cut but rather blurred and fluid, with some associations constantly switching between these positions or activists simultaneously leading both types of organization. Moreover, as civil society organizations are typically highly personalized, and some well-known figures head several different organizations, this article also focuses on key actors. 
		 Historicizing civil society in Niger 
		 As a former French colony, Niger experienced several anti-colonial as well as postcolonial struggles after independence in 1960. The postcolonial constitution of 1960 first provided for a multiparty system, with two large unions emerging: the student union Union des Scolaires Nigeriens (USN), and the workers' union Union Nationale des Travailleurs du Niger (in 1978 it was renamed Union des Syndicats des Travailleurs du Niger (USTN)). However, through the elimination and co-optation of political opponents, Niger--with the help of France, which was interested in the country's uranium deposits--soon turned into an authoritarian regime (van Walraven 2009). Despite authoritarian rule and regular government attempts at co-optation, repression or material distribution, the unions, and the USN in particular, formed the nation's de facto political opposition, at least until 1983, when violent clashes left the movement paralyzed for several years (Smirnova 2019). 
		 The first ordinance specifying the regime of associations in Niger was introduced by Seyni Kountche's military regime. (2) Kountche came to power in 1974 after ousting Niger's first president, Hamani Diori (1960-74), in a military coup. Based on high uranium revenues (uranium production in the north of Niger had finally started in 1971), Kountche announced ambitious development goals in his new societe de developpement. In this new 'development society', two main 'civil society' organizations--a moderate Islamic organization and a national youth movement (Samariya)--were assigned an important role in disseminating the government programmes among the population and in forming a national identity (Robinson 1991). However, the restrictive character of the first ordinance did not allow for the existence of associations other than those promoted by the Kountche regime. 
		 When uranium prices fell in the early 1980s and high government spending led to a growing budget deficit, Niger was effectively forced to apply for its first loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1983. It was in this context that the regime of associations saw its first important modification in 1984, (3) allowing youth, school, sport, religious, cultural, foreign and charity associations. In 1986, Niger had to accept the first structural adjustment programmes (SAPs). 
		 The austerity measures imposed by the IMF' through the SAPs primarily hit the beneficiaries of the societe de developpement and led to growing tensions, which, in turn, threatened the stability of the regime (Gervais 1995). The state violently repressed strikes and demonstrations led by USN and USTN, and on 9 February 1990, three protestors were killed and several were seriously injured. The deaths were the last straw, and at the end of 1990, Ali Saibou (1987-90) who had taken over power following Kountche's death in 1987--was forced to allow the transition to a multiparty system and the holding of a National Conference. The reintroduction of a multiparty system changed power configurations in Niger. A number of new political parties emerged, of which the most important over the years came to be the Mouvement National de la Societe de Developpement (MNSD-Nassara), the Convention Democratique et Sociale (CDS-Rahama), the Parti Nigerien pour la Democratic et le Socialisme (PNDS-Tarayya) and, most recently, the Mouvement Democratique Nigerien pour une Federation Africaine (MODEN-FA Lumana Africa). In addition, with their participation in the National Conference, civil society organizations were recognized as legitimate countervailing powers to the state. Non-govemmental and human rights associations were formally introduced by law in May 1991. (4) With this law, civil society associations proliferated--over 1,000 formed in Niger between 1991 and 2015 (Tidjani Alou 2015: 138). However, most of these civil society associations have been relatively short-lived and today exist only on paper. After an initial phase of funding from international donors, the money was often embezzled, and the associations ceased to exist without continued sponsorship. 
		 The reintroduction of a multiparty system in Niger gave rise to a decade of experimentation and repeated breakdowns of the institutional order (Villalon and Idrissa 2005). Linder the new multiparty constitution, the state monopoly of radio and television had also been abandoned, guaranteeing the freedom and independence of the media. (5) After years of silence under authoritarian rule, an emerging civil society and private media thus enabled public debate. However, civil society has had an ambiguous role in the country's regime changes. Elischer (2013) shows how Niger's trade unions were largely driven by economic demands and have thus contributed to both 'autocratic' and 'democratic' breakdowns of power since the early 1990s. The unions did not want to pay the costs of austerity measures enforced under the SAP and thus sought to delegitimize and paralyze Niger's Third Republic under Mahamane Ousmane from CDS-Rahama (1993-96). Then, in the immediate wake of the violent military coup in 1996, they remained subdued (Adji 2012). However, when they were excluded from Colonel Ibrahim Bare Mainassara's new military regime in 1996, they started a series of general strikes that in turn led the regime to encourage the formation of a rival union, the Confederation Nigerienne du Travail (CNT). When Bare was assassinated in 1999, Major Daouda Malam Wanke became head of state. That year, Wanke gave way to a democratically elected government, and Mamadou Tandja from MNSD-Nassara became president. With debt-relief programmes, a new influx of development aid and no real accountability system in place, Tandja was able to increase civil service salaries and to buy social peace for several years. 
		 After a long period of silence from civil society, in 2005 the Coalition Equite, Qualite et Lutte contre la Vie Chere 'reinjected politics into public life' (Tidjani Alou 2007) by protesting against an increase in value-added tax (VAT) from 15 to 19 per cent. Focusing on the increase in VAT and rising food prices, the civil society coalition organized highly successful demonstrations, general strikes and 'ghost town' operations in the country's major cities (Maccatory et al. 2010). On 15 March 2005, 100,000 to 150,000 people are said to have participated in a demonstration in the capital, Niamey. The movement had become a genuine threat to the stability of the government. When the coalition called for further public demonstrations, the Tandja government arrested the five leading activists --Marou Amadou, Nouhou Arzika, Kassoum lssa, Moustafa Kadi and Moussa Tchangari (6)--on charges of threatening the security of the state and organizing illegal assemblies. 
		 After the arrests, the government started negotiations with the coalition leaders. With newly gained financial leverage through external funding, especially development aid, Tandja was able to acquiesce to many of the protestors' demands, including the withdrawal of the increase in VAT (except for sugar), with the loss of government revenue to be made up through increases in business and property taxes. To collect these taxes, the Tandja government founded the Comite d'Appui aux Services d'Assiette et de Recouvrement des Taxes et Impots Fonciers (CASARIF). The coalition was invited to propose six members for the committee, an invitation that created division among its leaders. Whereas Moussa Tchangari remained publicly opposed to the idea of civil society entering governmental committees, Marou Amadou became its vice-coordinator. This is a typical example of how co-optation works in the Nigerien context, with governmental committees being created to include civil society members. As committee members, the activists then receive privileges and financial benefits such as daily and travel allowances or food and drinks. In co-opting civil society activists into governmental decision making and by using public funds or intimidation to quell political opposition, Tandja was able not only to create division between the activists, thereby weakening civil society as a whole and thus maintaining a social peace, but also to pursue his political projects over the years to come. 
		 First, in February 2007, the Tuareg rebel group Mouvement des Nigeriens pour la Justice (MNJ) launched attacks on the Nigerien military and French parastatal uranium company AREVA, justifying them as protests against both foreign exploitation of uranium and regional marginalization from the government in Niamey. Against the background of the US War on Terror, Tandja's government classified the MNJ as a terrorist group. This move received support from some civil society activists, especially Nouhou Arzika's Mouvement Patriotique, which argued against diplomatic efforts and for a military solution to put down the rebels. Second, after having concluded an oil contract with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in June 2008, a cornerstone ceremony for the refinery in Zinder was held on 27 October 2008. President Tandja used the ceremony to launch his campaign for constitutional change, tazarce or 'Continuation'. Under tazarce, the regime would go from semi-presidential to presidential, the president would be allowed an extra three-year transitional term, and, after that, he would then be eligible to stand for re-election. An impressive crowd had been mobilized to welcome Tandja at the ceremony in Zinder. In his speech, the Zinder governor at the time, Yahaya Yandaka, asked the president, in the name of the Nigerien population, to complete the 'great construction sites' that he had initiated, especially those that were making Niger an oil producer. 
		 To make the strategically fabricated 'will of the population' for him to remain in office a public fact, Tandja co-opted popular civil society associations and labour unions to support tazarce (Abdoul Azizou 2010). Nouhou Arzika's Mouvement Patriotique and Dan Dubai's Mouvement Populaire pour la Perennisation des Actions du Developpement (MPPAD) became the leading lobbyists for tazarce, and together with other actors from politics and civil society such as the USN, they formed a national 'tazarce committee'. In return for their support, Tandja gave these civil society activists seats on various governmental bodies. However, a number of other civil society organizations joined the political opposition around Mahamadou Issoufou from the PNDS-Tarayya in vocally opposing tazarce. In December 2008, Marou Amadou's CROISADE and several other civil society associations and labour unions formed the Front Uni pour la Sauvegarde des Acquis Democratiques (FUSAD) to combat any attempts at constitutional change. They later joined with the political opposition to form a 'movement for democracy', the Coordination des Forces pour la Democratic et la Republique (CFDR). The CFDR openly called for international sanctions and even a military coup against the Tandja regime. 
		 To understand how Tandja was able to co-opt certain civil society organizations, and not others, we need to look at these groups' political and ideological affiliations, and at their sources of funding. At the time when Tandja was seeking supporters for tazarce, Nouhou Arzika's Mouvement Patriotique was the only one of the five major activists' associations that had no significant international donors, thus remaining 'introverted'. As such, it was able and willing to join tazarce, especially as the campaign's patriotic and anti-imperial rhetoric following Tandja's turn towards China fit well with its image. Although Moussa Tchangari's Alternative Espaces Citoyens' anti-imperialist and Pan-Africanist rhetoric was also similar to Tandja's, it was not viable or able to support the campaign due to both the group's extraverted partnership with the international anti-globalization movement and its close introverted relationship with Nigerien intellectuals who primarily supported the 'socialist' PNDS-Tarayya party. As such, Tchangari's organization refrained from taking a clear position on tazarce. Moustafa Kadi's extraverted CODDAE was prevented from actively intervening and declared itself neutral, as its main international donors, including the IMF, represent themselves as 'apolitical'. Kassoum Issa's introverted SNEN teachers' union also declared itself neutral. While Tandja had been able to quell or appease the unions and their members in 2005, SNEN retained a traditional closeness to the 'socialist' PNDS, which had been formed by student and teacher union activists in 1990. Finally, Marou Amadou's extraverted CROISADE became one of the major voices against tazarce, as his association was financially supported by international donors in the field of democracy promotion. (7) 
		 With international sanctions in place, Commander Salou Djibo overthrew Tandja in a military coup on 18 February 2010, saying that he wanted to make Niger an example of democracy and good governance. Under the new military regime, a 131-strong National Consultative Council was created to assist and instruct the transitional government. Although leading civil society activists had not been included in the transitional military government itself, they were assigned prominent positions by the military junta. Marou Amadou was appointed president of the council. Djibo organized new elections within a year. In March 2011, the former political opposition came to power, with Mahamadou Issoufou at the helm. Issoufou appointed Marou Amadou Minister of Justice--a role he used to jail several of his former colleagues and friends. While those civil society associations who had supported tazarce were consequently removed from governmental bodies, they were replaced by those who had supported Issoufou. The Issoufou government also created so many advisory positions for its supporters, especially university intellectuals, that it became a 'state of advisors' (Adji 2014: 370-2). The roles switched, with those civil society associations and intellectuals who had been vocal in criticizing the Tandja regime becoming mute, while those who had supported tazarce and consequently lost their positions in governmental bodies now becoming vocal critics of the new regime. 
		 It was in this social and political context that the oil refinery was inaugurated near Zinder in late 2011 and that CRAS emerged as a new civil society collective. 
		 CRAS and civil society in Zinder 
		 Dan Dubai's MPPAD, which had been a vocal supporter of tazarce and Tandja's oil project (Dubai was therefore widely regarded as the founding father of tazarce), was now the most vocal organization in criticizing the government and claiming that the Zinder region was being marginalized with regard to the possible benefits of oil. In the weeks prior to the oil refinery's inauguration, several other civil society leaders and organizations and labour unions from Zinder met to discuss working together on issues around oil. The initiative to establish a new civil society committee came from regional representatives of Nouhou Arzika's Mouvement Patriotique and his consumer organization OCRONI. After several initial meetings with just a handful of activists, they tried to assemble as many Zinder civil society associations as possible to create a new umbrella organization. This organization would become known as the Comite Regional des Associations et Syndicats de la Region de Zinder, or CRAS. It included members from the Mouvement Patriotique, the transport union, the lorry drivers' union, the teachers' union SNEN, the labour union USTN, the student union USN, the jobseekers' organization, and a few youth leaders from neighbourhood groups called fada. Some of CRAS's founding members had personally enjoyed positions on regional governmental committees such as the committee for the prevention of recurrent food crises under Tandja. Nevertheless, CRAS did not include all of the important civil society associations in Zinder, with several others working closely with the government or trying to stay neutral. These included rival unions such as the CNT as well as associations with international donors who therefore pursued a more extraverted agenda, such as the Reseau des Organisations pour la Transparence et l'Analyse Budgetaire (ROTAB), the Groupe de Reflexion et d'Action sur les Industries Extractives (GREN) and the country's largest human rights association, the Association Nigerienne de Defense des Droits de l'Homme (ANDDH). (8) 
		 Before the first large CRAS meeting in Zinder at the USTN compound in the city centre on 16 November 2011, I met a well-known civil society activist from ROTAB and CNT outside. Earlier that same day, I had interviewed him about his vision for the role of civil society in the country's oil future. Ele had explained that the task of civil society was to cooperate closely with government authorities to guarantee social peace and stability, to appease the population, especially violence-prone youth and the expropriated rural population, and to ensure that oil exploitation becomes a 'blessing' and not a 'curse'. Throughout the interview he had stressed the good relationship between civil society and government authorities, pointing out that he was directly involved in several governmental committees, including the organizational committee for the oil refinery's inauguration ceremony, and therefore often visited the governorate. Seeing him at the meeting place, I asked him if he would be participating, to which he retorted sharply: 'These are the people of tazarce. We don't do politics. We are not involved. In no way!' 
		 About thirty activists attended the meeting, which focused on the negative effects of oil for the Zinder region. Whereas the activist at the entrance had emphasized the opportunities that went with oil production and had stressed his good relationship with the government authorities, the attendees accused the government of corruption and incompetence. Attendees also argued that they should become members of regional government committees, like the committee to supervise the recruitment process of oil workers created by the regional and municipal councillors and the governor, or the central government committee created in Niamey to fix the country's future fuel price, or the organizational committee for the refinery's inauguration in Zinder--in short, some of the positions the ROTAB/CNT activist claimed to occupy. Whereas he had claimed to speak in the name of the entire civil society, one meeting attendee said that the absence of civil society associations such as ROTAB, GREN, CNT and ANDDH was because they were 'unjust people who had betrayed civil society of Zinder'. From its formation, CRAS's stated objective was thus to counteract what they saw as infiltration and sabotage of civil society by the state, saying that those civil society activists who were members of governmental committees were only there to enjoy good food and drinks, and then to give their blessing to everything that the government proposed. In contrast, these CRAS members portrayed themselves as the only civil society defending the interests of the Zinder region against western Nigerien domination by Issoufou's national government in Niamey and the governor of the Zinder region. 
		 To understand these divisions, it is important to know that most civil society associations in CRAS had supported tazarce, and had therefore been left empty-handed after the 2010 coup. CRAS members were thus seeking to use the inauguration as an opportunity to become reincorporated into the political game by seeking positions on regional government committees--positions that are especially attractive for members of low-and middle-income groups facing pressing demands for financial redistribution within their social networks. (9) By voicing popular grievances, CRAS members also saw the inauguration as an opportunity to deliver their list of concerns and demands to President Issoufou, hoping to do so in a face-to-face meeting, where Issoufou would be expected to hand out envelopes of money to appease his opponents. In short, using the inauguration as a stage that would bring regional and national attention, opposition civil society organizations regrouped as CRAS to once again become politically relevant and visible, to press for renewed incorporation into government power structures, and to receive monetary contributions. I therefore now look at how the disputes surrounding the oil refinery's opening evolved and the role CRAS took within this process. 
		 Two weeks before the refinery's inauguration, the government announced a new official fixed fuel price of 579 FCFA per litre (0.88 [euro]). Although this was a significant reduction on the former fuel price of 679 FCFA/litre (1.03 [euro]), it was not only much higher than the 200-250 FCFA/litre (0.30-0.38 [euro]) that CRAS and the MPPAD of Dan Dubai had been pushing for (and which appeared to have been widely hoped for among the population), but also higher than the fuel price on the black market, which was around 350 FCFA/litre (0.53 [euro]) at the time. The announcement led to unrest among the population, particularly among youth, and Dan Dubai was arrested three days prior to the inauguration for defaming President Issoufou in radio debates and press statements. 
		 The inauguration was held on 28 November. The political opposition's mobilization strategy was to not attend the opening ceremony, but rather to stage violent protests. It was effective. That day, urban youths held violent demonstrations against the president's arrival. They built street barricades of tyres and set them alight, clashed with police, and attacked Issoufou's festive procession as it made its way to the refinery. After the inauguration, mobile phone messages glorifying the riots as resistance against Issoufou and professing faith in former President Tandja were circulated. 
		 Over the following days, public debate in Zinder remained dominated by Dan Dubai's arrest. In press statements and radio debates, civil society associations demanded his release, and in mobile phone messages he was portrayed as a 'folk hero' who dared to speak the truth in the name of the poor. The chain messages also called on the population to show their support at his trial on 6 December. Members of the MPPAD occasionally attended CRAS meetings and cooperated to coordinate public action and to pressure for the release of Dan Dubai. While the MPPAD's secretary general and CRAS vice president (also aligned to the MPPAD) demanded the organization take protest action, other CRAS members were reluctant, as they wanted to steadily increase pressure on the governor--from debate to declaration to demonstration--before resorting to protest action. Arguing that demonstrations often turned violent because powerful political players had a hand in them, the other CRAS members saw street protests as a last resort and wanted to first release a memorandum on the radio. While many CRAS members viewed the governor as the 'first enemy to fight' and wanted to demand his resignation, because he had denied them access to regional government committees and an audience with the president on the inauguration day, the MPPAD did not agree with the strategy; their secretary general argued that 'we will not negotiate, we have the mass on our side, the governor must come to us'. The debate resulted in a leadership conflict, with the MPPAD member resigning from his position as CRAS vice president. The MPPAD and CRAS simply did not share the same objectives: whereas the MPPAD's ultimate aim was regime change and their primary target was thus the new president, Issoufou, leading members of CRAS again wanted to be granted places on regional government committees and their primary target was thus the regional governor. From the MPPAD's perspective of rich businessmen, CRAS was said to be a structure of 'prebendiers'--a term frequently used in Niger to denote those seeking any form of income from politicians, either through positions on committees (co-optation) or by accepting informal envelopes (bribery and corruption). 
		 Dan Dubai's 6 December trial and the two days that followed were marred by violence and disorder, with youth clashing with security forces in the streets, burning down a police station and looting a bank. Two people were killed and several were injured. CRAS members held the governor responsible for the violence and demanded his immediate resignation. The president of CRAS thereby compared the events to the student protests of 9 February 1990 that had paved the way for the transition to democracy. Blaming the political authorities, the committee's president underlined that the Zinderois were ready to die for justice. To appease the rioters, Prime Minister Brigi Raffini was sent to Zinder to meet the sultan, the governor, student representatives, the teachers' association, the parents' association and religious authorities. After the meeting at the sultanate, a joint statement appealing for calm was released. After a dispute within the student union USN about how to divide their share, it soon became public that the prime minister had distributed money at the meeting. DSN members who had not received any of the money reported that the religious authorities and the parent and teacher associations had each received 1 million FCFA (1,500 [euro]), while the USN had received 300,000 FCFA (450 [euro]). Despite this, there was hardly any public criticism of the 'fact' that the government had bought off the different representatives to subdue the tensions. Rather, the common attitude seemed to be that those USN members who were crying foul over the 'bribe money' were only doing so because they were disappointed that they had not received any of it. 
		 CRAS members were extremely disappointed: they had neither been granted an audience with the president at the refinery's inauguration, nor been appointed to the regional government committee, nor invited to the meeting with the prime minister where money was handed out. In the following weeks, the number of attendees at CRAS dropped markedly, from over thirty to around a dozen. Numbers also fell because CRAS was becoming increasingly personalized around the tiny leadership circle that had initiated it, and was thus losing legitimacy among its members and followers, who felt neither heard nor represented by the committee, nor saw any means of profiting from it. 
		 In the weeks following the pacification of Zinder, a CRAS member from the leadership circle approached me to ask for help in finding an international donor, as a source of funding would help 'make the committee a more stable civil society player'. Until then, CRAS had been in a precarious financial state and had to operate on small, sporadic contributions from its members to finance activities such as information campaigns, radio debates, press statements and public assemblies. I agreed to help in the search for an international donor and started to write emails to political and social foundations in Germany, one of which then requested that CRAS submit a proposal specifying the planned activities and the money required for so-called start-up funding. In early January, I called the member who had approached me to discuss the possibility of funding. We made an appointment to talk prior to a regular meeting. When I arrived, several other members were already present. He told me that he did not want me to talk just then, as he said that the other members were not to be trusted. After the meeting, we met together with one of his closest friends in CRAS, who was also from the same sub-organization. Here, they repeated the claim that there were 'spies' within CRAS, arguing that the governor was always up to date on the organization's activities, a problem that they said they did not have within their own organization. They therefore suggested we meet at a bar later, where I insisted that we make the plan transparent within CRAS. At the next meeting, two days later, I presented the aims and the funding possibilities of the donor institution and insisted on a collective vision from CRAS before a written proposal could be submitted. 
		 The next day, one of the two members I had met beforehand privately called to meet me so that we could write the proposal together. When I arrived, however, only the two CRAS members were present, as was the president of an NGO. The meeting was about how to write the proposal and what CRAS wanted to ask for. With his experience of writing funding proposals, the NGO president was there to help guide the process. I was there to once again outline the donor's funding guidelines, especially for start-up funding. The discussion soon centred on their material demands, which included two motorbikes as well as office equipment (desks, office chairs, computers, laptops, printers, cameras and electricity converters), tables and chairs, an internet connection, and office rent. In total, they applied for 4,560,000 FCFA (7,000 [euro]) in funding, although I explained that the funding was capped at about 4,000 [euro]. It soon became apparent that the whole application process was about neither a common vision for CRAS nor knowledge transfer among its members, but rather the appropriation of the funding opportunity by a small inner group. I nevertheless decided to translate their original proposal into German and submitted it. The proposal was rejected some weeks later. 
		 Without international donor funding, CRAS remained introverted throughout the following months and continued to sharply criticize the government. In doing so, they were attempting to mount pressure on the government in the build-up to a mass demonstration they had set for March 2012. Shortly before the demonstration was to take place, two of the committee's most influential members--the same members who had wanted me to help find an international donor--said that they had received information that opposition politicians were planning to hijack the demonstration by distributing tyres and fuel to encourage youth gangs to turn them into violent riots. After CRAS decided to cancel the demonstration, another member claimed to have proof that those who had pushed for the cancellation of the demonstration had been paid off by a wealthy businessman on behalf of the governor. In the debate among CRAS members following the accusations, it was illuminating that the discussions did not focus on the 'fact' that their comrades had accepted bribes from state officials, but rather that the accused had not shared the money with the other members. One committee member, for example, expressed his disappointment that the accused lacked solidarity, and referred to their former collective support for tazarce. He said that he had always shared contributions from the Tandja government equally among the other group members, and demanded that the other CRAS leaders did the same. With the two accused members continuously denying the existence of bribe money, CRAS stopped functioning after the dispute. 
		 The social and political embeddedness of civil society in Niger 
		 As I outlined initially, in understanding the workings of civil society, it is essential to focus on the historical sedimentation of state-society relations. While a few, rather restricted civil society associations disseminated government programmes to the population and thus had close ties to the ruling party during the authoritarian phase of Nigerien politics, the reintroduction of the multiparty system soon highlighted the ways in which the rules of the game had changed. From that time on, political competition and strategic conflicts between the opposition and the government majority became an integral part of the game. This also had implications for the role of civil society organizations. With their ability to act as counter-powers to the state in a multiparty system, civil society organizations have to be appeased, repressed or incorporated into government by political manoeuvres such as bribery, co-optation, intimidation and imprisonment. In this context, civil society groups either became increasingly incorporated into the state's administrative body or they joined the political opposition. Looking at the historical dynamics of civil society since the introduction of a multiparty system, we can thus observe episodic civil society engagement in the political game, with phases of high activity when organizations are seeking to pressure the government, and phases of low activity or invisibility when they have been repressed, co-opted, or simply assuaged by informal redistribution (cf. de Waal and Ibreck 2013). 
		 To understand this episodic civil society engagement, we have to acknowledge that the political logic of competition in a multiparty system becomes inextricably mixed with social logics that closely tie status, morality and personal integrity to gift giving and redistribution within social networks (Olivier de Sardan 1999). With such entangled logics, one--or even the--primary aim of today's civil society seems to be inclusion in the clientelist political redistribution system. Indeed, 'doing politics' (faire la politique), as it is generally referred to in Niger, is seen paradoxically both as acting outside the moral and ethical values of the community and as the only way to find employment or to be included in redistribution networks (Olivier de Sardan 2017). These infamous redistribution networks are typically referred to as PAC (parents, amis et connaissances) and are crucial for finding a job, asking for a favour or receiving support. As such, they have an existential dimension: with a virtually non-existent state social security system, the population depends on mutual assistance to survive. However, these networks also place significant pressure and demands on the employed, for they are expected to redistribute their earnings, provide favours or misuse their power to benefit their PAC. These demands are often exacerbated by the fact that those who have a good position are likely to have obtained it through the network and are therefore indebted to it. For example, when my research assistant, himself a CRAS member, started working for me, not only was he immediately expected to make contributions and give presents to his uncle's family with whom he was living, but friends and neighbours also started visiting him regularly to ask for money or credit. His personal integrity and status depended on meeting their expectations. When, as a USN member, he received the chance to campaign for the PNDS (also through his uncle, who was a PNDS member), he switched sides from opposition to government, became a party member and finally landed a job that allowed him to marry, buy a house, start a family and thus leave the state of 'masculine waiting' (Masquelier 2013) that characterizes the situation of many young men in Niger (and beyond). 
		 Looking at concrete practices of 'doing' civil society and representations of 'seeing' civil society, a gap between practices and representations becomes apparent. In numerous biographical and semi-structured interviews that I conducted with civil society activists in Niger, they presented themselves as fighting for democracy and transparency, as helping the poor and disadvantaged against the abuse of power of the country's corrupt political elite (cf. Yarrow 2011 for Ghana). To underline their fight for the collective good, they often referred to the state repression, arrests and frequent imprisonment of civil society leaders in Niger. However, as they often accused other civil society activists of not following their collective fight but rather of being prebendiers, the interviews already hinted at the patterns of co-optation, bribery and corruption that became even clearer through my participant observation of CRAS. In addition, talking to a wide range of different people during my fieldwork, I had the impression that a large part of the population in Niger had lost their faith in the country's civil society, often accusing activists of playing the political game to enrich themselves rather than to benefit society as a whole. Civil society activists (as well as state bureaucrats and politicians) are thus caught in numerous 'normative double-binds' (Bierschenk 2014): that is, the paradoxical moral orders of official democratic values and informal social rules. In this sense, it is not so much 'traditional culture' that brings forth the phenomena of corruption and cronyism, as the model of neopatrimonialism would suggest. Rather, entangled logics of material realities (social networks of subsistence and survival in the absence of a welfare state) and political realities (competition in multiparty systems) favour the social and political embeddedness of civil society. 
		 If redistribution within political networks is anticipated as a spoil of the political game, then the success of being included in these networks depends on the dynamics of an association's external as well as internal relations. For associations, effective external relations are characterized by the ability to gain political leverage. To gain this leverage, an association has to be able to put pressure on political authorities. Only with sufficient leverage can it seek and achieve a form of profitable cohabitation with the authorities, either through positions on governmental committees or through informal cash payments. This political leverage is achieved through a web of relations, with opposition politicians and wealthy businessmen on the one hand, and media on the other. For example, some influential CRAS members received politically sensitive information and payments from opposition politicians and businessmen for publishing and/or broadcasting that information. Through the media, especially radio, civil society (re)creates and strengthens its political leverage by threatening to mobilize the population against the political authorities. In doing so, civil society effectively demands that political authorities include it in political decision-making processes by creating new governmental committees and assigning places on them to civil society representatives, or by replacing members on existing committees. If their demands are not heard, they increase their threats by, for example, organizing a public meeting and inviting the media, thereby demonstrating their potential to mobilize the population. If their mobilization potential is sufficient, they could then proceed to the highest threat level: the organization of a mass demonstration or a general strike or a 'ghost town' operation. With their potential to turn violent, mass demonstrations are especially feared by the political authorities and typically provoke them to take preventative and calming measures. As I have shown, the approaching oil refinery's inauguration offered the perfect opportunity to regroup as CRAS by appropriating the sensitive topic of oil as a public issue and gaining political leverage. 
		 As we have also seen, an association's internal dynamics are crucial for its effectiveness and legitimacy, its appropriation and redistribution of spoils, and thus its very survival. Playing the internal political game is therefore about building relationships among a small inner circle of intimates or insiders who together channel the association's activities and share the positions of power and the envelopes of cash. The precarity faced by many activists, and also by large segments of the population, exacerbates a situation in which everyone is trying to get along by searching for any form of income. In such a situation, attracting bribes is a morally acceptable economic strategy within one's own social network because it takes place in politics, a field typically deemed outside society's moral universe. Moreover, as bribes often come as informal lump sums (or as goods rather than cash), they are especially desirable as recipients may more easily invest them directly in items (such as motorbikes, cars and computers) that are typically too expensive to purchase, especially given the demands to distribute more publicly known payments (such as wages) among their solidarity networks. Looking at the internal organization of CRAS, it became obvious that the committee members jockeyed for positions within the inner circle by showing their commitment, their rhetoric and communication skills, their specific political and legal knowledge, and their access to secret information. Only in these leadership positions would they ever have the opportunity to participate in governmental committees, conduct missions in the name of CRAS, and receive envelopes. Indeed, the inner circle of CRAS had all studied together in the capital, Niamey, and had long been active in civil society associations and public politics, especially within the 'Coalition against the High Cost of Living' in 2005. In doing so, they had learnt the necessary rhetoric and communication skills, gained the political and legal knowledge, and broadened their political networks of politicians and journalists. 
		 I contend that these internal and external dynamics can explain the six strong tendencies that Tidjani Alou (2015) identified among civil society organizations in Niger: proliferation, professionalization, regrouping, political intervention, personalization and an urban anchor. Political intervention is the first means to introduce oneself as a new negotiating party, to gain political leverage, and to be rewarded with spoils. An urban anchor is needed for successful political intervention, as urbanization processes assemble political power in a dense space that enables acts of infrastructural sabotage (such as demonstrations, 'ghost town' operations, burning barricades, strikes and meetings) that can stop the flow of urban life and the economy. In contrast, rural resistance in Niger is characterized by passivity or non-movements, mostly involving strategies of non-compliance and tax boycotts (Spittler 1983). Professionalization is the result of governing techniques, either through co-optation in the state's administrative body, or through external funding from international donors, as well as internal status politics within organizations and committees to claim leadership positions. Personalization and proliferation are the result of a 'rent of political liberalization', in which membership of a civil society association becomes an important source of income, be it through external funding from local businessmen or international donors, daily allowances for work on governmental committees, or informal contributions from politicians. Finally, regrouping--the result of episodic civil society engagement--is necessary to reacquire political capital after processes of personalization and co-optation have either hampered the association's social and political legitimacy and thus its negotiating power or led to its complete disintegration. 
		 The case study of CRAS, contextualized in the historically sedimented order of contemporary Niger, illustrates how civil society engagement is embedded in the same structures that shape other political actors, including their opponents. In this way, the values and language of contemporary democracy--'transparency', 'good governance', 'human rights'--that were always emphasized in interviews or public statements by civil society activists are primarily appropriated to acquire political legitimacy and do not signal the development of emancipatory politics per se. Especially prone to political party co-optation is the 'introverted' civil society that, having understood the logic of the political game over time, might even anticipate government positions or informal contributions as spoils, while more 'extraverted' civil society tends to align its political agendas to those of its international donors (which can also be seen as a form of external co-optation). However, organizational leaders also know how to constantly and strategically switch between these positions, and many are in charge of several different 'introverted' and 'extraverted' civil society organizations. 
		 Conclusion 
		 In this article, I have discussed the workings of civil society in Niger. Building on ethnographic fieldwork with a civil society committee in Zinder and historicizing civil society engagement in Niger more generally, I have shown how the historically sedimented social and political order of Niger turned co-optation, bribery and corruption into anticipated spoils of the political game. I have thus argued that Niger's civil society is embedded in both society and politics. First, civil society organizations play the political game in the same way as their political opponents and thus do not necessarily embody progressive politics. Rather, it is the language of democracy that is appropriated first of all by civil society activists to acquire political legitimacy. Second, politics are embedded in society. Among a large part of the population, the political game is seen as a moral universe apart, as an evil sphere characterized by rivalry, discord and opportunism, while society entails moral obligations of redistribution, mutual help and support for social networks (family, friends and neighbours) that demand the capture of spoils in the first place. This double embeddedness in society and politics turns co-optation, bribery and corruption into an acceptable form of income seeking as long as these spoils are redistributed within one's personal networks. Here, a paradox emerges: while the civil society activists' (and politicians') social networks demand the redistribution of spoils captured in politics among the network members, the credibility of civil society leaders (and politicians) among the wider population outside their personal networks rests on their ability to avoid playing the same dirty political game. Within this logic of Nigerien politics and society, it seems that civil society activists cannot achieve the moral high ground that they often claim over politicians.

		 (1) Civil society in Niger is made up of a host of organizations including peasant organizations, trade unions, human rights movements, Islamic associations, professional groupings, (inter)sectoral federations, development organizations, formal and informal local committees, networks, groupings and foundations, as well as some high-profile and highly mediatized organizations led by former student leaders and unionists that dominate the public sphere (Lavigne Delville 2015: 58). 
		 (2) Ordinance no. 74-1 of 22 April 1974.

		 (4) Law no. 91-06 of 20 May 1991. 
		 (5) Legislative decree no. 93-29 of 30 March 1993. 
		 (6) Marou, Arzika and Tchangari had been active members of the USN during the student protests on 9 February 1990 and had been representatives of the USN at the National Conference. At the time of the coalition. Marou Amadou, an unemployed jurist, was a member of several civil society associations, especially in democracy, transparency and human rights movements--the Collectif des Organizations de Defense des Droits de I'Homme et de la Democratie (CODDHD), the Coalition Democratique de la Societe Civile Nigerienne (CDSCN)--and. most importantly, he was the founder and president of the Comite de Reflexion et d'Orientation Independante pour la Sauvegarde des Acquis Democratiques (CROISADE). Nouhou Arzika, a manager, was the founder of consumer association OCRONI and president of the Mouvement Patriotique pour la Defense de la Nation et du Peuple (MPDNP). Kassoum lssa, a teacher, was general secretary of the teachers' union Syndicat National des Enseignants du Niger (SNEN). Moustafa Kadi was a member of Timidria, an organization to fight slavery in Niger and. importantly, the coordinator of the Collectif pour Ia Defense du Droit a l'Energie (CODDAE). Moussa Tchangari was a journalist and founder and secretary general of the civil society association and radio station Alternative Espaces Citoyens (AEC). 
		 (7) Of course, the extraverted/introverted characteristics of civil society organizations and the ideological affiliations of their leaders can only partially explain why some activists took the opportunity of co-optation at some points and not at others. All major activists have been arrested (on a number of occasions) for their struggles and may have had several opportunities to be co-opted in the past. However, with the sedimentation of almost three decades of multiparty politics since 1990, ideological considerations appear to have become less important, and the political sphere has become increasingly characterized as a dirty game. 
		 (8) Nevertheless, the national coordinator of ROTAB in Niamey, Ah Idrissa, is publicly known to have close ties with the Lutnana party, which was part of the government at that time. In addition, the former national coordinator of GREN, Salissou Oubandoma, became vice president of the Haute Autorite de Lutte Contre la Corruption (HALCIA), which was created to fight corruption in the public sector in July 2011 after Issoufou had come to power. 
		 (9) Leading CRAS members were mostly teachers with an income of about 100,000 FCFA (150 [euro]) per month: other CRAS members earned less, and some were unemployed and earning a living from small informal brokerage services.

<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 Sept 26 (Reuters)  
		 (Adds details) 
		 Sept 26 (Reuters) - Juan Imhoff capped a flowing break to score the only try in the dying minutes as Racing 92 came from behind to beat defending champions Saracens 19-15 in their European Champions Cup semi-final at <meronyme id="1737">Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> on Saturday. 
		 The victory sent France's Racing, who were runners-up in 2016 and 2018, into their third final at the expense of the three-times champions, and they await the winners of the second Anglo-French semi-final between Exeter Chiefs and Toulouse.
		Teddy Iribaren scored three first-half penalties to send Racing into the break with a 9-6 lead but Saracens turned up the heat after the restart via the boot of Alex Goode, who ended the match with five successful penalty kicks of his own. 
		 Saracens made a bright start to the second period, dominating the scrum and putting Racing under pressure with their kicking game. 
		 Goode, filling in at flyhalf for the suspended Owen Farrell as he did in Saracens' thrilling quarter-final win over Leinster, gave his team a six-point lead with three penalty kicks, but Saracens lost Brad Barritt to a head injury just after the hour. 
		 The captain's departure proved a bitter blow for Saracens, who had already lost half the team that took them to the title last season. 
		 Substitute Maxime Machenaud pulled Racing back to within three points with a penalty as Saracens were forced to reshuffle their pack before a moment of brilliance from Finn Russell sparked the game's decisive moment. 
		 Russell found Virimi Vakatawa with a delicate chip over the Saracens midfield and the New Zealand-born centre powered into space before offloading back to the Racing flyhalf, who released Imhoff to cross with three minutes left on the clock. 
		 Machenaud made no mistake with the conversion, shredding Saracens' dreams of European glory. 
		 Saracens will drop into England's second tier at the end of the 2019-20 Premiership campaign after being relegated for breaching salary cap rules and will not be allowed to compete in Europe as a second-tier club next season. 
		 Both teams were forced to contend with early injuries, with Racing losing flanker Fabien Sanconnie to a head injury in the third minute and Saracens centre Duncan Taylor going off with an injured left shoulder. (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Clare Fallon)

<texte>
		ENPNewswire-November 23, 2020--GREEN LIGHT FOR FCMS, INDRA AND THALES TO START DESIGNING THE SENSORS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO NGWS/FCAS SUPERIORITY 
		 (C)2020 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 23112020 - Highlights: 
		 * The consortium made up of FCMS, Indra and Thales will develop an innovative state-of-the-art suite of connected and distributed sensors
		* The sensors, designed to meet the operational challenges of the 2040s, following the requirements of the participating nations, will contribute to the NGWS/FCAS situational awareness and ability to operate without being detected 
		 * The understanding and close collaboration between the three industrial partners has accelerated the definition of the project goals and the signing of the contract 
		 <mention id="1738">Paris-La Defense</mention>.- Germany, Spain and France the three driving forces of the NGWS/FCAS program, have entrusted FCMS, Indra and Thales with the development of the innovative suite of sensors that will equip the Future European Combat Air System. 
		 The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) on behalf of the three nations, has signed the contract with Indra as leader of the industrial consortium in order to incorporate the Sensors as part of the Phase 1 contractual framework. The Phase 1 A Concept Study for Sensors will last for one year, a period which may be extended by another six months. 
		 The consortium will work on the design of the concepts required to meet the stakes of 2040 and beyond for the next generation combat system, involving a connected and distributed architecture of sensors, the design of future sensors architectures and the maturation of the associated sensors technologies. 
		 This distributed sensor architecture will leverage the capabilities provided by the NGWS/FCAS combat cloud, with improved system situational awareness and increased platforms survivability. The sensors pillar consortium looks forward to working together with the other NGWS/FCAS pillars (Combat Cloud, Next Generation Fighter, Remote Carriers) in order to optimize the design and integration of the Sensors within the System and platforms. 
		 The signing of this initial contract provides evidence of the excellent harmony and spirit of collaboration among FCMS, Indra and Thales. According to Manuel Rodriguez Cerezo, the Director of the NGWS/FCAS program at Indra, 'the industrial cooperation and the proactivity demonstrated by the three companies have facilitated the taking of this first step to move ahead with the program'. 
		 The development of the sensor pillar is essential to ensure consistent architectures that are perfectly integrated into the new generation fighters (NGF), unmanned systems and remote operators (RCs) and the combat cloud. The superiority of the NGWS/FCAS will largely depend on the capacity of its network of sensors to compile more and better information than the adversary.

<titre>FRANCE-PROTESTS/PENSIONS-SPIDERMAN (UPDATE 2, PIX, TV) UPDATE 2-'French Spider-Man' scales <meronyme id="1739">Total tower</meronyme> in support of pension strikes</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>

		 By Dominique Vidalon and Manuel Ausloos  
		 (Adds quotes from interview) 
		 By Dominique Vidalon and Manuel Ausloos 
		 PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Alain Robert, the free climber dubbed the "French Spider-Man", on Monday scaled the <meronyme id="1740">Tour Total</meronyme>, <meronyme id="1741">a 48-storey skyscraper in Paris</meronyme>, to demonstrate support for workers striking against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans.
		Robert, 57, stood with both arms aloft after reaching the summit of <meronyme id="1742">the 187-metre (613-foot) high tower</meronyme>, which stands in <mention id="1743">the French capital's business district</mention>, <mention id="1744">La Defense</mention>. 
		 "I am trying to use my fame for something I find meaningful," Robert told Reuters, adding that he was himself "deeply concerned" by the pension reform plans. 
		 "Sponsors only give me money if I climb," he said. 
		 France has been dogged by strikes and street protests for more than a month as unions push back against Macron's drive to streamline the pension system and avert a looming 17 billion euro pension deficit. 
		 Macron's government said on Saturday it was willing to withdraw a proposal to raise the retirement age to break the deadlock with unions. 
		 Robert has climbed more than 100 structures, including the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the world's tallest building, the Burj al Khalifa in Dubai. 
		 Monday's ascent was the ninth time that Robert had climbed <meronyme id="1745">the Total tower</meronyme>. 
		 Robert often climbs without permission and has been arrested on numerous occasions. He climbs without a harness, using only his bare hands, a pair of climbing shoes, and a bag of powdered chalk to wipe off the sweat.

		 Share this article
		- Thales applies innovative Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology, designed for massive parallel data processing, to power its Biometric Matching System. 
		 - With Gemalto's commercial off-the-shelf FPGA solution, Thales allows the number of servers to be cut in half and dramatically limits the overall carbon footprint. 
		 - Border Agencies introducing Entry/Exit systems and other government agencies requiring real-time response can now benefit from low latency biometric data processing and greater scalability, while saving costs. 
		 <mention id="1755">Paris La Defense</mention> - Thales, world leader in digital security, is using innovative assets from the aerospace industry to boost its Biometric Matching System (BMS) performance while reducing the environmental impact. The BMS is the heart of government digital identification systems. Introducing interoperability with its border management system requires multiple processing of hundreds of millions of biometric database records within 1 to 2 seconds. To perform data comparison at this scale Gemalto, a Thales company, is applying commercial off-the-shelf Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology, originally designed for ultra-low latency applications in high performance computing (HPC) environments in financial and scientific industry, which is compatible with any server and cloud. 
		 Specifically, Gemalto uses these FPGA boards for matching hundreds of millions of biometric fingerprint templates which are digital signatures, created from fingerprint images. This proven solution also allows for much faster data processing and greater matching accuracy, while at the same time limiting infrastructure costs and cutting carbon emissions. Depending on server and system specification, it can require up to 75% less servers and energy overall. 
		 Gemalto's Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) are scalable and customizable solutions, providing a range of functionalities for processing, editing, searching, retrieving, and storing fingerprint, palm print, face and iris images and biographic subject records. With FPGA, ABIS makes it easier for government agencies to run very large and complex multi-biometric solutions with remarkable matching accuracy and speed, enabling States to better protect and serve their citizens. 
		 "Our FPGA based solution can cut data centre investment and space overall by more than a half, whilst reducing CO2 emissions by around 50%. Gemalto technology brings new options for governments wishing to prioritise environmental sustainability, without in any way impacting national security." says Youzec Kurp - SVP Identity &amp; Biometric Solutions at Thales. "The alternative of a pure Central Processing Unit based approach for biometric data matching requires massive computing capacity - even, in some cases, up to four times more servers than Gemalto's approach - to perform the same transaction."

		* Minister: "bicycle to be the queen of deconfinement" (Adds cycling federation, Paris mayor comments) 
		 By Geert De Clercq and Forrest Crellin 
		 PARIS, April 30 (Reuters) - France will contribute 50 euros per person towards bicycle repairs after a nationwide coronavirus lockdown ends on May 11, taking an innovative step to encourage cycling and keep cars off city roads. 
		 Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday a 20 million euro ($22 million) plan for repairing bicycles, installing temporary bike parking spaces and financing cycling coaching sessions. 
		 The government is keen to get more people cycling and reduce overcrowding in metros and buses, where it is hard to practice the social distancing required to prevent virus transmission. 
		 Borne said the government will also accelerate a programme allowing employers to cover up to 400 euros of travel costs of staff who cycle to work. 
		 "We want this period to be a new stage towards a cycling culture and we want the bicycle to be the queen of deconfinement," Borne said on her Twitter feed. 
		 French cycling federation FUB, which will coordinate the bike repair programme, said the government has prepared 300,000 cheques worth 50 euros for the repair programme and said the scheme would be extended if it is a success. 
		 "Cycling can contribute to preventing a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic," FUB's president Olivier Schneider said. 
		 Paris and other cities are also planning to create new bike lanes by taking space away from car lanes. 
		 Pierre Serne, who coordinates the government's cycling plan, told local radio France Bleu that the region around Paris plans to create up to 750 km of new bike lanes on departmental roads to make it easier for commuters to cycle in from towns outside the capital, notably on electric bikes for longer distances. 
		 Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter the city will create new bike lanes along busy metro lines 1, 4 and 13. She also said that major east-west thoroughfare Rue de Rivoli will be reserved for cycling, with only buses, taxis and emergency vehicles allowed on it. 
		 The city is also making plans to improve bike lane connections to <mention id="1758">the financial district of La Defenseon the western side of Paris</mention>. 
		 Paris currently has about 370 km of bike paths and the temporary lanes are expected to increase that to 650 km. ($1 = 0.9145 euros) (Reporting by Forrest Crellin and Geert De Clercq Writing by Geert De Clercq Editing by Bate Felix/Giles Elgood/Susan Fenton)

<titre>Seine decision France property Paris is benefiting from the Brexit bounce, but other factors are conspiring to drive demand too. By Hugo Cox</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		A s the UK's exit from the EU approaches, and many of London's leading financial institutions look to Paris for their relocation plans, agents in the city are enjoying a Brexit bounce. Currently, 14 major financial services firms — most of them investment banks — have confirmed staff moves to Paris or plans to open a subsidiary, meaning that 2,000 jobs are set to move from London to Paris or be newly created in Paris, according to PwC. 
		 Home Hunts, which finds French properties for affluent international buyers, had 342 inquiries from UK customers for Paris homes in the first half of this year, more than double the 165 it received in the same period in 2017.
		"A good number are London-based, working in finance and are buying as an investment, with the view that it could become a more permanent home if they are relocated," says Tim Swannie of Home Hunts. "They are seeking a base in Paris as a hedge against [an unfavourable] Brexit outcome," says Edward de Mallet Morgan at Knight Frank. 
		 The Brexit bounce is only half the story, however. Inquiries to Home Hunts from Middle Eastern buyers — mainly those from UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia — increased from 90 in the first six months of 2017 to just under 200 in the first half of 2018. Some of this is because of buyers deserting London for a more reliable European base. But the growing demand for top-end homes from this region is also driven by the recovering oil price, with buyers from the region favouring the French capital for its history, culture and reputation for high fashion. 
		 Whatever the cause, two years after the Brexit vote — from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of this year — prime property prices in Paris had risen 17.5 per cent, according to Knight Frank. In the three months to September 2018, prices jumped 2.7 per cent. Avenue Foch in the 16th arrondissement is the must-have destination for the truly minted from countries like Saudi Arabia or Qatar, says De Mallet Morgan: the street, which branches off from the Arc de Triomphe, contains some of the largest homes to be found in any European city, he says. The 16th arrondissement adjoins the Bois de Boulogne and is close to <mention id="1759">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1760">Paris's business district</mention>. The most sought after spots are the northern reaches around Trocadéro, says Gabriel Malassis of Agence Varenne, a Savills associate. "This area offers the remarkable Haussmann properties, often with views over Paris but also private mansions and houses with gardens." 
		 On Rue Charles Lamoureux, Christie's International Real Estate is selling a grand, four-bedroom apartment with high ceilings for €4.05m. Just over the Avenue de la Grande-Armée, in the 17th arrondissement, Knight Frank is selling a two-bedroom apartment for €2.275m. 
		 Swannie's buyers — many of whom are financial workers favouring the short commute to <mention id="1761">La Défense</mention> — are shopping for two or three-bedroom apartments in Haussmann-designed buildings with a caretaker. In the 16th, a short stroll from the Arc de Triomphe, Home Hunts is selling an 1850s townhouse with six bedrooms for €10.3m. The 6th and 7th arrondissements — which house many of the city's most famous landmarks — are popular topend spots too, says Swannie. 
		 Aside from the Brexit vote, most agents attribute the recent price gains to the election of Emmanuel Macron last May and the more welcoming tax regime that it has signalled. Particularly influential has been the January replacement of France's wealth tax with an equivalent annual levy focused exclusively on property. 
		 For French residents the previous tax had been raised on all worldwide assets over a value of €1.3m, from homes — including those owned abroad — and yachts to financial investments, cars and jewellery. Non-French residents faced an equivalent tax on all assets they held in France over the same amount. With the new tax now restricted to property (and excluding the portion owned through a mortgage) rich French expats who fled under previous president François Hollande are returning home in increasing numbers, say agents. More recently, French authorities have dangled tax breaks in front of London bankers. A UK expat in France with an annual income of €1m including allowances could take home more than €180,000 more than she would in the UK, according to research by PwC for the FT. 
		 As Brexit approaches, the city will continue to benefit from the uncertainty surrounding London's finance sector. Even with "modest Brexit relocations" the sector is set to grow at 2 per cent per year, according to Richard Holt of Oxford Economics in London. "If there are further pro-business reforms, then given the city's huge business and cultural assets, Paris could become a big rival to London."

<texte>
		ENPNewswire-January 7, 2020--ESSEC embraces real-time distance learning with Barco virtual classroom 
		 (C)2020 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 06012020 - Barco weConnect enables leading international business school to bring forward innovative new remote learning program for students worldwide. 
		 The world-renowned ESSEC Business School has pioneered a new approach to real-time distance learning thanks to a major investment in a state-of-the-art virtual classroom solution from global technology company Barco.
		The school, which has been teaching for over a century, is one of the leading business schools in Europe. At its Executive Education Campus in <mention id="1763">La Defense</mention>, Paris, ESSEC has just installed Barco's weConnect virtual classroom at its main campus to enable the school to provide business courses to professionals around the world. 
		 The pioneering move by ESSEC reflects and embraces the growing desire by professional students to receive training in a variety of different ways. According to ESSEC, on-campus teaching will always be a fundamental part of education at all levels. But with participants who are often learning while working full-time, the ability to provide remote, non-linear training of the same quality and interactivity as face-to-face learning is now crucial to all educational institutions. 
		 Vincenzo Esposito Vinzi, President and Dean of ESSEC Business School said: 'In today's digital world, educators need to ensure they are utilizing the latest innovative technologies to provide a blended learning experience. Participants need to be able to join lectures flexibly, accessibly and securely, without feeling like their experience will be sub-standard or that they will miss out on important peer-to-peer interaction. Teachers, meanwhile, need to feel completely confident in the technology and the interaction they have with participants, so they can focus on doing what they do best.' 
		 The Barco weConnect solution enables teachers at ESSEC to replicate a physical classroom for remote participants. The teacher stands at the front of the classroom as in a traditional learning environment, but with up to 84 people joining remotely. The participants are all displayed to the teacher on a series of screens at 100% real-life size, meaning that interaction between teacher and participant can happen just as it does in a live classroom environment. 
		 The system has various interactivity features including the ability to issue live polls and quizzes, hold moderated Q&amp;As, and to split groups into breakout sessions - enabling small, close-collaboration working groups between participants who might be physically in all four corners of the globe. 
		 Stephane Potelle, Head of Digital Campus at ESSEC explains: 'With a 100% online learning program, students have especially high expectations of the learning they want to receive, and those expectations will often be formed by the ingrained picture they have of a more traditional learning environment. So whether you are providing synchronous or asynchronous learning, in whatever format, you need to do it in a way that feels most comfortable to both teacher and learner. 
		 'Barco's weConnect solution enables our faculty to offer different learning methods depending on the course material and the preferences of the participants. But by mirroring a traditional lecture it ensures both the participants and the educators are fully engaged and comfortable in the environment.' 
		 ESSEC is currently running an extensive testing phase with the new facility and training its employees - not just the teachers but also the support staff who will manage and 'produce' the lessons - on how to use the solution to its full potential. Once testing is complete, they will be rolling out a new program of virtual classes in January - not only enabling a greater cohort of students to receive the benefit of ESSEC's world-leading training, but bringing in valuable new revenue streams to the business school. 
		 Ellen Van de Woestijne, Segment Marketing Director at Barco said: 'The education sector is undergoing a major period of digital transformation at the moment. The most forward-thinking educational institutions are realizing that it's vital to invest in new technologies to be able to deliver courses in a way that works with students' lives, which meets their always-rising expectations and, most importantly, to bring in valuable new revenue streams and facilitate further growth and success. 
		 'ESSEC had tried other solutions for this such as traditional video conferencing, but they found that these systems simply weren't able to facilitate the type of interaction and engagement that makes a virtual course successful. We are pleased that they chose our weConnect technology to ensure their remote students have the best possible learning experience and have been thrilled by the reaction this had from their educators.'

<titre>Great disappointment, shifting opportunities: a glimpse into the Comintern, Western European parties and their colonial work in the Third Period.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 In early 1929, Robin Page Arnot and James Ford, both sponsored by the Comintern, each set out on a trip to investigate what Western European communist parties had accomplished in their campaigns on colonialism and racial inequality. Both men issued stern reports suggesting more could be done; but following these investigations a proposed European colonial conference never happened. The League Against Imperialism petered out. The International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers formed, but consistently dealt with discrimination and received limited, if any, help from European communist parties. Using Executive Committee politsecretariat documents, this article argues that the Comintern quickly abandoned an emphasis on colonial work, instead focusing on domestic campaigns when contacting these parties between 1929 and 1935. Highlighting the migration of these ideas transnationally, while offering a comparative analysis of the Executive Committee of the Communist International's interventions into each party, this research serves as a starting point for further inquiry into why the Comintern elected to not press these European parties to do more. Was their inaction because the Comintern was always Eurocentrically-minded? Was it because Comintern leaders were only paying lip service to these concepts? Was it that the Comintern prioritized other matters, especially as the Great Depression and the rise of fascism brought new challenges to communism? This article sheds some light on these questions by exposing the way in which the Comintern instructed each party to focus on in their broader campaigns. Keywords: anti-imperialism, racial equality, transnationalism
		In early 1929, Robin Page Arnot, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and a representative of the Comintern's Eastern Secretariat, began a tour of Western European communist parties to discover each party's engagement with colonial affairs. At the same time, James Ford, a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) and a representative of the Comintern's Anglo-American Secretariat's Negro Commission, took a similar trip. He focused on determining how much 'negro work' each party was doing. When they finished their travels, both individuals came to the same conclusion--Western European communist parties were not doing enough colonial work. 
		 The findings of Arnot and Ford led to discussion within the Comintern bureaucracy about how Western European parties could improve the attention they gave to colonial or racial issues. Arnot, through the Eastern Secretariat, endorsed a set of theses by Hungarian communist Ludwig Madiar which gave clear instructions to Western European communists. Arnot also supported a colonial conference to take place in the spring of 1929, inviting representatives of the major Western European parties (the British, French, Dutch and Belgian Communist Parties) to make colonial affairs a greater focus of party work. Ford, meanwhile, promoted the creation of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers (ITUCNW). The committee gained support from the Red International of Labour Unions to organise black workers on both sides of the Atlantic and to promote the end of racial oppression of black Africans and African Americans. 
		 Both men were involved in projects to rectify these shortcomings, regardless of whether they were real (the ITUCNW) or imagined (a colonial conference). The colonial conference never occurred. The Comintern claimed it would discuss Western European communist efforts in colonial affairs at either the Frankfurt Congress of the League Again Imperialism (LAI) or the Comintern's Tenth Plenum. That work did not happen and the Comintern quietly dropped that project. The ITUCNW formed, albeit with great difficult, and much stonewalling from European parties. It never seemed to be able to operate as smoothly as it could have. 
		 The conclusions of both Arnot and Ford regarding the lack of sufficient effort by European parties on colonial and racial issues were part of a long history of Comintern criticism of European (and American) parties on colonial work. As early as 1924 at the Comintern's Fifth Congress, when Bolshevik Dmitry Manuilsky delivered his report on the colonial world, he criticized the French and British parties for not doing enough. Many other delegates, such as the future Ho Chi Minh, who was then affiliated with the Parti Communist Frangais (PCF), added to the chorus, affirming European communism's shortcomings. Four years later at the Sixth Comintern Congress, Otto Kuusinen, chair of the Eastern Secretariat, reaffirmed that the British and French parties had failed in their efforts to support anti-colonialism. Allegedly, European affairs always mattered more to European parties, leading critics of communists to see the leadership of the movement as Eurocentric and typically aloof from colonial affairs, a charge stemming from well before the foundation of the Comintern. 
		 But this narrative, promoted by high level Comintern officials, is a flawed one. The parties that occupied much of the spotlight of these critiques, and certainly those of Arnot and Ford, all made some strides to promote colonial work or combat racial oppression. The CPGB supported Indian communism, exemplified in its assistance in forming the Communist Party of India and in the role of British representatives Philip Spratt and Ben Bradley in the Meerut Conspiracy Case, where, in 1929, the British government arrested thirty-three trade unionists and left-nationalists, and charged them with conspiracy to undermine British rule in India. The party also supported several groups organising black migrants. (1) The PCF backed Lamine Senghor's Comite pour la Defense de la Race Negre (CDRN) and later La Ligue de Defense de la Race Negre (LDRN), which was taken over by Tiemoko Garan Kouyate following Senghor's death; both groups sought to promote the interests of blacks across the French Empire. The PCF endorsed the efforts of the Union Intercoloniale, defending the interests of migrant workers within France. (2) The Communist Party of Holland (CPH) was deeply involved in Indonesian independence campaigns of the 1920s. (3) Each of these parties also had notable chapters of the League Against Imperialism (LAI), a Comintern auxiliary organisation to promote anti-imperialist efforts internationally. To say these parties did nothing in the field of colonial or racial affairs is inaccurate. 
		 A better question is why, when the Comintern had concerns about European communism's efforts to support colonial or racial issues, did it do nothing to bring these European communist parties into line? A prominent debate in the Comintern historiography deals with the control Moscow had over its member parties. Orthodox historians tend to argue that the Comintern had full control of the movement and dictated much of the platforms of individual parties. Opponents of this view, often termed revisionists, have highlighted examples where parties had freedom to act and argued that the Comintern did not necessarily have long tendrils into each party. (4) Discussions on this topic have addressed the work of certain parties on racial or colonial issues, as exemplified by the exchange between Marika Sherwood and John Callaghan twenty years ago. (5) 
		 However, the role of colonial work, and its importance in the Comintern, remains difficult to determine. Neil Redfern, for example, suggested it was not important to the CPGB in the early 1920s, before becoming a notable element of party work. In another article, Redfern argues that, by the late 1930s, colonial work ceased to be a consideration at all for the Comintern, exemplified by the death of the League Against Imperialism. (6) This issue becomes more complicated when one considers that the Third Period (1928-1935) was one of great excitement and growing attention to racial equality and anti-colonial campaigns. For example, Minkah Makalani details how the establishment of the LAI, and later the ITUCNW, encouraged black organisers and communists, believing that the Comintern would champion their cause. When the Comintern failed to provide financial or organisational support, or when the harsh limits of the Comintern's general line at the time limited the ability to develop relationships with other like-minded groups, black leaders in the movement grew frustrated. Some leaders, like George Padmore, tried to straddle the divide between maintaining the Comintern line, while subtly including more radical or nuanced approaches to the struggle, before pulling away from the movement in favour of promoting their own ideas. (7) Despite the Comintern's general failure to build on the momentum of the movement, S. Ani Mukherji highlights how Moscow during the first half of the 1930s became another black diasporic centre in Europe with the Soviet Union offering material support to anti-racist and anti-colonial propaganda, giving black cultural workers prominent roles. (8) Despite the brief push for more focus on these issues coming out of the Sixth Congress, supported in Moscow, why does the Comintern disconnect from this momentum when dealing with its member parties? 
		 One option may be to focus on the Comintern's priorities. In doing so, we can understand why some parties saw wholesale intervention which uprooted entire party leaderships. This situation happened, for example, when the Communist Party of South Africa failed to accept the Native Republic Thesis as the Comintern demanded. Other parties, however, received a slap on the wrist, or no intervention, on related issues. (9) By focusing on prioritisation, it can also help one determine what was at work when Arnot and Ford made their trips across Europe. The pair reaffirmed what the Comintern seemingly already accepted. If work in support of colonial liberation and against racial oppression in Europe was so important to the Comintern, why did it never really resolve these shortcomings? Rather than offloading the issues to the individual parties, which had numerous issues that prevented them from reaching the lofty goals the Comintern and colonial delegates had for them, why did the Comintern not step in? After all, it had done so many other times regarding concerns over deviationists or the improper implementation of tactics. One response could be to state that Comintern leaders merely paid lip service to the problem, making it a point of emphasis at Comintern Congresses to condemn parties, largely for propaganda purposes, to win over jilted colonial communists. But this answer overlooks the legitimate interventions on colonial and racial issues, such as when the centre intervened in the CPUSA to ensure greater focus on African American affairs by bringing the party's executive committee into line on the Black-Belt Thesis and self-determination for African Americans, while making work amongst black communities a priority for all members, regardless of race. (10) Although this argument could be maintained for the public criticism of European parties, it fails to consider the direct correspondence between the ECCI and member parties. To resolve this gap, is it as Makalani suggests in his work that European parties tended to dismiss the Native Republic or Black Belt Theses, believing each only applied to a specific context? Furthermore, did the Comintern only see black issues 'largely as an American Negro problem'? (11) Surely, the Comintern could correct the former issue if it was a mistaken assumption by a given party's leadership, especially as it was encouraging broader applications of self-determination on racial lines in the Americas. (12) As a starting point to determine what really was at work, starting from these transnational trips that Arnot and Ford took, and reviewing the follow-up correspondence between the ECCI politsecretariat and the respective communist parties during the duration of the Third Period, I hope to shed some light on these issues. I propose that the ECCI simply chose not to intervene on colonial affairs or racial issues in the European case. Instead, it prioritised other issues, namely European support for Soviet aims and other foreign political concerns, such as limiting the reach of fascism, but the reasons are multifaceted and require further research by scholars of the Comintern and European communist parties. 
		 Arnot's transnational voyage 
		 Remembering the condemnatory conclusions of his speech at the Sixth Comintern Congress towards the colonial work of Western European communist parties, Kuusinen sent Arnot to travel throughout Western Europe on a fact-finding mission. He chose Arnot because of his membership in the CPGB and his roles in the Eastern and Anglo-American Secretariats. In January and February 1929, Arnot visited Frankfurt, Cologne, London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. During this trip, he met with LAI head Willi Munzenberg, other LAI members, and the leaderships of the CPGB, the PCF, the CPH and the Communist Party of Belgium (CPB). (13) 
		 In his report, Arnot highlighted his disappointment with the parties' colonial work, reinforcing the long-held criticisms of Comintern leaders and colonial delegates. Each party failed to build networks with colonial contacts and seemed to have no idea of how to do so. The LAI, which theoretically should have made colonial work easier, was not effective; the British section was isolated and the Dutch and Belgian parties questioned the value of the League. The CPGB's small size was a problem and it had few connections to the emigre community. The French party seemed to be the best off of the four parties Arnot met, buoyed by the existence of LDRN. Even still, it was only a small glimmer of hope. Domestic issues dominated the work of these parties. (14) 
		 The solution to these issues would be a potential colonial conference, to be held later that year, which would teach these parties how to increase their engagement in colonial matters, and in turn, improve their support of their colonial counterparts. Originally, in a report to the politsecretariat of the ECCI, Comintern officials thought Berlin or Cologne would be a good location to hold such a conference in April 1929 with roughly two-thirds (nineteen out of thirty-one) of its delegates coming from Western European communist parties. The politsecretariat formed a commission for the potential conference. At its first meeting, on 19 March 1929, the commission tasked communist parties to submit reports on their colonial work. In preparation for the conference, Arnot and Madiar wrote 'The Organisation of the Colonial Work of the European Communist Parties', a primer on European communism's problems in undertaking colonial work and the best methods to solve them. (15) The pair restated the same criticisms of Kuusinen at the Sixth Congress and Arnot in his report. Arnot and Madiar articulated that publications on colonial affairs should be made widely available in the party press and extended to colonial parties. European parties should act as older brothers to the colonial parties, mentoring and advising them. The European parties should also send representatives to oversee the colonial parties while also establishing grassroots connections with everyday people, the report said. The resolution also suggested more money was needed to improve the research and knowledge the Comintern had of its affiliated parties' actions. Generally, the parties needed to do more and take colonial affairs seriously, including simply getting anti-colonial activists into party circles. (16) As historian Fredrik Petersson highlights, the organisational weaknesses of each European party were crucial in stymying colonial work in Western Europe. (17) 
		 The conference never happened. Outside of the CPH, most parties ignored the request to submit reports to the commission on the conference. Initially, the Comintern postponed the conference until June, and then to July, before finally deciding to have it take place during the Tenth ECCI Plenum. That did not happen either. 18 Petersson, in his work on the LAI, adds that this could be because of the Plenum's proximity to the LAI's Second Congress in Frankfurt. He also astutely points out that, even if the colonial conference was to be merged with this Congress, it would not be likely because of the differing aims of the two events. One intended to correct the approach of Western European parties to colonial work; the Frankfurt Congress was about the LAI 'mak[ing] the leap from demonstration to becoming an international mass organization'. (19) The Western European Secretariat mentioned the colonial conference again in 1930, reflecting on its continued necessity, but no further planning occurred. (20) 
		 Ford's transnational journey 
		 Ford made a similar trip at the same time as Arnot, travelling to Cologne, Brussels, Paris, Berlin and finally, Hamburg. During this trip, Ford spoke to the Executive Committee of the LAI, representatives of the Belgian, French and German parties, and also of various affiliated organisations such as LDRN. Ford spoke with these communists in hopes of building a network across the black Atlantic. He also wanted to ensure that the Comintern's attention to 'negro work', reflected in the nascent International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, would be successful. Much as Arnot's trip affirmed a lack of attention to anti-colonial issues, Ford's did too. Each meeting revealed that parties had failed to make contacts in Africa or do much on anti-colonial issues, Ford said. (21) Upon returning to Moscow, he delivered a report with suggestions for improvement. 
		 Ford advised that each party, including the British party, which he had not met, should receive detailed instructions about what is expected for each party. A section of the Negro Bureau of the Eastern Secretariat should be established in Paris, along with added support for the work of the LDRN. 'One or two comrades' should go to Africa to develop contacts to organise black Africans. Finally, the LAI, and the Comintern's new line (the Native Republic Thesis and Class against Class), should be 'fully' established within the apparatus. (22) Despite these efforts, Harry Haywood, a prominent African American member of the Bureau, echoed his disappointment, highlighting the 'shortcomings' of the British and French parties. Suggesting they were both plagued by indifference, Haywood urged both the French and British parties to place sufficient attention on 'Negro work' and link it to the broader colonial question. 'The strengthening of the alliance between the proletariat in metropolitan countries and the Negroes and other subject masses becomes particularly an urgent task', adding that 'indifference' was a symptom of 'the expression of the Right danger', linking factional issues to the matter and attaching a particular strong condemnation to the efforts of the PCF and the CPGB. (23) 
		 Unlike the colonial conference, the ITUCNW founding congress did occur in 1930 in Hamburg, Germany, establishing a clear platform to organise and unite the black Atlantic. Whereas the League Against Imperialism's Frankfurt Congress had different aims than the proposed colonial conference, it did offer a location where the delegates interested in the ITUCNW, along with representatives from Africa, could discuss the formative plans for an ITUCNW congress, set to take place in July 1930 in London, England. In early 1930, representatives travelled to meet with potential groups and parties, extending invitations to the conference. As with the proposed colonial conference, national parties again seemed unwilling to put much effort into preparing for the event. Furthermore, it appears the Comintern offered little support as African American communist William Patterson frequently noted a lack of necessary funding for the conference or for travel. When Britain's Labour Government balked at the ITUCNW congress taking place in London, organisers moved it to Hamburg, Germany. The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) did little to help them and the LAI's German Section stepped in to help in final preparations and accommodate some of the delegates for the meeting. The conference, finally, began on 4 July; only seventeen delegates gathered. They formed the working committee for the ITUCNW in Hamburg to run the union's affairs, elected an executive and passed several resolutions. (24) 
		 Ramifications 
		 Stemming from the Sixth Comintern Congress, the Comintern recognised a problem existed in the Western European efforts on colonial and 'negro' work. The Comintern sent two representatives to determine why these shortcomings existed and how to resolve them. But one can question the genuine desire of the ECCI to solve these issues. The Tenth Plenum of the ECCI did not do much to address these long-held concerns. In fact, even the LAI's Frankfurt Congress focused more on applying Third Period tactics and criticising non-communist support of its efforts, firmly placing it under the Comintern's ideological perspective. At the major meetings of Comintern representatives in the summer of 1929, stunningly, communists were silent in attempting to address the failures of the national parties to develop tactics for colonial liberation. 
		 On issues regarding racial oppression and work among black workers, the Negro Bureau and the ITUCNW remained vocal in their critiques of Western European parties and even the Comintern itself in the aftermath of the 1930 conference. Ford, for example, argued that parties neglected to consider black issues as significant. The Comintern needed to bring the parties into line, he asserted, although he still lauded the founding congress of the ITUCNW itself. (25) One month later, in August 1930, another report sharpened the criticism of European communists. The report highlighted that European parties always had a 'tremendously favourable situation for Negro work', and one which had become further conducive to communist-led initiatives due to the ascendancy of the Third Period, but the failure of Western European parties, specifically the CPGB and the PCF, to detail the situations in the colonies which could facilitate proper work made it difficult to say anything more concrete. Thus, work needed to begin with improving the appreciation of European parties for colonial work by reacquainting them with the Comintern's resolutions on the National and Colonial Questions at the Second and Sixth Congresses. Trade union and auxiliary organisations should be developed for work in black colonies, the report continued. It specifically noted the role of LDRN, but argued it was not yet incorporated into the line of the PCF and, thus, still needed its ideological message corrected. Furthermore, the KPD greeted the development of the Liga zur Verteidigung der Negerrasse (LzVN) with equal disinterest. The French and British parties had no black cadres, and limited--or no--press for black issues. Finally, the report criticised the 'Centre', reflecting on the challenges in preparing the ITUCNW conference and the need for a strengthened Negro Bureau for 'negro work' to be effective and to ensure proper oversight of the British and French parties. (26) Generally speaking, by mid-1930s, the challenges that afflicted Western European colonial or black work had seemingly increased with no signs of abating. 
		 The work of the ITUCNW and the various auxiliary black worker organisations that developed in the early 1930s showed the paradoxical stance of international communism on racial issues in the Third Period. The establishment of the Hamburg working group and the ITUCNW served as a significant moment, establishing an attempt to organise the black Atlantic. The growing work of the LDRN, even if flawed, the role of Kouyate in black communist circles, and the LDRN's expansion with the establishment of the LzVN, alongside the formation of multiple African auxiliary associations, such as the Negro Welfare Association or the Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society, both in Britain, served to establish connections and popularise black issues. At the same time, underfunding and poor support from communist party leaderships frustrated these efforts. Factional struggles, which eventually saw Kouyate and George Padmore, Ford's successor as leader of the ITUCNW, jettisoned from communist circles further hurt efforts. Also, many black delegates faced racism, whether from neighbours in Hamburg or between African American and African comrades in meetings in Moscow. (27) 
		 Taking a closer look at the ECCI and European communist parties 
		 For every party, the politsecretariat of the ECCI provided tactical guidance and reminded them of the important tasks facing them. The ECCI took upon itself to correct what it felt were wrong approaches for parties and highlighted weaknesses for given parties. As a result, the politsecretariat's messages should showcase some consideration of how to improve colonial work, if, in fact, these parties struggled in their efforts and the Comintern prioritised it. 
		 A review of the politsecretariat documents to the British and French parties highlights the decline of colonial affairs as a prominent issue in its dealings with each party. While there were general reminders of the wider fight against imperialism, fears expressed of the impending imperialist war, and details of developments in major colonies, ECCI correspondence focused on pressing domestic issues for each party. Frequent topics included the CPGB's relationship to the Labour Party, communist tactics for British and French general elections, and the rooting out of deviationists. In the case of the British party, the Comintern was concerned over its small membership base, roughly 7,700 in February 1934, which was the party's highest membership since 1926. Colonial affairs were a generalised topic, if at all mentioned outside of a handful of letters or resolutions. 
		 In instances where colonial affairs were the focal point, the differences between the ECCI's approach to the British and French parties are notable. In June 1930, the Secretariat of the ECCI sent a note to the CPGB urging it to increase its efforts with the British Section of the LAI. The note had a distressing tone, suggesting the LAI's 'very existence' was threatened if its sections did not take on important work more quickly. It continued, stating that the section had not yet discussed the resolutions of the 1929 Frankfurt Congress and was entirely based in London, limiting its effectiveness across Great Britain. The note then proceeded to delineate a series of suggestions repeating Arnot's concerns and resembling the Madiar theses, without citing either. In particular, the ECCI wanted the British Section of the LAI to become the primary mover for colonial work in Britain, hosting a conference in London with representatives from colonial student groups when manageable. Much as Madiar had highlighted the importance of student groups, as had the Sixth Congress, a substantial portion of the Secretariat's note was dedicated to migrant students. Furthermore, it repeated the familiar refrain of needing better contact with colonial representatives and publishing news from the colonies regularly in British party press. In an effort to ensure the CPGB did not ignore this advice, the Secretariat requested that receipt be acknowledged, discussions on these issues happen as soon as possible and for the party to submit a report on the results of them. (28) Later that year, the ECCI still chided the CPGB to do more about colonial issues and to make it a core task of the party, instead of a 'departmental task'. (29) In both documents, the ECCI neglected to explicitly mention work among blacks. 
		 The stress on colonial issues ended soon thereafter, with any mention watered down into a general attack on either British imperialism or the Labour Government of Ramsay MacDonald. Secretariat advice on elections focused on domestic issues where colonial affairs were implicit--through a general attack on British imperialism, the context that defined much of Comintern approaches to Great Britain. (30) By 1933 and 1934, colonial issues vanished from the Secretariat's resolutions and correspondence, as a better relationship with the Labour Party occupied the Secretariat's attention. In fact, beyond some informational resolutions on the 1932 Ottawa Conference, the politsecretariat was willing to overlook colonial issues for a greater domestic windfall. (31) 
		 Whereas the CPGB was occasionally reminded of a need to do more, the ECCI sent the PCF a resolution passed by the politsecretariat on 16 October 1929 that tempered Comintern criticism while including the recommendations of both Arnot and Ford. Highlighting France's position as the second-largest imperial power and likely rivalry with Britain, the resolution placed a 'colossally increasing' importance on the PCF's colonial work and the work of communists in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. The ECCI commended the French communists, stating the party had 'accomplished a good deal in its work in the colonies and on the colonial problem in general'. In fact, the politsecretariat argued, the PCF's trade union work 'may serve as an example worthy of study and imitation by the other Sections of the CI'. Immediately after, however, the politsecretariat said the PCF's work had recently declined 'because of objective reasons', noting lower numbers in communist organisations in French colonies and highlighting the limited connections the PCF had with Northern African colonies. (32) The remainder of the resolution echoed previous recommendations made by Arnot and Ford: develop colonial cadres, publish information in party press, create a 'negro sub-section' and make the LDRN 'act'. Finally, much as the ECCI had with the CPGB, it recalled previous issues with communication stemming from Arnot's trip, adding in its final point, 'that contact between the colonial department of the CC [PCF] and the Eastern Secretariat of the ECCI was extremely unsatisfactory...' Compared to the critical tone of the previous reports, including Haywood's published that same month, it seemed that the French communists were doing some good work. Whereas Arnot and Ford suggested that the PCF was at least in a better position than other parties, the politsecretariat's tone was more complimentary, and its laudatory comments stand out. (33) Much of the focus of the resolution reflected a general interest in North Africa that had begun a year earlier and emphasised many of the same regions and issues. (34) Regardless, if significant work needed to be done, the politsecretariat felt restating the recommendations of Arnot and Ford would be enough. Further communication placing emphasis on colonial or 'negro' work did not follow. Apparently the 'colossal importance' of these issues was short-lived. Naturally, as the decade continued, domestic issues, such as dealing with the National Government and deviationists, took centre stage for the ECCI. With the success of the Popular Front government, ECCI attention to the French Empire faded from view. (35) One notable exception was a report of the French Section of International Red Aid's work in French colonies in 1933. (36) 
		 The interactions the ECCI had with the communist parties of the Netherlands and Belgium took on a much different tenor. Regarding Holland, the ECCI criticised the CPH for its efforts in Indonesia, again arguing the European party was not doing enough for its colonial counterpart, repeating this message for the remainder of the Third Period. For the ECCI, Indonesia's exploitation was an important element of international imperialism and the economic crisis was only going to hurt the colony further. In February 1930, the ECCI attacked the CPH for its rightist tendencies and general passivity to work on the Indonesian campaign and towards Indonesian issues in Dutch circles. The politsecretariat lamented that it had frequently castigated the CPH for its failures. It called for the party to promote Indonesian independence and to 'make support a daily issue for the party'. Practical work was necessary. The ECCI again reminded the party of its need to do more in April 1932 and in 1933. (37) 
		 The CPB received the most attention from the ECCI regarding national and colonial affairs. The ECCI initially focused on the Congo. In January 1929, before the trips of Arnot and Ford, the ECCI politsecretariat highlighted the CPB's negligence of colonial issues. (38) By August 1929, the ECCI took aim at the CPB's messaging in its propaganda on the Congo, complaining that it focused too much on the Congo's white workers. The CPB should devote more attention to black workers, the ECCI said. (39) By 1932, it applauded the progress the party had made with regard to work on the Congo, highlighting growing contact with the Congo and its proletariat. But the politsecretariat again took issue with the party's messaging. The CPB had taken a 'humanitarian approach', highlighting a need to improve conditions in the Congo, instead of focusing on class exploitation and developing a united front of workers to expose Belgian imperialism. (40) The Belgian party seemed to improve its work as, after the aforementioned trips, the ECCI never criticised the party for a lack of work, focusing instead on its content. 
		 The ECCI did criticise the CPB for its lack of effort on the Flemish Question, the term given to Flemish self-determination. In fact, the politsecretariat gradually became more preoccupied with this campaign, dedicating more space to outlining a full platform and appropriate tactics for the CPB. The ECCI outlined Flemish independence as a key issue for the party in January 1929, as Arnot and Ford were making their trips. (41) In the August 1929 resolution, the ECCI noted the party's 'hesitation' to support the Flemish Question. The ECCI called on the party to demand self-determination for Flemish peoples and instruction in native languages. (42) By 1933, it tied the Flemish and Congo campaigns together, with the Flemish movement taking precedence. Both campaigns used similar slogans and the ultimate goal for the CPB was to use the Flemish Question and independence for the Congo to bring down fascism and the Versailles system. (43) By 1934, the Congo disappeared from ECCI dictates, yet the Flemish Question remained important, concerned that Flemish separatists would turn to fascism to reach their aims. (44) 
		 The interaction between the ECCI and the four parties shows that no consistency existed in its approach to colonial work or work amongst blacks in western European communist parties outside of an initial motivation to correct it. All four parties received resolutions from the Politsecretariat that urged them to do more for the colonial world in 1929 and into 1930. The ECCI's concern over the shortcomings of French and British communism dropped off by the end of 1930 and, from then on, only casual and vague mentions remained. For Holland, the ECCI initially seemed concerned about Indonesia before that interest tapered off as the 1930s passed. In the case of Belgium, the ECCI focused on criticising the party's domestic efforts regarding Flemish separatism, instead of its effort as a whole on the Congo, and there, it was concerned more by the CPB's messaging. Attention to the Congo disappeared by 1934. All four parties, however, saw the Comintern leadership devote greater attention to their domestic issues. 
		 The Comintern's weakening prioritization of European colonial work 
		 By the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935, Comintern concerns over European colonial work seemed to end. Outside of vague mentions of a need for a broad anti-imperialist united front and support for colonial liberation movements, there were no public critiques of the efforts of Western European parties. In fact, the Congress's resolutions contained virtually nothing of substance on the issue for European parties to do, and no reminders of their alleged past inability or failures in colonial or black work. When mentioned, colonial work was important for colonial parties but it was only a part of the broader campaign against fascism. (45) If a propaganda value existed in criticising a lack of colonial work more forcefully in European parties, it was forgone for broader tactical considerations. 
		 This was part of a growing de-prioritisation within the Comintern of these anti-colonial campaigns. The LAI ceased to function as a legitimate force by 1933, as attention shifted to the League Against War and Fascism. The ITUCNW struggled in the mid-1930s and dealt with its own factional issues when George Padmore was forced out of the Comintern, and the organisation's Hamburg offices were raided. Although the Comintern placed Otto Huiswood as its head and attempted to revive the ITUCNW, it essentially existed only in name and, in 1937, it folded. In the official Comintern journal, Communist International, most articles in the late 1930s on imperialism and colonialism focused on Europe and were predominantly written with an ear to the impending imperialist war and the broader attack on fascism. Simply put, the priorities of the Comintern shifted. For all of the attention given to colonial work and black work in the Third Period, especially its first half, European diplomacy, fascism, the growing isolation of the Soviet Union, and the many factional struggles in international communism took most of the Comintern's attention by the mid-1930s. (46) 
		 But that only confirms that the Comintern did shift its priorities by 1935. What about those fateful trips by Arnot and Ford and their limited effects? A renewed flurry of attention for colonial and racial affairs came out of the Sixth Comintern Congress with its new approach, and an attempt to undermine European imperialism. But as noted earlier, this article is meant to be a starting point. What is clear from the documents is that the Comintern only seemed to be interested in motivating Western European parties, as a whole, to place more attention on colonial or black workers within their nations and on building links with colonial parties for a brief period of time. For Britain and France, that was until the end of 1930; for the Netherlands and Belgium, it lasted longer, but still maintained a more domestic focus. Why the shift? Was it because Comintern officials were convinced that the Great Depression shifted the battleground back to Europe, while the Soviet Union doubled down on its rhetoric to catch up with the Western powers with rapid industrialisation? Was the shift to domestic affairs a result of the general anti-foreign campaigns that typified the Cultural Revolution, rooting out spies, deviationists, and international wreckers, exemplified by the Industrial Party Trial of late 1930 which claimed Britain and France were using Russian specialists to destroy Soviet industry? As a result, the instability of European governments became a much more important target, regardless of the potential of campaigns in India, China, Indochina and elsewhere. Many historians have argued that by 1935, the Comintern became a tool of Soviet foreign policy, falling in line with Moscow explicitly and losing its revolutionary focus. (47) This argument bears some legitimacy as the communist leadership turned elsewhere, with plenums and publications focusing predominantly on Japanese imperialism, Italian imperialism and, eventually, Nazi Germany. One only needs to examine the Seventh Congress to notice how discussions of the National and Colonial Question were limited to India, China, Abyssinia and Brazil, all a result of reacting to international events. But the ECCI politsecretariat correspondence examined in this article suggests that this shift took place firmly in the Third Period. Does that lead to further reconsiderations of Comintern tactics and change our understanding of the Comintern and the national, colonial and racial questions broadly? Could this mean that the communist movement never had a true opportunity to implement its lofty goals, presuming the Comintern legitimately sought to pursue them, with new challenges and factors altering the movement's priorities? 
		 Meanwhile, it seems safe to suggest that in Western Europe, the ECCI, and these communist parties, prioritized domestic affairs. Although during the Third Period, many figures within the Comintern developed transnational networks across Europe or the black Atlantic, emphasised by the efforts of the many organisations highlighted earlier, and the transnational campaigns where communists played leading roles, the parties always seemed to be reluctant, or distracted, supporters. The reasons why could be many. By 1931, the Great Depression was in full swing. Europe could be ripe for revolution in the right conditions as all of the imperial powers experienced difficulties. This realisation would explain why the ECCI retreated from its attention to colonial affairs in 1931 in France and Britain. For the parties of the Netherlands and Belgium, their proximity to Nazi Germany in 1933 may be the impetus for the change. Hitler's rise, coupled with the continued collapse of Indonesian efforts in the early 1930s, explains a gradual downplaying of Indonesian issues in Dutch communist affairs. (48) The ECCI's instructions to the Communist Party of Belgium make this shift clearer as issues in the Congo drifted away and Flemish concerns remained important. Any foothold to limit the spread of fascism was more important than European-colonial collaboration. On this latter point, there is more evidence; both the Welsh and Scottish national questions became important to communists on the British Isles in the late 1930s, encouraged by the Comintern, and specifically seeking to undermine fascist movements. (49) But there is another item to highlight: could the party leaderships simply be reinforcing their biases, namely their inability, or unwillingness, to deal with racial inequality at home as Makalani argues? European parties either did not see it as a problem they needed to deal with, or they refused to consider racial issues as important as class ones. (50) These biases undoubtedly would also extend to anti-colonial work. When one considers that the Comintern apparatus, which tended to be filled by European representatives, did the leadership then just echo these biases? 
		 Undoubtedly, much more investigation needs to be done and this author hopes that by asking some of these questions and highlighting some of these machinations in this article, future historians can more firmly determine why. Taking a transnational and comparative approach brings new trends to light or reconsiders old information from a new angle. In this case, there was a gradual shift away, emphasising certain local issues, that also defined the ECCI's responses, or lack thereof, to this apparent problem of work in the colonial or the black proletariat. But this also exposes another inconsistency. At the same time that the ECCI was responding to the parties of Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, its leadership was involved deeply in the evolution of the Communist Party of South Africa through the implementation of the Native Republic Thesis, and intervening in communist parties in the Americas, namely the CPUSA, but also Latin American parties, calling on them to reconsider racial affairs in their respective countries. And as I have pointed out in other research, the Comintern failed to respond to the plight of indigenous peoples in Canada. It moved on from the Australian context, leaving that party's response to be almost fully home-grown, while very tepidly approaching the Communist Party of New Zealand to respond to oppression suffered by Maori and Samoan peoples. (51) More needs to be explored with regard to what motivated Comintern responses by looking not only locally or globally, but transnationally and through comparative lenses. Exposing these general trends which can be identified across multiple national communist parties is one step, but what that means still needs further analysis.

		ENPNewswire-February 7, 2020--Total - Fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results Strong cash flow growth in a less favorable environment Dividend increased by 5% for the year 
		 (C)2020 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 06022020 - Total's Board of Directors met on February 5, 2020, to approve the Group's 2019 financial statements.
		Commenting on the results, Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne said: 'The Group reported solid fourth quarter 2019 results with cash flow (DACF) of 7.4 B$, an increase of more than 20% compared to the fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted net income stable at 3.2 B$, despite a lower price environment. 
		 In 2019, the Group generated cash flow of 28.5 B$, strong growth of 2.4 B$ compared to 2018, thanks to a positive contribution from all segments.

		 Analysis of business segments

		 Tax on adjusted net operating income / (adjusted net operating income - income from equity affiliates - dividends received from investments - impairment of goodwill + tax on adjusted net operating income). 
		 Excluding financial charges, except those related to leases. 
		 Exploration &amp; Production adjusted net operating income was: 2,031 M$ in the fourth quarter 2019, an increase of 3% year-on-year driven by the increase in production. 
		 7,509 M$ for 2019, a decrease of 12% linked to lower Brent and gas prices. 
		 Operating cash flow before working capital changes was 4.5 B$ in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14% compared to last year, and 18.0 B$ in 2019 an increase of 1% compared to 2018. The start-up of strong cash flow generating projects offset the impact of lower Brent and gas prices. 
		 The Group's equity production may be sold by Total or by the joint ventures. 
		 Production growth over the year was essentially linked to the start-up of Ichthys in Australia in the third quarter 2018 and the successive start-ups of Yamal LNG trains in Russia. 
		 In the fourth quarter 2019, LNG sales increased by 35% year-on-year thanks to the ramp-up of Yamal LNG and Ichthys plus the start-up of the first Cameron LNG train in the US. 
		 In 2019, LNG sales increased by 57% compared to 2018 for the same reasons and also due to the acquisition of the Engie portfolio of LNG contracts in the third quarter 2018. 
		 Driven by strong LNG sales growth, operating cash flow before working capital changes for the iGRP segment more than doubled in the fourth quarter 2019 and increased by 81% in 2019. 
		 Adjusted net operating income was 794 M$ in the fourth quarter 2019, an increase of 17%, and 2,389 M$ in 2019, a decrease of 1%, impacted by lower gas prices in Europe and Asia as well as higher DD&amp;A expenses on new projects. 
		 Downstream (Refining &amp; Chemicals and Marketing &amp; Services) 
		 Adjusted net operating income for the Refining &amp; Chemicals segment decreased by 36% to 580 M$ in the fourth quarter 2019 and by 11% in 2019 to 3,003 M$, notably due to a decrease of around 10% in refining and petrochemical margins as well as lower throughput. 
		 Operating cash flow before working capital changes was 789 M$ in the fourth quarter 2019 and 4,072 M$ in 2019, a decrease of 38% and 7%, respectively, compared to 2018, for the same reasons. 
		 Marketing &amp; Services 
		 Sales of petroleum products increased by 2% in 2019, thanks notably to business development in the African and American regions, notably Mexico and Brazil. 
		 Adjusted net operating income was 474 M$ in the fourth quarter 2019, an increase of 42%, notably due to a revaluation of futures contracts. Adjusted net operating income was 1,653 M$ in 2019.

<titre>Sephora chain sees the chic in bricks and mortar LVMH unit lifts sales fourfold over eight years as it bucks trend with store renovations</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW</auteur>
<texte>
		It is lunchtime in <mention id="1770">La Défense business district in Paris</mention>, and <meronyme id="1771">the Sephora store</meronyme> is full of shoppers browsing through its high-end make-up and beauty collections. 
		 One young woman is testing out lipstick colours on a virtual mirror; another completes a touchscreen questionnaire to find the perfume that best reflects her desires. She plumps for a bottle of Dior's J'Adore and takes it to the personalisation counter for engraving.
		Like its stores in New York's Times Square and Dubai Mall in the Middle East, Sephora in <mention id="1772">La Défense</mention> has recently reopened after an extensive refurbishment. The investment reflects how bricks and mortar and experiential retail are vital to Sephora's growth. The LVMH-owned group, which stocks about 300 brands alongside its own label, has increased sales fourfold in the past eight years, fuelled by a booming beauty market. 
		 "A lot of people are scared of the retail apocalypse so they're not investing in stores, and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," said chief executive Chris de Lapuente in an interview on the shop floor. "We're investing in our stores, taking our top 100 stores in the world and renovating them to the best possible standard." 
		 The global cosmetics market was worth $532bn in 2017 and is expected to grow more than 7 per cent a year to $806bn by 2023, according to Orbis Research. 
		 LVMH on Wednesday said that likefor-like sales at the selective retailing division that Sephora is part of rose 8 per cent to €7.1bn in the first six months of the year. Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimates that the beauty group accounts for about 60 per cent of the unit's sales, and has a profit margin of 12-13 per cent. Sephora is LVMH's second-largest brand by sales. 
		 Mr de Lapuente says one attraction of Sephora is that consumers "discover brands they can't find anywhere else", noting that about one-third of its offerings are exclusive to Sephora, and it acts as an incubator for up and coming or niche brands. 
		 Exclusivity might be with Huda, which began selling false eyelashes in Dubai and subsequently developed a collaboration with Sephora; pop star Rihanna's cosmetics brand Fenty, which is on track for €500m sales this year.; or an exclusive collaboration with Dior for the Dior Backstage range of make-up. 
		 Pointing to the beauty bar where customers can get a free makeover, Mr de Lapuente added: "Experiential retail is crucial to our success. Sephora is a place where people come for advice, they come to listen. We teach, inspire and play ... You're not going to get this online. Online you can do your research ... here you can come and experiment." 
		 Mr Fujimori agrees, saying Sephora "successfully combines experiential retail with a leading ecommerce presence, leveraging digital technology to enhance the shopping experience instore and online". 
		 The challenge now for Sephora is to stay ahead in a world where there are more make-up and beauty brands than ever and social media has lowered barriers to entry and boosted the speed to market. Meanwhile, Amazon last month announced the launch of its professional beauty stores, aimed at the mass market. "Amazon is just another one of the many choices out there," said Mr de Lapuente. "They have a strong ecommerce offering. They don't have stores. We love that consumers love to shop online and in-store." He says that customers who buy both onand offline tend to purchase three times more than those who buy using just one channel. Ecommerce represents an average of 20 per cent of sales in each country for Sephora, which uses influencers to build its community. "Amazon just forces us to raise our game." 
		 Mr de Lapuente, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, joined Sephora as chief executive in 2011. It has since launched in 14 new markets, including Mexico, Brazil and Malaysia and now has 2,600 stores in 35 countries, opening them at a rate of up to 150 a year. 
		 The priority, however, is Asia — "a fantastic opportunity" according to Mr de Lapuente — where sales are growing 20 per cent a year, and 30 per cent in China. Asia's younger consumers, its growing middle class and a high interest in prestige beauty are attractive, and this year Sephora will open stores in Hong Kong and South Korea. The region accounts for roughly 15 per cent of overall sales. 
		 Despite Sephora's increasingly international footprint, it is small or absent in some key markets. It re-entered Germany in 2017, and has no presence in the UK — having pulled out a few years ago — or Japan. 
		 "They're opportunities for one day," said Mr de Lapuente. 
		 The pressure is on to keep innovating. 
		 "Beauty is so fast-moving, you can't cruise," said Mr de Lapuente. 
		 He says innovation will come both from new products (citing untapped potential in haircare and wellness), and from the way brands reach consumers. He sees opportunities in areas such as voice-activated ordering through home assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, and social commerce through platforms such as China's WeChat. 
		 But despite such technological developments, for Mr de Lapuente, the store has a robust future. 
		 At <mention id="1773">La Défense</mention>, customers are returning to work with Sephora's distinctive striped bags modelled on the black-andwhite stripes of Italy's Siena Cathedral. "Is physical retail alive or dead?" mused Mr de Lapuente among the throng of shoppers. "It looks pretty alive to me. The store is where the magic happens." 
		 The market for cosmetics was $532bn in 2017 and is expected to grow 7% a year to $806bn by 2023

<titre>Carrots and sticks burnish Parisian pitch as EU financial centre</titre>
<auteur>PATRICK JENKINS</auteur>
<texte>
		Milan's pitch to City of London institutions last week would have been comic if it wasn't so tragic. Bizarrely, the lobbying arm of Italy's financial centre chose to arrive for their charm offensive only days after the country's referendum on controversial constitutional reforms, which prime minister Matteo Renzi lost, plunging Italian politics - and its financial sector - into mayhem. 
		 If ever there was a chance of a big finance group shifting operations to Italy, now was not the time to press the case.
		Other eurozone rivals, by contrast, have been upping their game. Paris, in particular, appears to have enjoyed a surge of interest. In recent weeks, several asset managers have said privately that they might well choose Paris over rival centres such as Dublin, Luxembourg or Frankfurt if Brexit ends up being "hard", and necessitates the establishment of a new EU hub. 
		 That is a U-turn from even a few months ago when City financiers were as dismissive of Paris's merits as they were of the tortured advertising slogan for <mention id="1778">its La Defense business district</mention> (" Tired of the fog ? Try the Frogs! Choose <mention id="1779">Paris La Defense</mention>"). 
		 So what is new? The political sea change has been the most obvious factor. Ever since François Fillon triumphed last month to become the centre-right candidate for May's presidential election, the man who served as prime minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy from 2007 to 2012 has been feted as France's likely next president (assuming he is not toppled by National Front candidate Marine Le Pen). 
		 The current president, Socialist François Hollande, is not only disliked at home (his approval rating is just 4 per cent) but has long been regarded with suspicion in the City. His threat of a 75 per cent wealth tax, though never implemented, was enough to repel high-earning individuals and employers alike. Mr Fillon would be a breath of fresh air for business, with promises to raise working-hour limits and grant companies €40bn of tax breaks . 
		 At the same time, <mention id="1780">the Paris financial centre</mention> lobby has moved on from weather-based jibes. Already there are attractive personal tax breaks for returning French nationals and foreign labour - with up to half of pay exempt from income tax for five years. The current government is offering to extend that to eight years and make "inpatriation bonuses" tax-free - benefits that financiers believe a Fillon government would preserve and maybe even further enhance. 
		 Alongside the big carrots is a fairly sizeable stick - particularly for those asset managers who are professing a sudden fondness for all things French. The Paris lobby's pitch book contains an ominous page warning that UK-based asset managers who think their European business model is "Brexit-proof" may well be mistaken. 
		 The two main EU directives (Ucits and AIFMD) currently used by asset managers to sell cross-border allow funds to be administered from locations such as Dublin, Luxembourg and Paris, but with fund managers in London under so-called "delegation" rules. The pitch book warns that "the current permissive structure for EU funds may not last". The likely greater use of delegation rules by UK funds post-Brexit "may become a great concern for European regulators", such as (Paris-based) securities watchdog Esma. 
		 No wonder there is chatter that the likes of Fidelity are considering shifting large chunks of their workforce to another EU financial centre such as Paris. France's Amundi, Europe's biggest listed fund manager, is doing its bit for the cause. It now has €1.3tn of assets under management, making it the world's number eight, after striking a deal yesterday to acquire Italy's Pioneer for €3.5bn. 
		 Most bankers are probably less enamoured of Paris. HSBC might be the exception. It warned in February that in the event of Brexit it could move 1,000 staff from London to Paris, where it owns CCF. Now the drip-drip seems to have begun. The group has not announced any mass migration, and will hold off from anything dramatic at least until Brexit negotiations progress. But insiders report that certain investment banking roles, particularly those held by French nationals, have begun to move from London to Paris. 
		 The draw for HSBC is not just the natural efficiency of having a ready-made subsidiary operation in the city. If the rumour mill is right, Henri de Castries - current board member and one-time favourite to succeed Douglas Flint as chairman - will soon be France's finance minister.

		10.15184/aqy.2016.174 This paper focuses on evidence from firewood remains from a Napoleonic camp located at Etaples (in the north of France), inhabited between 1803 and 1805. The combination of archaeological and relevant historical records indicates that wood resources, stockpiled for lighting and heating by the soldiers, may have originated from two distinct areas: the army's official forest and also the area around the camp, indicating possible difficulties in wood supply at the end of its occupation. This study, therefore, uses archaeological charcoal to reinforce military historical sources in understanding firewood economy and the harsh everyday life of the Napoleonic soldier at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Keywords: France, Etaples, Napoleonic era, firewood, charcoal, anthracology
		Introduction 
		 Charcoal fragments are ubiquitous at many archaeological sites. They most often correspond to firewood used by humans for domestic and other specific combustion activities, or to timber in the case of burnt houses. Anatomical criteria allow the identification of the taxa from which the archaeological charcoal originates using a reflected-light microscope, an identification atlas and reference collections of modern charcoal. In archaeobotanical research, the main goals of archaeological charcoal analysis, or anthracology, is to understand forest history and its exploitation, as well as the use of wood by past societies (Chabal 1992, 1997; Asouti &amp; Austin 2005; Marguerie &amp; Hunot 2007; Salavert &amp; Dufraisse 2014). 
		 Since the mid 1960s, a branch of archaeology has developed in the USA that focuses on the study of the material remains of military camps of the American Civil War (Smith 1994). Similarly, in Europe, although traditionally considered more the domain of historians, the period from the eighteenth century onwards has become the subject of archaeological research in France (Buchli &amp; Lucas 2001). The archaeology of recent historical conflicts is now in full development, as shown by the fieldwork carried out on the battlefield of Waterloo (Scott &amp; McFeaters 2011; Bosquet et al. 2014; Waterloo Uncovered 2015). Rescue excavations in northern France have unearthed numerous remains from armed conflicts, such as those of the Great War (1914-1918). Archaeological analyses have not only affirmed historical sources but have also, on occasion, contradicted them (Desfosses et al. 2009; Bellan &amp; Journot 2011). Nevertheless, archaeobotany, and anthracology in particular, is still rarely applied to recent historical periods. 
		 Yet issues concerning firewood acquisition and the economic value of wood resources during archaeologically recent periods are just as relevant as they are for earlier periods. Indeed, until very recently, wood was the main resource used by humans to produce fire for heating, lighting and cooking in Western Europe. Moreover, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, forests played a major role in military strategy by providing building material for ships, weapons, barracks and other facilities for the army (Brosse 2000). In order to manage the land better and prevent deforestation, a law was passed in 1803, proposed by Napoleon, that established strict controls over forest clearance by civilians; it laid the foundation for future forest legislation later in nineteenth-century France (Reitel 1994). Charcoal fragments from archaeological contexts are able, therefore, to provide the most direct evidence of firewood used by soldiers of the period. Anthracology is well placed to provide these reliable data, which can add to the information provided in nineteenth-century historical sources, especially with regard to past woodland composition and forest management practices. 
		 This paper focuses on the firewood remains from a Napoleonic camp located at Etaples in the north of France. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to apply anthracology to an archaeological site attributed to the eighteenth century in Europe (Hello 2013). The work is part of a wider archaeological project led by the French National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) that aims to understand the everyday living conditions of the soldiers, including those of the Grande Armee in the early nineteenth century (Lemaire 2010, 2013, 2015). By comparing the archaeological charcoal to evidence provided from historical sources, this paper aims to examine the global potential of anthracology for enhancing the current knowledge of historical forest exploitation. Specifically, it aims to understand firewood management by Napoleonic troops in greater detail through charcoal analysis. Did the supply of firewood, as evidenced through the archaeological charcoal, accurately reflect that which was noted in the official military records? Were there any differences in firewood use according to hierarchical rank within the army? 
		 The Napoleonic camps: historical background and archaeological context 
		 Historical background 
		 In 1803, the army known as the Cotes de l'Ocean, formed by Napoleon, was intending to invade England, following the breaking of the peace treaty signed the previous year. He gathered together a large army and stationed it in the Boulogne camps located on the French and Belgian coasts of the English Channel, as well as on the Dutch coast of the North Sea (Dumas 1822a &amp; b; Battesti 2003a &amp; b; Bonaparte &amp; Navarro 2004). Between 1803 and 1805, around 175 000 soldiers were routinely gathered and trained for the planned invasion of England. In late August 1805, the army left the camps for Germany. In October of that year, the French fleet, commanded by Admiral Villeneuve, was totally destroyed at Trafalgar, marking the end of the Napoleonic invasion project. In 1810, the Boulogne camps were finally abandoned (Masson 1995). 
		 The 'Boulogne camps' is a general term used to qualify the camps collectively at sites such as Saint-Omer, Bruges and Montreuil, located on the English Channel coast and the North Sea (Figure 1). These camps benefited from their close vicinity to port facilities, as well as having access to the wood resources of the Boulonnais forests. The camps of Montreuil were settled in the mouth of the Canche River in a landscape composed of dunes and marshes (Figure 1). They comprised three infantry divisions: Camiers, Tubersent and Etaples. The latter, occupied from October 1803 to August 1805, was stationed by more than 6000 soldiers distributed across four regiments. According to various historical sources, three of the four regiments benefited from approximately 139ha of available land around the camp, including 25ha of land damaged by previous military installations in the Canche delta (Lemaire 2015). 
		 The camps were composed of multiple lines of barracks, organised according to battle order on the battlefield (Figure 2). The living conditions in the camp were unhealthy and marked by overcrowding, especially in winter. Barracks consisted of half-buried shelters, built with daub and covered with a straw roof set down on two earthen embankments. In these barracks, which were usually much smaller than 20[m.sup.2], 12-16 men were sheltered (Hiriart 1804; Roguet 1864; Montesquiou-Fezensac 1870). 
		 Archaeological context 
		 The camp of the 69th Regiment of the Etaples infantry division was discovered thanks to a rescue excavation overseen by INRAP in 2010, prior to the construction of an urban development zone at Etaples. The camp, covering 5ha, was almost entirely excavated during a period of six months (Figure 2). 
		 A total of 191 barracks were discovered (Lemaire 2009, 2010), the majority of which were in a remarkable state of preservation. One hundred and eighty-two of them were excavated. The 69th Regiment, under the direction of a chief, consisted of two battalions (north and south) with several rows of barracks corresponding to six military ranks (Figure 2). For each battalion, directed by a colonel, the troops' barracks, spreading over three lines, were the most numerous. The battalion itself was composed of nine companies; each company being comprised of nine troop barracks and a kitchen, under the direction of three officers who were accommodated separately, behind the kitchen. The barracks of the fifth line were intended, in theory, to house surgeons and general staff, but their function seems more complex and probably also had a collective recreational use: mess room, dance floor, fencing room and the like. 
		 The camp of the 69th Regiment therefore appears to have been built according to the ministerial directions and military regulations that standardised barrack size and camp layout (Narbonne-Lara 1792; Bardin 1813). The archaeological excavation did, however, highlight some diversity in the building techniques used and in the internal organisation within the barracks (Figure 3). A small proportion of the buildings comprised rubble and chalk-stone building materials, and contained features corresponding to postholes that had once supported a roof made of vegetal matter (Figure 3). The officers' barracks were all equipped with a fireplace, whereas the soldiers' barracks did not, generally, have any means of heating. The kitchen dimensions were different in size to other buildings in the barracks, and that may indicate more specific uses: sometimes smaller, they contained one or several large masonry chimneys per building. 
		 Around 6000 archaeological artefacts were discovered, including uniform buttons, gun parts, coins, razors, lice combs, couture scissors, pipes made of burnt clay, crockery, metal nails, furniture parts and so on. These diverse objects all relate to different aspects of daily camp life, and mainly originated from the troops' barracks. 
		 Charcoal analysis 
		 Material and method 
		 Analysis focused on charcoal-rich sediments from the stratigraphic layers in which human activity occurred: the barrack floors and chimney fireplaces of 16 entirely excavated buildings (Figure 2). The presence of charcoal on the floors of the troops' barracks suggests that at least some of the soldiers made use of small domestic fireplaces. The sampling contexts may correspond to their final firings for heating and cooking at the end of the camp occupation, between 1803 and 1805. During the excavation, 100 soil samples comprising approximately 1300L of sediment were sieved in water through 2mm and 0.5mm mesh sieves. From these, a total of 23 samples were deemed viable for further analysis on the basis of the number of charcoals present. 
		 The well-preserved archaeological charcoals were observed with a reflected-light microscope using both dark-field and bright-field illuminations (magnification x50 to xlOOO). Taxonomic identification was performed using an identification atlas (Schweingruber 1990) and the reference collection of modern charcoals. Normally, wood anatomy only allows identification to genus level. A minimum of 50 fragments were identified in each archaeological sample, and for each new taxon determined, an additional 50 fragments were again identified. For temperate Europe, this was sufficient to predict the "optimal sample size to select and study" so as to have the most complete overview of species diversity exploited for firewood in the past (Chabal 1994, 1997: 33; Salavert et al. 2014). 
		 The dataset presented variations in the number of barracks, samples and charcoal fragments identified by rank (kitchen, troop, undefined rank, officer) and battalion (north, south). These variations have to be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the wood supply varied according to location and rank. For example, the most substantial charcoal assemblages come from the kitchens (seven barracks) and troop accommodations (six barracks). Only one barrack of the fifth line, attributed to an undefined rank, and two officers' barracks were investigated (Figure 2; Table 1). There are two principal reasons to explain these quantitative differences. Firstly, troop barracks are the most numerous within a battalion. Thus, there was an increased chance that they would deliver more ash-rich deposits favourable to anthracological analysis than others. Secondly, the kitchens, as the largest firewood consumers, were expected to provide the most extensive archaeological evidence of combustion activities. The four hierarchical ranks were only fully observable in the south battalion, and, therefore, the results obtained from the undefined line had no corresponding counterpart in the north battalion. Also, the sum of the barracks and charcoal fragments studied for undefined staff and officer lines was much lower than those of the troops and kitchens. Using such a small corpus of samples could, potentially, affect the number of taxa identified and lead to over-representation of some types. No samples were taken from the colonel's barracks because of its poor preservation, nor from the two barracks of the battalion chiefs, which were destroyed by the construction of facilities during the Second World War. 
		 Results 
		 A total of 1746 charcoal fragments and 13 species were identified at Etaples (see Table SI in online supplementary material). The species were ordered according to their relative proportions calculated on the total number of fragments identified on the site, as well as the number of barracks in which each taxon was identified (i.e. occurrence) (Figure 4). Overall occurrence is important for confirming the hierarchy of species, and for counterbalancing percentages that could be over- or under-estimated due to the number of charcoals identified within the sample, or to taphonomical processes. 
		 From the charcoal assemblage, five species, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the identified fragments dominated: Carpinus, Betula, Fagus, Alnus and Salix/Populus. These species were identified in at least 12 of the 16 barracks studied. Secondary species were Ulmus, Quercus and Corylus, which represented between 3 and 2 per cent of the charcoal assemblage, and were identified in more than a quarter of the structures. Minor species included: Prunoideae (sub-family of Rosaceae including the Prunus genus), Fraxinus, cf. Maloideae (sub-family of Rosaceae including the Malus, Sorbus and Pyrus genera), Juglans and Acer. The five dominant species were similarly represented in both battalions (Figure 5): Carpinus, Betula, Fagus, Alnus and Salix/Populus. The importance of Betula may, however, have been overestimated in the north battalion due to the small number of fragments studied in the officers barrack. Among the other species, Prunoideae was not identified in the north, although this absence is regarded as irrelevant, as the taxon only formed part of the minor species. The list of species was, therefore, consistent according to grade and location. The study of the spatial distribution of charcoal assemblages did not indicate a differential wood supply by rank (kitchen, troop, undefined rank, officer) or battalion (north, south) (Figure 5). 
		 Discussion 
		 Contribution of historical records 
		 The data gathered from anthracological analysis of firewood supply in the Napoleonic camp at Etaples may be integrated with information given by primary historical sources, such as soldiers' letters, military orders and previous historical publications for a better-informed interpretation (see Table S2). Specific aspects concerning the use of wood resources and their economic value for the camps are predominantly known through letters or reports from the military to the General Staff (Hello 2013). Among them, weekly reports documented the supply of food, fodder, weapons and firewood to the camps. During this period, the wood resources provided for soldiers were controlled by the official supplier to the army who acquired 200ha of forest around the Boulogne camps to provide wood for heating and lighting services. According to the agenda of the Bruges camp, written by General Mathieu Dumas, the official wood species stockpiled by the Napoleonic army consisted of Carpinus, Fagus and Quercus. In addition to firewood, peat, coal and candle oil were also supplied to the soldiers (Chochois &amp; Poultier 2004). 
		 As the historical sources indicated the supply of only three species to the Boulogne camps, we expected to identify the equivalent from the archaeological charcoal. In contrast, the number of species identified within the charcoal assemblage comprised 13 different species. The three species noted as being supplied officially (Carpinus, Fagus and Quercus) amounted to less than half (47 per cent) of the fragments identified. Carpinus and Fagus were dominant in this charcoal assemblage (confirming their use as firewood); despite its identification in more than half of the barracks, the percentage of Quercus was surprisingly low (2 per cent). The low percentage of Quercus may be due to the composition of forests officially exploited by the army wood supplier, or from the last firewood stocks allotted to the camps. 
		 As can clearly be seen, there is a major discrepancy between the archaeological and historical sources with the identification of at least 10 unofficial species, including Betula, Alnus and Salix/Populus, which are not recorded in any official documents and yet are dominant among the charcoal assemblage (Figure 5). The results can be explained in one of two ways: either the official supply comprised more than three species, or the supply of firewood was not entirely managed by the official supplier to the Boulogne camps. 
		 Additional historical records regarding wood resource management highlight problems with the supply of firewood to the Boulogne camps. For example, in a letter of 1804, Colonel Demarcay announced an interruption of firewood distribution for eight days at the camp of St-Omer. Another letter, from the Inspecteur aux Revues to General Andreossy, and dated from the same year, raised concerns over soldiers using wood intended for the construction of the barracks for heating instead. It therefore appears that the soldiers from the Boulogne camps suffered greatly from regular firewood shortages. The archaeological evidence from Etaples may, therefore, allude to firewood gathered from the vicinity of the camp. This hypothesis is supported in letters from General Dutaillis, written in 1805, which reported significant damage to woodland adjacent to the Montreuil camps. 
		 Interpretation of archaeological charcoal assemblages 
		 In anthracology, it is generally assumed that the greater the range of species represented in a sample, the more complete the image of exploited woodland will be (Chabal 1994, 1997). At Etaples, up to 13 species were identified, of which 10 taxa did not come from the army's official stock. This number of taxa is consistent with the taxonomic diversity obtained on pre- and protohistorical sites from the north of France and Belgium (Pernaud 1997; Salavert et al. 2014). At Etaples, the majority of the archaeological samples may simply represent wood resources available from around the site, rather than a determined selection based on particular species. Thus, even if the charcoal assemblage does not provide an exhaustive list of all the available species exploited for firewood, it does at least give those used most commonly by the soldiers. 
		 The additional taxa from the charcoal assemblage may correspond to different vegetation communities. Often, within the same genus, the ecological requirements, such as water and light needs, vary depending on the species. That level of identification is, however, rarely achieved in anthracology. For example, Salix caprae can be found growing on the edge of forests and across open woodlands, whereas Salix fragilis is associated only with damp conditions such as riverbanks (Rameau etal. 1989). This can lead to sharply differing interpretations of the forest composition when analysing archaeological charcoal. In order to gain a reliable overview of the forest composition and the taxa exploited for firewood during this period, both the groups of, and typical plant characteristics for, the wood species identified in the archaeological charcoal assemblages must be taken into account. 
		 The three officially sanctioned species delivered to the camps of Boulogne probably came from mature oak-hornbeam (Carpinion betuli) or beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests located in the Boulonnais region, and managed by a supplier for the Napoleonic army. Betula, Alnus and Salix!Populus, three of the dominant additional species, and Fraxinus and Ulmus, minor and secondary species, respectively, are prominent in damp or waterlogged soils, such as riparian or swamp forests (Rameau et al. 1989) similar to those surrounding the site. The possibility that some of the additional dominant species, together with secondary or minor taxa such as Corylus, Acer, cf. Maloideae and Prunoideae, could have also come from the forest edges or degraded forests inland cannot be excluded. Episodes of war were often destructive to forested areas (Amat 1987; Dubois 1994; Reitel 1994; Puyo 2004); during the twentieth century, and possibly even earlier, disturbed soils favoured the growth of local hygrophilous vegetation to the detriment of oak-hornbeam forests in the north of France (Dubois 1994), which might explain the presence of the additional taxa at Etaples. Unfortunately, palynology, which could indicate the local and regional vegetation around Etaples, is of relatively little help to support the discussion of the charcoal data. Indeed, there are very few palynological studies of the Boulonnais recording and discussing levels throughout the nineteenth century. In the few existing studies, the absence of radiocarbon dating for the upper levels of palynological diagrams prevents the precise timing of forest dynamics (Munaut &amp; Gilot 1976; D'Hauwe 1979). 
		 Juglans was a minor species and probably not part of the local vegetation from around the camp. Indeed, this taxon is extremely sensitive to spring frosts, which would most certainly have occurred in the north of France at that time (Musset 1962; Rameau et al. 1989). The high economic value of Juglans suggests that its original use was not for heating or cooking, but rather for a secondary use as furniture or even rifle parts (Guinier 1953). The identification of Juglans in only two barracks (one kitchen and one officers barrack) indicates that this practice remains limited in the camp, and these fragments probably came from weapon parts that were beyond salvageable repair. 
		 The archaeological evidence and historical records indicate that the wood resources used for lighting, heating and cooking by the soldiers of the 69th Regiment may have had two points of origin: the army supplier, who provided the three officially listed species, and the local vicinity, from which the 10 unofficial additional species were gathered (Figure 5). As with charcoal assemblages from older archaeological sites, this wood, collected in an opportunistic manner by the soldiers, contributes to our understanding of local forest composition, probably in the Canche delta. Furthermore, the application of anthracology at Etaples highlights the importance of regular wood shortages in Napoleonic camps at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These shortages, combined with arduous living conditions, meant that by the end of the camp's occupation, soldiers were forced to collect firewood from the local vicinity for use by all ranks. 
		 Conclusion 
		 Anthracology, as a supplement to historical documents, has provided a substantial contribution to our understanding of firewood economy among Napoleonic camps, and especially to the everyday life of the Napoleonic soldier at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The additional taxa clearly correspond to wood resources collected in the vicinity of the site. These unofficial' wood collections offset the shortages recorded at the Boulogne camps due to potential transport problems or an overexploitation of the official forests themselves due to military needs, especially for shipbuilding (Boudriot 1999). In France, the forest reached its lowest geographic area around either 1816 or 1830, and the Napoleonic Wars contributed significantly to this decrease (Bainville &amp; Ladoy 1995; Dupouey et al. 2007). The application of dendrometric tools and methods to archaeological charcoals has developed considerably, and should also provide additional information on the structure of the residual woodlands exploited for firewood at the beginning of the eighteenth century. This first application of archaeological charcoal analysis to a Napoleonic military camp constitutes a good example of the potential for studying charcoal fragments from recent archaeological sites, and suggests how we may further our understanding of woodland history during historical conflicts.

<titre>The people and the workers: communist cultural politics during the popular front in France.</titre>
<auteur>MATTIE FITCH</auteur>
<texte>
		Recognising the threat posed by fascism in the 1930s, the Parti Communiste Francais (French Communist Party, PCF) curbed its sectarianism to adopt a more inclusive stance towards all antifascists and launched a powerful cultural movement. This had important implications for the working-class identity of the Communist Party and for working-class cultural life, as communists merged proletarian cultural traditions with French national heritage. (1) 
		 Historians have interpreted the popular front strategy adopted by French communists as a shelving of their revolutionary agenda. They suspended their push for a radical overthrow of the capitalist system and the establishment of a socialist society, this position argues, in order to fight fascism by joining a broad antifascist coalition that included members of the bourgeoisie. Julian Jackson writes that communists postponed 'revolutionary objectives in favour of a broad anti-fascist alliance with socialist and liberal bourgeois parties'. (2) However, an analysis of the cultural production of communists during the popular front reveals that rather than deferring it, communists reimagined their revolutionary agenda within the context of left-wing solidarity. As their cultural position shows, communists combined their goals of working-class emancipation with the fight against fascism. The push for unity among the left did not preclude continued communist commitment to class struggle. Instead, communists incorporated class struggle into the prevailing cultural concepts of the time, the national and the popular. At the heart of communist popular front cultural strategy lay a melding of national and working-class goals. A new concept of 'the people' allowed communists to cultivate this hybrid identity.
		This understanding of the communist cultural approach facilitates a reassessment of the communists' appropriation of French national symbols during this period. Historians have yet to provide a satisfactory explanation of how class and nation articulated within the communist movement. This article provides a study of communists' engagement with French cultural traditions, including those stemming from folklore, which has largely been investigated as a developing field of ethnographic study in the 1930s, rather than as a broader societal influence. (3) Communists embraced French cultural sources, whether stemming from folklore, national heritage, or the revolutionary tradition, because they construed these elements as 'popular', meaning 'of the people', the central concept of the popular front historical moment. (4) By elaborating their understanding of 'the popular', communists developed a new definition and used it in innovative ways. Through the notion of 'the popular', communists reconciled nation and class within their cultural movement. 
		 The term 'popular' carries an ambiguous definition in French. It can denote a social category of have-nots, as in the 'popular classes', but it can also designate a civic one, the group constituting the citizenry, as in the phrase 'sovereignty rested with the people'. For popular front activists, 'popular' could thus mean the entire civic body making up the nation, or those who worked for a living. The concept of the popular allowed communists and cultural figures affiliated with them to slip between these different notions and suggest both at once. By employing the idea of 'the French people', communists could refer simultaneously to a socially nebulous, unified group, and the working class. (5) I also utilise the dual definition of working population and civic body when using this term, in order to interrogate its complexities. Communists articulated two definitions of 'the people', and reconciled them by linking workers to France's revolutionary tradition. 
		 As participants in the popular front alliance, communists defined 'the people' as those inhabitants embodying the true animating spirit of France, who loved the timeless French (left-wing) ideals of liberty, equality, and justice. Rather than promoting the proletariat as they had done previously, communists adopted the concept of 'the people' to address their message to the wider group they hoped would support the coalition. (6) Activists sought to mobilise the people against the fascist threat, and employed cultural politics (cultural forms presenting political messages) to imbue the populace with French antifascist values and attitudes. Cultural engagement, they believed, could pull the people into politics by strengthening their connection to a shared community and creating a common French antifascist identity. The notion of 'the French people' as a classless fraternity united against common oppressors functioned as a crucial unifying concept for the popular front. 
		 In celebrating the French people, however, communists did not cease their focus on the working class; rather they asserted that the workers were the people. They promoted the popular front strategy of antifascist unity, and the inclusive definition of popular that supported it, but this did not mean that communists dropped their allegiance to the working class or their commitment to its emancipation. In fact, the popular front facilitated the increasing reach of communism within the working class, and marked the moment when the Communist Party captured workers' loyalty. (7) While maintaining its unifying definition, 'popular' also entered the communist lexicon as another synonym for working-class; communists used the terms workers, masses, people, and proletariat interchangeably. Communist-allied writer Romain Rolland wrote that serving 'the cause of the Social Revolution' meant entering into dialogue with 'the people', creating 'cohesion' between writers and 'the popular masses', and 'drawing closer' to 'the proletariat'. (8) The concept of 'popular' enriched communists' understandings of the cultural element of class struggle. 'Popular' in this sense denoted the working-class authenticity of cultural works and practices, contrasted to the commercial cultural products generated by the bourgeoisie as part of their class domination. The popular front cultural movement, by promoting cultural production that was popular in this sense, could free the people from capitalist cultural hegemony. 
		 Communists reconciled these seemingly contradictory definitions of popular, one nationally inclusive and one class-based, by appealing to France's revolutionary tradition. Workers, communists argued, embodied France's most essential values, and revolted when these were jeopardised. 
		 The advancement of workers therefore also protected national virtues. In wedding working-class and national cultural legacies, French communists maintained that the workers had always constituted the popular force of France, and would simultaneously defend the nation and their advancement as a class. Through their popular front cultural position, communists constructed a powerful left-wing identity with national and class foundations. Embracing both elements enabled the party to attract significant support among workers, to whom this identity appealed in particular. 
		 Other organisations within the popular front coalition endorsed different conceptions of 'the popular'. The wider popular front cultural movement, which included groups as different as working-class communists and middle-class moderates, functioned as a debate about the identity of the French people. (9) Despite the ostensible unity of the popular front, its key concept was highly contested. Republican moderates conceptualised the popular front as popular mobilisation for the Republic, during which a classless people rose up to defend their civil liberties. Unlike the communists' position, moderates' cultural approach hoped to erase class differences within a unified nation. Communists successfully integrated the multiple definitions of 'popular', but ultimately this papered over profound cultural divisions within the coalition. The ambiguity of 'the people' allowed communists to use it in innovative ways but its inherent contradictions became unbridgeable for the alliance as a whole. 
		 For the party, the communists' popular front strategy proved tremendously successful, because it broadened communist influence within the working class and allowed communists to launch a grassroots movement. However, on a national level, the strategy failed because it contributed to the disintegration of the coalition. The dual emphasis on nation and class attracted workers, but the continued class emphasis of communist cultural production alienated bourgeois moderates who adhered to the antifascist alliance to stave off the fascist threat. It was precisely because the communists had not abandoned their revolutionary agenda, and instead combined it with the antifascist project, that they repelled members of the bourgeoisie. 
		 Despite this failure, the popular front established an influential precedent for the New Left. The post-1956 'cultural turn' was not the first time communists engaged in such a cultural shift. The move away from the promotion of proletarian revolution and towards an idea of cultural transformation--hallmarks of the post-war cultural turn--also characterised the popular front period in the mid-1950s. Developments in the post-Stalin period echoed the popular front connection between a new political attitude and the mobilisation of cultural practices. (10) The French communists' cultural position during the popular front as it was elaborated in theory and practice represented an innovation. They integrated national and popular ideas with the working-class fight, and reworked them into a powerful left-wing identity. An investigation of the French communists' popular front cultural movement allows an examination of how a class-based movement responded to, participated in, and ultimately influenced a broader political, social, and cultural movement. 
		 Development of the communist popular front cultural position 
		 Prior to the popular front, French communists rejected parliamentary democracy and nationalism, instead embracing the concept of class struggle. The PCF formed in 1920, after splitting from the socialists due to differences of opinion about the Russian Revolution. The debate among steadfast socialists and future communists pitted against one another: militants 'attached to French socialist tradition' and others who wanted 'to follow the Soviet example'. (11) During the following decade, the new Communist Party drew closer to the Soviets and recruited primarily among the French working class. (12) The Communist Party's sectarian approach of attacking the other parties on the left, however, resulted in their drastically reduced influence within French politics. The 'class against class' position, condemning social democracy as comparable to fascism (both allowing the bourgeoisie to maintain its hegemony), isolated communists. Party membership and electoral votes fell precipitously, reaching their lowest point in 1931-32. (13) Nevertheless, some activists laid cultural groundwork during this period, through 'a new preoccupation by some intellectuals with the world of the worker; and a heightened preoccupation by working-class organisations with the cultural requirements of its members'. (14) The Amsterdam-Pleyel movement against war and fascism, and communist writer Henri Barbusse's periodical Monde, which proclaimed cultural education 'essential for the emancipation of the working class', outlined the antifascist cultural position that communists would espouse in 1934. (15) 
		 For several years after 1934, the Communist Party became the most dynamic party of the left. This was due to the adroit communist response to the shifting international and domestic situation engendered by the economic crisis and the rise of fascism. Right-wing riots erupted in Paris in February 1934, which the left interpreted as an attempted fascist coup. French communists reacted by adopting the popular front strategy of broad left-wing unity. Communists joined socialists and bourgeois republicans in the fight for the survival of the Republic, and grassroots antifascist momentum resulted in the election of a popular front government in 1936. (16) For the Communist Party, election results and party membership soared from 1934 to 1937, the year popular front momentum peaked. (17) Though the popular front moment passed quickly, and Party advances declined after 1938, its impact for France and French communists outweighed the shortness of its existence. 
		 During the popular front, intellectuals and artists who supported communism, rallied their peers to create a new vision for French society that could offer an antifascist alternative capable of mobilising the populace against fascism. (18) They endowed cultural life with a key role in the popular front movement. Cultural activity, communists believed, would be a primary force in bringing this new society into fruition, and the new society would give workers cultural agency. Melding new with old, communists embraced French national symbols stemming from French republican tradition as the foundation for this social rebirth. (19) 
		 The PCF's 'popular turn': embracing national culture 
		 Through their espousal of the popular, French communists embraced the national. They never questioned their allegiance to the Soviet Union, and continued to uphold it as the archetypal communist society France would one day join. However, during the popular front, the PCF rekindled home-grown communist traditions and reclaimed the French revolutionary legacy as part of communist identity. After 14 July 1935, the Communist Party's daily newspaper, L'Humanite, published at least one article a week about the French Revolution. (20) This popular front cultural position represented an about-face for the Communist Party, as members embraced French cultural traditions they had previously denounced as reactionary and militaristic, such as 'La Marseillaise'. Such national icons were now construed as popular, stemming from the heritage of the French people. As communist writer Louis Aragon explained, the people were the 'living sources of our nation'. (21) In embracing national cultural symbols, communists represented themselves as French patriots, working to protect France from fascism. It was this 'recuperation of patriotic themes' and 'elements chosen from the French revolutionary tradition and working-class culture' that resulted in an 'influx of members and the expansion of its audience'. (22) French communists rediscovered that France's revolutions were the work of the French people, and hoped to reawaken this spark. 
		 The key cultural concept of this national move--the French people --emphasised shared national left-wing values and cultural traditions that negated fascism. As part of their popular front cultural position, communists adopted French heritage as the foundation of antifascist ideology and the French people as the mobilised antifascist force. They argued that the popular front could protect national left-wing ideals such as liberty and democracy. This would be accomplished by uniting the French people through a cultural movement that simultaneously celebrated French heritage and advanced French society. Leading French communist Paul Vaillant-Couturier defined the popular front as: 
		  ... the organisation of the defence of the People against all who menace its liberties. It is the confluence of all people of goodwill in defence of the intellectual and moral values of active democracy. It plunges solid roots into French cultural traditions. It orients itself towards the acceleration of human progress.  
		 Because of France's revolutionary past, its traditions were compatible with the communist vision of the future; communist cultural activists agitated 'for the defence of French culture and revolutionary culture, which we do not separate'. (23) 
		 Cultural programs promoted shared traditions among the people. The communist popular front cultural organisation, the Association des Maisons de la Culture (Association of Cultural Centres), worked to revive or create popular cultural forms through the collaboration of left-leaning artists and the people. The people served as both the audience and the creative source of the cultural activities organised by the members of the Maisons de la Culture throughout France. Rouge Midi (Red Midi, the left-leaning southern region of France), the communist newspaper in Marseille, explained that the city's Maison 'professes that all true art has its roots in the people'. (24) Much of the Maison activists' cultural events drew on French heritage from the popular past. The Maison in Marseille saw the movement as 'a rebirth, resuscitating the best traditions of our people'. (25) Radio-Liberte (Liberty Radio), a group affiliated with the Maison de la Culture, collaborated with the communist theatre troupe Art et Travail (Art and Work) to 'make known to the people of our country the beauties of dramatic art' and to bring to the radio 'the popular voice' through their 'theatrical broadcasts'. (26) 
		 In the year following its first broadcast in 1936, Art et Travail performed fifty-one radio plays of a social bent, including works by Soviet playwright Maxim Gorki and nineteenth-century French writer Emile Zola. Radio-Liberte declared that they had received thousands of letters from listeners expressing their satisfaction with these performances. Radio-Liberte and Art et Travail members believed that broadcasting works that addressed 'the collective soul of the people' would expand the ability of the people to experience theatre by removing performances from elite spaces and enable theatre to speak to their experiences by imbuing it with popular inspiration. (27) 
		 Folklore, seen by communists as a pure artefact of local communal life, featured prominently in Maison repertoire as an authentic popular source. (28) Cultural groups affiliated with the Maison incorporated folklore into their work, such as the Chorale Populaire de Paris (Popular Chorus of Paris), who sang folksongs at many of their events. The organisers of the Chorale believed that folksongs were the essential expression of a timeless French people and performing them reconnected the contemporary French people to their traditions. In February 1938, members of the Maison-affiliated Federation Musicale Populaire (Popular Music Federation, FMP) and communist Leon Moussinac founded a new label to release audio-recordings of folksongs in order to facilitate this cultural transmission. They believed that though many folksongs had been collected by scholars, 'relatively little has been done to return the popular spirit to the popular song. We would like to reveal to the largest possible public what we consider to be a patrimony of great value'. (29) On 17 May 1938 at the Gaite-Lyrique Theatre, the label hosted its 'first great popular concert [...] devoted to folklore'. The concert debuted 'six popular songs from our provinces' arranged by contemporary composers affiliated with the FMP. (30) 
		 Communists' valorisation of French folk traditions represented the conquering of cultural territory long held as the purview of the nationalist right. Activists had the sense of rescuing French musical traditions from at best, neglect, and at worst, reactionary exploitation. Vaillant-Couturier proclaimed at the FMP annual congress of 1937, 'we have to make live again all these magnificent artistic [traditions] of our country, which find themselves often separated, isolated, cloaked in some reactionary spirit'. (31) During the popular front the left appropriated nationalist rhetoric and concepts. Composer Marcel Delannoy believed that the first duty of the FMP was 'to revive the old popular source of this country. Admirable source, as you know, that comes from the land and blood'. (32) That a left-wing activist could use such terms, strongly associated with the French right, demonstrates that during the popular front left-wing cultural militants fought the association of traditional French identity with the right. (33) They argued instead for the immemorial Frenchness of left-wing virtues. (34) In order to create an antifascist alternative to the fascist temptation, members of the left took up previously right-wing concepts and repurposed them to create a left-wing national identity. 
		 Activists believed that these French traditions lived on in the modern era. General Secretary of the FMP, Suzanne Cointe, defined folklore as 'trade songs, not only from the past but also in the present'. (35) She and her comrades rejoiced in what they perceived as the creation of a new folklore by the contemporary French people. She and others pointed to the popular front strike wave of June 1936, an unprecedented series of factory occupations, as their prime evidence of the people's spontaneous musical production. Cultural activists believed they had witnessed an instinctive outpouring of cultural production by the strikers. As Vaillant-Couturier explained: 
		  During the strikes of June, there emerged a whole folklore that we studied at the Maison de la Culture, a whole musical folklore, a whole folklore of songs. There wasn't a factory that didn't have its song, [which] represents the elan, the hope of our people, [...] through music.  
		 In his mind, 'Traditions are living things', and thus died out unless the people incorporated them into their daily lives. He continued, 'We need to give a life, and a strong life, to [France's] traditions and [...] to move forward'. (36) The communist popular front cultural movement aimed not just to resuscitate popular cultural forms from the past, but also to generate popular cultural activity suited for the current time. The Maison de la Culture undertook a 'double task: on one side a more humane comprehension and a more ample diffusion of the works of the past' and on the other 'the creation of a new art of immense possibilities'. (37) For this task, popular front communists turned to the working class. 
		 Advancing the working-class during the Popular Front 
		 Communists maintained their dedication to a working-class victory despite membership in the coalition. The growth in the Communist Party's influence that coincided with its popular front activity occurred primarily among the working class. In 1935-36, 'a large fraction of the working class recognised itself in the PCF and made it its political spokesperson, its tribune. [...] As a political party, the PCF also became the identity vector of working-class communities threatened by the [economic] crisis'. (38) Correspondingly, the Communist Party valorised its working-class identity and dedicated itself to working-class cultural advancement. Though communists professed their commitment to popular front unity, communist cultural politics during the popular front focused on the cultural emancipation of the working class. Communists envisioned investing French cultural life with working-class aesthetics and empowering workers to engage in cultural production. 
		 The Maisons de la Culture called for championing the cause of the working class through cultural means. Activists believed they could strengthen working-class activism by developing working-class cultural content and forms, as well as ensuring working-class participation in cultural activities. Cultural mobilisation would hasten the overthrow of the bourgeoisie's cultural hegemony. (39) As communists wrote in the Marseille Maison newspaper: 'The bourgeoisie has had its day. It is the working class that is called to succeed it to power, and to collect its triple heritage: political, economic, and cultural'. (40) The Maison and its associated groups fostered the creation of new artistic material and practices that 'expressed the collective conscience of the workers, their strength, their fights, and their aspirations'. (41) Artistic renovation was needed, they believed, to reflect the social conditions of the 1930s. A Federation Musicale Populaire member argued that 'The composer today [...] must create music that is commensurate with contemporary events, a music whose style and language is resonant with the current times and the great movements of the masses that characterise it'. (42) 
		 Not only should cultural production reflect the everyday reality of the workers, activists maintained, but cultural life should also serve the working-class struggle for the better society of the future. This entailed fighting the bourgeois cultural influence that communists believed depoliticised the masses who consumed commercial culture. Communist-allied writer Jean Cassou complained that 'One constantly insists on making culture a definite and fixed object that is transmitted in the manner of goods, money, and possessions'. Culture, he argued, was 'not a thing, but a future and an action'. (43) Cultural life had to be removed from the market, which was controlled by the bourgeoisie and thus a strut supporting its position of power, if culture could contribute to the ascendance of the working class. As Henri Cliquet-Pleyel, an FMP member, explained, it was necessary to 'uproot from the love that the people currently carries for music all that the egoist bourgeois culture wants to implant there to try to overwhelm them and subject them to servitudes and fascisms of all kinds'. (44) 
		 Communists within the popular front cultural movement endowed 'popular' with another meaning: the opposite of 'the commercial' or 'the bourgeois'. Through this definition, communists developed ideas about the need to fight bourgeois hegemony by generating working-class cultural life that would advance workers' emancipation. In its review of a 1937 Chorale Populaire de Paris performance of revolutionary songs in Rouen, the local communist newspaper wrote, 'Yes, we want and we create an Art of the People, for there are among the workers infinite possibilities, a richness and a freshness of sentiment that make the popular masses the guardians of the culture that the dried-out and sterile bourgeoisie has denied and betrayed'. (45) In this marxist form of popular front thought, commercial music belonged to the dying bourgeois stage of society, while the music of the people heralded the future. 
		 Communists worked to replace bourgeois commercial culture with cultural sources that were popular in this sense, cultural works and practices with working-class authenticity because they existed outside of or in opposition to the market. Delannoy argued that 'handing over to the people the treasure of their personal musical patrimony' would be 'an excellent therapeutic against the microbe of commercial music, the virulence of which modern mechanics strongly increases'. (46) Communists sought to return to workers their cultural tradition, believing that they had been alienated from their own heritage by modern industrial society. Revivifying popular cultural forms would re-forge the link between the two. Communists of the Marseille Maison contrasted popular cultural heritage with the 'false' commercial products of the bourgeois culture industry. Through embracing popular cultural sources, 'the popular masses, instead of surrendering themselves for their intellectual lifeblood to the Tino Rossis, the Zevacos, and the Verneuils, will finally become acquainted with what truly constitutes the artistic patrimony of France'. (47) Tino Rossi, top singing star of the time, Michel Zevaco, author of swashbuckling serial novels, and Louis Verneuil, successful actor and playwright, were commercial successes and, in the eyes of communists, products of the bourgeois culture industry. The commodity/consumer cultural interaction they implied weakened the working-class movement by reproducing the power relations of capitalism in the cultural realm. Cultural life stemming from the workers themselves or their heritage, on the other hand, would strengthen it. 
		 Folklore, in addition to representing popular cultural tradition, also featured in communist cultural projects as a non-commercial popular source. Maison activists argued that 'Folklore emanated from the people', and they vowed to give it 'the possibility to develop freely, sheltered from influences outside of the people'. (48) FMP members hoped to replace current commercial repertoire with works inspired by French folklore, regenerating popular music. They wanted 'the beautiful songs of our provinces' to supplant 'the current despicable production' of the bourgeois music industry. Folksongs were the cultural inheritance of the French people, a common good that stemmed from all and could serve the cause of all, unlike commercial music that served to enrich the few. 
		 The opposition between commercial and popular cultural expression was complicated by genres that potentially fell into both categories. Although members of the Maison de la Culture and the FMP rejected commercial culture as a dangerous influence for the working class, workers themselves increasingly consumed products of the mass culture industry, especially commercial songs. The 1930s witnessed the explosion of recorded music, spread through the new media of radio and cinema. The debate among communist cultural activists over music-hall performers crystallised the dilemma. 
		 Music-hall (staged variety acts for a socially broad audience) constituted a key pillar of commercial music's circulation: performers would debut on the stage, and if successful would progress to the recording studio. Their songs were then broadcast on the radio or used in films, followed by the performers' return to the stage with heightened appeal. (49) Some FMP members, such as composer Charles Koechlin, rejected music-hall as 'light music, little desirable, with flat and primary harmony, with a simple, sensual or sentimental melody. [...] Light music is often vulgar, and to call it popular music is an insult to the people, this people who in the past created the beautiful music of folklore'. (50) Others, however, embraced it as an expression of popular life. Georgius, a comic singer praised by critics as 'the most popular representative of current music-hall', was described by writer Eugene Dabit, linked to communist cultural organisations, as 'the very synthesis of popular gaiety, with his spirit, his cockiness, his composure, his good sense, and his poetry'. (51) The Maison hired many music-hall performers to sing at its events, perhaps because such stars were sure to attract an audience. In practice, drawing a distinction between commercial and popular sources proved more difficult than in theory. 
		 The PCF's continued cultural dedication to the working class during the popular front was also revealed in the close cultural connection it maintained to the international workers' movement, and especially to the Soviet Union, in spite of the Party's new national outlook. The Chorale Populaire de Marseille (Popular Chorus of Marseille), also formed during the popular front, sang not just French folksongs but also folksongs from other nations. A review of a concert featuring popular songs from different countries declared: 
		  The people know how to sing when they are delivered from the low forms of music that are habitually offered to them [...] it is simply about [...] putting them in the presence of the riches of which they are the legatees [...] and aiding them in reconquering not only what is their own national heritage but also the heritage of other peoples. (52)  
		 The cultural inheritance of workers included works from all nations. In particular members of the PCF idolised Soviet culture, during the popular front because they believed that the Soviet Union had achieved the ideal communist society. The Maison and its affiliated organisations relied on Soviet authors and composers as cultural sources commensurate to French ones. Plays by celebrated Soviet playwright Maxim Gorki were especially widespread in France during the popular front, and more than any other could draw workers without fail. One of the leaders of the Bordeaux Maison hoped to perform a translation of Gorki's 1932 play Egor Bulychev: 'The idea, which I imparted to the bureau, seduces us greatly, because the mere name of Gorki is a powerful lever that brings our worker comrades running to us'. (53) The French popular front did not represent a rethinking of the relationship of the PCF with the Soviets or with Soviet marxism. Even during the popular front, when communists prioritised the antifascist coalition of each nation, they maintained their dedication to a class struggle that extended beyond national boundaries. 
		 For communists during the popular front, intervening in cultural life represented another means of fighting the working-class fight. Communist cultural activists aimed to connect workers to the popular cultural sources they believed would sustain their confrontation with capitalism by enriching their sense of attachment to both their French past and their working-class future. 
		 Reconciling the working-class and the national 
		 By merging the national and class definitions of 'popular', communists created a new left-wing identity. These two conceptions of the people--the French nation or the working class--and 'the popular'--relating to a primordial (left-wing) French character or to 'authentic' non-commercial material--were not in fact contradictory for communists who participated in the popular front. Rather, they coexisted through the connecting thread of France's revolutionary tradition. Incarnated in 'truly' French values, such as liberty and equality, and in the fight to forward and protect them, this tradition had been carried through time by the French people. The workers of the 1930s, communists argued, represented the successors of France's historical people, and France's revolutionary tradition constituted the cultural heritage left to the contemporary working class by their predecessors. That patrimony, forged by the sans-culottes of 1789 and their counterparts in subsequent struggles, would in the 1930s be protected from fascism and the contagion of bourgeois commercial culture by the working class. The 'true' cultural inheritance from France's historical people related to the life and struggle of the working class and its forebears. The working class, as the modern iteration of the French people, would develop French culture in the present and the future. 
		 Communists considered the cultural artefacts of the French Revolution as the prime popular patrimony now claimed by the working class. They construed the Revolution as the work of the people of the time, the sansculottes, and the workers as the sans-culottes of the 1930s. The songs of the Revolution had particular resonance in a popular front context. As FMP member Roger Desormiere explained, the French Revolution 'directed musicians towards ideals of liberty, fraternity, equality'. (54) Maison de la Culture events celebrated especially the street songs of the sans-culottes, such as 'La Carmagnole, 'the most popular song of the French Revolution'. According to the FMP: 
		  Of all the popular songs of revolutionary tendency that illustrate numerous glorious or tragic exploits in the fight of the working and peasant masses against tyranny, power, and autocracy, and that the revolutionary tradition has consecrated, 'La Carmagnole' is the only one--except for 'L'Internationale--that has continually remained in favour among the proletarians.  
		 The writer speculated that this was due to the song's ability to incorporate 'revolutionary couplets accommodated to the circumstances of contemporary social events that one wanted to stigmatise through the song', gaining meaning from each revolutionary period in France's history, now including the popular front. (55) Such songs remained politically significant. At a fete celebrating the composer of 'La Marseillaise', when the singers 'arrived at the second couplet of "La Carmagnole", a stray white [royalist] cried: "Enough"'. Conductor Peters-Rosset turned around and 'directed the entire room to take up the refrain'. (56) 
		 The chain of popular transmission applied to any of France's historical people who had displayed devotion to such popular French values as solidarity, industriousness, or justice. Rouen's Chorale Syndicale Populaire (Popular Trade Union Chorus), formed in January 1937 through the initiative of the city's chief trade union and Maison de la Culture to 'organise concerts for working-class audiences'. Made up of union members, it chose repertoire that demonstrated the links connecting the past to the present. The chorus aimed to 'awaken and maintain in the working class the taste of musical culture, by the collective study of the works that are the most characteristic of the popular repertoire (revolutionary songs, work songs, folksongs, etc.)'. (57) This list of categories constituting the popular repertoire recounts working-class heritage moving back in time from the French Revolution, to the time of tradesmen's associations, to the pre-industrial people of folklore. In this vision, cultural forms recreated the link between the workers and their ancestors. Contemporary workers performing songs from their inherited popular repertoire transmitted the identity of the French people through the ages, refreshing among the working class the collective memory of the popular past. 
		 Communists also considered the Middle Ages an era rich in popular inspiration for the present working class. In November 1936, Peuple et Culture (People and Culture), the cultural review of Marseille's Maison, began a column called 'Our cultural heritage'. The editors vowed that 'at this hour when the dominant class lets darken in obscurity our cultural heritage, it is up to us who work for the working class [...] to take up and exalt this heritage'. The inaugural column featured a poem by French medieval poet Rutebeuf who broke with the courtly tradition of the troubadours. Rutebeuf, the article explained, 'a poor man, a singer of the streets, of more than modest origins, [...] was one of the first French poets who, instead of singing about games and laughter, was not afraid to sing about his misery'. (58) The works of Rutebeuf, a member of the historical people who produced art relating to popular life, belonged by birthright to the modern incarnation of the people, the working class. Maison members cast medieval cathedrals as collective popular works, creations of artisans whose names had been lost but whose exalted vision had engendered magnificent monuments. They found the current era ripe for modern versions of such achievements. One FMP member maintained, 'Our era sees instituted the social order that permits the renovation of culture and the birth of great works. These can only be born if the creators feel carried by the thought of the masses for whom and by whom they create and achieve'. (59) In gathering artists and workers in the same organisation, Maison members believed they could facilitate this connection between 'the creators and the masses' that had existed in the past and the popular front had again engendered. 
		 Communist criticisms of the popular front cultural project 
		 Unsurprisingly, communists disagreed about what constituted authentic popular sources, and not all of them adopted the new concept of 'the popular'. Some communists believed that only aesthetically revolutionary art could spark cultural transformation, and thus the avant-garde mattered more than the people for cultural creation. The reviewer in Rouge Midi criticised the first painting exhibition organised by the Marseille Maison's Arts Plastiques (Fine Arts) section for the inclusion of too many still lifes and landscapes 'seen a hundred times'. He regretted that so many of the works diverged from his understanding of the exhibition's goal: 'to present to the public new works, audacious as much in spirit as in form'. (60) 
		 Others believed that culturally revolutionary art was necessarily produced by workers, not artists inspired by the popular spirit. Working-class Marseille painter and Communist Party member Antoine Serra led a group of young, rebellious painters who depicted working-class spaces of factories and docks. The review of an exhibition published in Rouge Midi attributed the group's innovative qualities to these artists' ability to aesthetically valorise their working-class roots: 'The artists who exhibit here have not renounced their origins. On the contrary! Conscious of the value of the aesthetic experience they have acquired in their class condition, they intend to affirm it'. (61) Serra was also a founder of Marseille's Maison de la Culture, and spearheaded its painters' section, which taught workers technique but encouraged individual style. For Serra, working-class painters most closely approached true painting, because they had removed their art-making from the influence of the market, which was driven by the desire of buyers for the picturesque. Unlike the artist 'who wants to live from his art' and therefore 'makes many concessions in the form and substance of his art', working-class painters 'prefer to earn a living by learning some other trade, rather than submit to the demands of the buyers', and therefore were 'the only ones who can bring to art the essential element of its liberation', a liberation from the market. (62) 
		 Some French communists rejected the popular front cultural project altogether. One Marseille communist argued that 'there is no true culture without a revolutionary conscience, there is only erudition or dilettantism'. Cultural engagement meant 'furnishing man the most possibilities to fulfil himself, to understand the present and prepare for the future with the maximum revolutionary understanding and intelligence of his destiny'. In his opinion, 'all these cultural efforts supposedly attempted for the masses are formal without the least revolutionary impact'. (63) He echoed Soviet politician Nikolai Bukharin's socialist realism sentiments, which were influential in France at this time and held that culture should be 'the expression of the nascent socialist man's intimate life'. (64) For this Marseillais, popular front cultural initiatives focused too heavily on formal, or aesthetic, questions, neglecting the ultimate purpose of furthering the socialist revolution. However, his was a minority view during the popular front. 
		 Success among the working class, failure for the coalition 
		 The popular front cultural strategy proved successful for communists, despite its ambiguities, because of communists' ability to reconcile nation and class. The left-wing identity that combined these two cultural traditions appealed to many workers, who participated in communists' cultural programs and joined the party in increasing numbers. In general, workers appear to have welcomed the opportunity to participate in cultural activity and accepted the assistance offered by cultural figures affiliated with communism. 
		 The Maison de la Culture viewed the cultural engagement of workers in the Paris region with satisfaction, for example. To establish a close connection with the working class, members extended their activity to the Parisian banlieue (outer suburbs), home of Paris's industries and the workers employed there. The Parisian cultural activists believed that 'the workers, grouped in the interior of these factories for their work, will naturally group themselves on this same basis for their leisure'. For this reason, they encouraged the formation of cultural groups 'constituted on the basis of workplace, responding thus to the aspirations and needs of our worker and employee comrades'. (65) The lack of cultural expertise and connections of the working-class organisers meant that they required the help of Maison members: 
		  Unfortunately, these popular clubs, directed by devoted comrades [who are] not prepared for the task, do not have sufficient means to interest all their members. [...] It is thus up to our Ile-de-France region [of the Maison de la Culture, designating the banlieue] to bring sufficient elements of culture and entertainment to interest our comrades. (66)  
		 The Maison organised for these working-class organisations lectures, shows, and visits to museums and other cultural establishments. By 1938, the National Centre reported, 'The Ile-de-France region has seen intensify over the course of these last months its collaboration' with these groups. 'From all sides, from the factories of Paris and the banlieue, from the depots of the metro and the auto bus, the taxis, and the [train stations], the popular clubs call upon us to nourish their work of education, culture, and entertainment'. (67) 
		 Workers appreciated the expansion of their cultural horizons. Five members of the Chorale Populaire de Paris attended a Saturday morning concert rehearsal in early 1938 at the Paris Conservatory, reduced price tickets to which the FMP had procured for its working-class members. Three had never before attended a concert. However, in spite of this lack of experience, a Maison member, journalist Juliette Pary, reported: 
		  They were not overwhelmed. During the two hours of music, they did not budge. The metalworker was there, immobile, taking in each sound. It was the 'Bolero' of Ravel [...] that spoke to him the most. The electrician discovered in the 'Waltz' an unsuspected world: 'It is like a musical revolution for me!' he said. [...] The blond dressmaker not only was not bored, but wants at any cost to return to the next concert. The waiter, in leaving the Conservatory, energetically declared: 'Me, what I find marvellous is the "Tremolo" of Ravel!' They were almost indignant when one asked them if they didn't regret having to get up so early on their free day, [...] to have made the effort of listening. 'It was worth it,' they all said. (68)  
		 Jean Roussari, one of the workers who attended the general rehearsal, regretted 'that these morsels do not have words, for they would certainly please the Chorale'. (69) FMP members believed that participating in choruses prepared workers for broader musical experiences, familiarising hitherto elitist music and performance spaces. Habituating workers to music entailed incorporating it into the working-class cultural world, making it accessible and making it theirs. After the workers attended the concert, Pary wrote, 'Ravel belongs to them!'. She told the story of a mechanic learning to like Bach, during which he realised that Bach was simply 'an old comrade', a phrase that communicated fraternity and solidarity with erstwhile 'high culture'. (70) 
		 The success of such endeavours among workers indicates that the inclusive national yet class-based cultural approach resonated more than the previous sectarian approach that cast them as the proletariat. The communist popular front cultural movement highlighted the workers' ambiguous cultural position, privileged in terms of their capacity for communal activism and unprivileged in terms of cultural access. It allowed them to feel a crucial part of the national community while emphasising the cultural needs of their group. 
		 More broadly, however, the communist reconciliation between the nation and the working class failed, because it contributed to the disintegration of the popular front coalition. Communists argued that the workers constituted the mobilised people of the 1930s, which for some republicans smacked of socialist revolution. Though communists stressed the workers' devotion to the nation, for moderate members of the coalition already suspicious of the communists and only reluctant members of the popular front in the first place, their insistence on working-class cultural emancipation proved too much to stomach. By 1938, a large segment of the coalition's moderate republicans had become disillusioned with the popular front. The Communist Party had successfully forged a working-class movement, but their attempt to foster a wide antifascist coalition ended in ruin. 
		 Conclusion 
		 The communists of the popular front engaged in a balancing act, remaining the champion of the proletariat and forwarding the cultural interests of the working class, while at the same time adopting a more inclusive antifascist attitude and turning to broader French cultural sources to support their aims. They maintained the balance by casting the contemporary workers as the cultural inheritors of the previous people of France's history. Communists appropriated French cultural sources that stemmed from 'authentic' popular sources, like folklore, and refashioned them as part of working-class heritage. In this way, communist cultural politics during the popular front constructed the French people as the bridge between France's past tradition and the building of France's new socialist, antifascist society, connecting the two because the people carried France's left-wing values. Communists argued that true French identity was antifascist, egalitarian and progressive, and in the 1930s was enshrined in the working class. By adopting hitherto nationalist images and rhetoric, and infusing them with republican or revolutionary values, communists during the popular front reclaimed a French national identity for the left. The popular front represented an attempt to create a viable left-wing alternative to fascism, which involved the engagement by the Communist Party with French cultural tradition, and innovative attempts to create working-class cultural forms within the context of this tradition. 
		 As an important instance of communists delving into cultural matters in an effort to create authentic working-class cultural life, the popular front represents a precedent for the 'cultural turn' of the post-Stalin decades. Beyond a certain point, of course, the comparison breaks down. The interest in the relationship between the self and the social and the interactions between the personal and the political that characterised the later period were less important to activists during the popular front than questions about the articulation of culture, politics, and society. (71) The popular front emphasis on the national and its relation to the working class would not be repeated later, when activists highlighted identities that the categories of nation and class obscured, such as race and gender. Unlike the post-1956 period, the 1930s renovation took place along national lines, as the Communist Party reintegrated working-class identity with national belonging. 
		 However, like the rethinking of the left after 1956 attributed to the New Left and the 'new social movements', the popular front represented a cultural reinvention of the Communist Party and a reworking of its working-class identity. The attempts to break down the barriers among political activism, ordinary life, and cultural experience, and between the working-class and artistic milieus, connect the two periods as well. The importance of cultural transformation for societal transformation was a lesson that communists learned during the popular front, which would influence their actions in the post-war period. Communist assertions during the popular front that cultural movements, political movements, and social movements were mutually reinforcing and that their interconnectedness was integral to the strength of all three were ground-breaking and set the stage for future developments.

Jackson, pp53. The connection of the parties, in particular the Communist Party, to this heritage was more complicated than this comment suggests.

<titre>Saint-Gobain chief defiant after failed takeover One of France's oldest groups has dismissed criticism from analysts and investors as questions mount on performanceDigital evolution Group steeped in tradition embraces technologyTimelineThree centuries of history for manufacturer founded to protect French interests</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE</auteur>
<texte>
		The chief executive of one of France's oldest industrial companies is in no mood for criticism. 
		 "Honestly, this is bullshit," Pierre-André de Chalendar, the boss of Saint-Gobain, told the Financial Times in response to accusations that the company was too complex. While "it would be foolish for me to say we are perfect", those who criticise are "sometimes people who have uneducated views".
		Mr de Chalendar is understandably defensive. He has just come through a failed takeover attempt of Swiss chemical group Sika that highlighted what critics describe as years of underperformance, poor investment decisions and top-heavy bureaucracy. 
		 The discontent comes as President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to shake up outmoded practices at some of France's largest companies. 
		 Established by French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1665 to counter Venetian glass imports, Saint-Gobain made the mirrors at Versailles. The company still makes glass, but it also makes and distributes building and construction materials, and prides itself on embracing technology. It employs 180,000 people worldwide and in 2017 pulled in €40bn in sales. 
		 The tussle over Sika focused investors' minds on Saint-Gobain's hunger for acquisitions, its balance sheet, profitability and management. Its share price has fallen 20 per cent over the past year. 
		 Mr de Chalendar is now trying to draw a line under his pursuit of Sika, which began in 2014 and ended without Saint-Gobain taking control but booking a large capital gain. 
		 The French company had tried to takeover Sika by buying 52 per cent of the voting rights but only 16 per cent of the shares from the controlling Burkard family. But the deal became bogged down in the courts, with investors such as the Bill &amp;Melinda Gates Foundation complaining it flouted corporate governance norms and disadvantaged minority shareholders. 
		 The legal stand-off was finally resolved last month, with Saint-Gobain taking a nearly 11 per cent share of Sika but accepting six years of standstill agreements before it can increase its stake past 12.9 per cent. 
		 Sika secured its independence and paid Saint-Gobain a premium to retire the outsized voting rights, while allowing the Burkards to exit the company. All parties were left with pride intact. 
		 "I think it's a good deal for everybody," said Mr de Chalendar. "In the end, it's a good compromise," Urs Burkard, who represented the Burkard family, told the FT, adding that Saint-Gobain "played fairly and honestly from day one". 
		 Operating margins at Saint-Gobain's three core businesses of building distribution, innovative materials and construction products are all below their recent peaks, however. And the rating agency S&amp;P said the company's profitability ratios were lower than those of its rated peers because of the low margins of its distribution business. 
		 Felix Brunotte, an analyst at independent research house AlphaValue, argued in March that Saint-Gobain was simultaneously "too centralised and too de-centralised". 
		 "For me, it's like a government with many layers of management," he said. "It's very complicated to do [any] change in the organisation." 
		 Mr Brunotte believes Saint-Gobain relies too much on acquisitions to fuel top-line growth — the company estimates it has made about 1,000 over its long history, including 60 over the past two years. The company has also pursued an aggressive share buyback programme in recent years, a strategy that can suggest organic growth opportunities may be lacking. 
		 Mr Brunotte argued Saint-Gobain's pension fund was underfunded, its asbestos liabilities were potentially open-ended, and its much-vaunted innovations were not delivering. 
		 He also said Saint-Gobain's return on capital employed — a measure of the efficiency of its investment — was below its cost of capital, measured by its weighted average cost of capital, WACC. This suggests that the company was not employing its capital effectively or creating value for shareholders. Christopher Rossbach, an investor in Sika at J. Stern &amp;Co, was also critical. He said companies such as Nestlé, Diageo and LVMH have "strong competitive positions in good and growing businesses, good managements, strong balance sheets and proven track records of generating long-term value. Saint-Gobain has none of that." 
		 Mr de Chalendar refused to accept the criticisms and insisted Saint-Gobain's breadth, built through acquisitions, was one of its great strengths. He dismissed Mr Brunotte's views as "nonsense". 
		 Saint-Gobain's chief financial officer, Guillaume Texier, added that the company's return on capital employed was 11.2 per cent in 2017, below its recent peak of 12.1 per cent in 2008, but beating its WACC of "approximately" 9.7 per cent. 
		 Regarding acquisitions, Mr de Chalendar said valuations were high and he was "going to stay very disciplined". 
		 Overall, criticism comes back to the central question of whether Saint-Gobain needs to modernise more quickly. This is even more important in light of Mr Macron's desire to drag corporate France into the 21st century by forcing companies to adapt and update. 
		 It is not the first time that Saint-Gobain has come under pressure to change. Ten years ago, Wendel, a storied French investment house, tried and failed to shake up Saint-Gobain when it built a 20 per cent stake. 
		 Mr de Chalendar argued that adjustments that might have looked easy to make, from the perspective of someone outside the company, were in reality more challenging to achieve. But some investors suggest Wendel simply underestimated the cultural barriers to change within Saint-Gobain. 
		 One senior banker in Paris, who has followed the company closely, said Saint-Gobain was "conscious of what history means and they ... won't break their business just to create short-term shareholder value". 
		 Mr de Chalendar himself said that, although the company has had to make radical alterations over its long history, his "vision of Saint-Gobain has not changed basically" since he took over. 
		 Saint-Gobain certainly does not feel like a company on the defensive. It moves into new, glossier headquarters in <mention id="1787">La Défense business district</mention> next year. Mr de Chalendar, meanwhile, said he would like his legacy to show he had "transformed the culture of Saint-Gobain from being manufacturingdriven to customer-driven". 
		 He was also not alone in his confidence that the questions being asked about the company's performance will eventually lose resonance. 
		 As another senior banker in Paris, who knows the company well, said: "Saint-Gobain has survived revolutions — it will survive this too." 
		 Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Zurich Saint-Gobain prides itself on its embrace of modern technology despite its 350 years of history. Its factories, churning out products from insulation through to smart-glass, are increasingly automated and boss Pierre-André de Chalendar spoke with great force about the company's digital evolution. 
		 He argued that soon middlemen in the construction industry would be needed less and customers would have increasing control over the products that made up their homes. That was an opportunity that demanded a technological push and a strengthening of Saint-Gobain brands. 
		 But although his company goes to great pains to demonstrate its modern edge, it remains conscious of its long history — something Saint-Gobain's in-house historian is there to help with. 
		 On the north-eastern edge of Paris, Saint-Gobain has turned a 150-yearold warehouse into a showcase of its latest innovations in materials and technology. But even there it has a wall dedicated to its centuries of history with snapshots of landmarks leading the way into the building. 
		 Traces of its history can also still be seen throughout France and its capital. The imposing <meronyme id="1788">Grande Arche</meronyme> at <mention id="1789">La Défense</mention>, the Grand Palais, the Pyramid at the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower in central Paris can all thank Saint-Gobain for their glass façades, floors and ceilings. 
		 However, one of the company's most dramatic claims was preventing the assassination of a French prime minister. Georges Clemenceau's life was saved after a Saint-Gobain windscreen stopped a bullet meant for him in 1919.

<titre>Total vows surgical response to crude's slide as it steps up cost-cutting efforts</titre>
<auteur>CHRISTOPHER ADAMS</auteur>
<texte>
		As a posse of Total managers heads for the lifts, Patrick Pouyanné peels away to his office at the top of <meronyme id="1790">the French oil group's tower</meronyme> at <mention id="1791">La Défense</mention> in Paris. 
		 The newly installed chief executive collapses into a sofa opposite a painting of a refinery fire - the Le Havre plant set ablaze by company employees in 1940 before the German army arrived. The scene is apt, given the turmoil confronting energy companies including Total.
		In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Pouyanné says Total will weather the storm sweeping through the oil and gas industry by accelerating and deepening a group-wide costcutting plan initiated by his late predecessor Christophe de Margerie. 
		 But while the plan will involve steep spending reductions, Mr Pouyanné insists his response to a halving in crude prices since last June will be surgical rather than drastic. He will sell some less profitable exploration and development projects and delay others. There will be a contentious restructuring of Total's troubled refining business in France, but "nobody will be fired". 
		 "We are all rediscovering that oil is a volatile commodity," Mr Pouyanné says, pointing to weaker than expected growth in demand, the boom in US shale output and a Saudi-led decision by Opec in November not to cut production as reasons for the price collapse to less than $50 per barrel. 
		 He sees little sign of a rebound in the first half of 2015. 
		 Mr Pouyanné's aim is therefore to reduce Total's break-even price - the minimum level at which the group can profitably produce oil - by $40 a barrel. 
		 He believes this goal is proportionate. 
		 "We have to react, but not overreact," he says. "A major company like Total has always been successful when we manage to maintain our base strategy for these types of low prices . . . The best way to face this volatility is to have the company strong enough to lower your cash break-even." 
		 Underlying Mr Pouyanné's plan is a "very important" commitment to maintain Total's dividend, something he regards as essential to retain investor confidence in the company. 
		 Total, Mr Pouyanné says, will reduce group capital spending by 10 per cent in 2015, from $26bn last year - a larger cut than expected. Of that reduction, the exploration budget - the easiest area where majors can save money - will be cut 30 per cent to less than $2bn. 
		 Two costly oil sands developments in Canada will be put on "a long backburner", and proposals to dispose of $10bn in assets by 2017 will be accelerated. 
		 There will be bigger savings in operating spending this year - $1.2bn rather than a previously planned $800m. Part of this will involve expenditure on mature brownfield projects such as Alwyn in the North Sea slowing. 
		 Downstream oil refining operations will face capacity reductions, leading to partial site closures of the kind that have proved contentious with French trade unions. While the slide in crude provides some relief, Total's European refining margins are weak, as the sector struggles to compete with more efficient plants in the Middle East, overcapacity in Europe and falling petrol and diesel consumption. 
		 Mr Pouyanné says no refineries will be shut down but three in Europe face high break-even prices. The model of Total's Carling petrochemical plant in Lorraine - where the steam cracker used to produce lighter hydrocarbons is closing at the cost of at least 200 jobs - will be used as a template for those refineries that need to be restructured. 
		 The group will have to tread carefully. 
		 "We have the model of the steam cracker in Carling [to work with]," he says. 
		 While he is unable to guarantee no French jobs will be lost, nobody will be sacked and those affected will be found other roles in Total. 
		 Mr Pouyanné, who ran Total's downstream operations before being appointed chief executive, says that after a three-year restructuring plan ending this year, the division will have saved $300m in operating expenditure. The refining margin was $20 a tonne in 2014, he says, but the group's base assumption is that it will be $25 in the future. 
		 He is anxious to avoid cutting too deeply and threatening future output growth, saying oil prices will eventually rebound. He dismisses the idea that Total, the largest producer in the North Sea, could begin decommissioning fields in the region as the economics deteriorate. It will continue to invest in Angola, where last month he inaugurated the 160,000-barrels-a-day CLOV project, and the company is as committed to Russia as it was before Mr de Margerie's death in a Moscow plane crash in October. 
		 Total is developing the $27bn Yamal liquefied natural gas project in the far north of Russia with partners including Novatek and CNPC, but is coming under pressure because of western sanctions on Moscow related to Ukraine. The sanctions prevent dollar funding, but Mr Pouyanné is confident financing will be in place by mid-2015, drawn from European and Chinese banks. 
		 He will not be deterred by sanctions. "It has been a long effort to go to Russia . . . You will not jeopardise that," he says. "People have memories. You have to be with the partners not only when it's a good time, when the power is high, when things are developing, but also when it's harder." 
		 What kind of industry will emerge from the price collapse? Does he foresee a wave of mergers? "You will see some impact on smaller players. I think it will be an opportunity for larger players maybe to have access to resources at a lower cost." 
		 Total could play a part in that consolidation if, say, the slide in prices leads to a shakeout among the US shale producers. "We are pragmatic. If there are good deals, we will study them. But we need not rush." 
		 Pouyanné put into power 
		Test for the man filling gap left by the Big Moustache 
		More than any other oil major, Total has been associated with the personality of one man - the group's gregarious and well connected former chief executive Christophe de Margerie , also known as the Big Moustache. 
		 For Patrick Pouyanné , 51, who has taken over the role following de Margerie's death last year, the challenge of inspiring employees, as oil prices fall and costs are cut, while nurturing the same kind of working relationships as his predecessor with foreign governments, will be immense. 
		 What, then, will define Mr Pouyanné's leadership style? "You don't need to be clever, let's stick to the basics," he says, citing four management tenets: safety, delivery on projects and financial targets, cutting costs and a laser-like focus on "creating cash". 
		 Mr Pouyanné does not shy away from a hard-won reputation as a ruthless instigator of change - notably through cost-cutting. Yet he does not want simply to be seen as the right person in leaner times. 
		 Mr Pouyanné believes he has the "same capacity to be intuitive as [de Margerie] had", speaking about his predecessor's famed charm, which analysts and investors saw as a vital strength in negotiations over projects in difficult countries. 
		 "I maybe have one advantage," he adds. "Because of the dramatic events of 2014, there is a strong feeling of union in our company. They . . . lost their cheerful CEO and they want to face this economic situation . . . Everyone is motivated to demonstrate that Total is strong. I need to maintain this motivation."

		Anyone looking to expand their property portfolio may well have encountered the term "value gap". It is a current favourite among estate agents to describe the price discrepancy between city and provincial markets. According to research from Savills, it can be substantial: in the UK the London property market is today about 35 per cent above its 2007 peak; in rural areas house prices are still 13 per cent down.
		There is increasing talk about the bargains available by trading in a city bolt-hole for a place in the country. Oliver Knight, of estate agents Knight Frank, estimates that a well turned-out home in the Cotswolds will sell for about £500 per sq ft, while in inner London it is hard to find anything below £1,250 per sq ft. In super prime areas, such as Mayfair, that figure can be above £2,200, according to joint research from Lonres and Dataloft. 
		 Overseas, the uplift can be even more pronounced. Diletta Giorgolo Spinola, head of sales at Sotheby's office in Tuscany, says that the price per sq metre of an apartment in Rome is at least four times higher than that of a villa in the Marche countryside, and often a lot more. According to figures published by the Notaries of France, median prices in Paris can be up to seven times that of rural or provincial areas. 
		 So, given £1m in spending money, is it better to go for a compact city pad or a sprawling country manor? The FT has compiled a list of five locations to show the difference. 
		 But before you decide which, it might be worth considering some words of warning from Roarie Scarisbrick, of the buying agents Property Vision. Earlier this year, he thought about trading in a three-bedroom house in Fulham and moving to the countryside outside London. 
		 "I had dreams of gatehouses and lodges and rolling hills, and had to come back with my tail between my legs," he says. "The reality is a tiny house in London is worth about as much as a tiny house in the home counties." Only once you move beyond a commutable distance from the capital - Scarisbrick estimates about 70 miles away - does the value gap start to open up. 
		 Still, with London fading - the prime market having dropped about 0.9 per cent in the 12 months to the first quarter of 2015, according to Savills - and the rural market holding steady, is now as good a time as any to buy a place in a remote corner of the countryside?

<titre>Bouygues' rejection hits sector's shares Telecoms: French connections</titre>
<auteur>ADAM THOMSON</auteur>
<texte>
		French telecoms stocks plunged as hopes of consolidation evaporated after Bouygues Telecom turned down a €10bn offer from rival Numericable-SFR. 
		 Shares in Bouygues, the conglomerate headed by Martin Bouygues that includes France's third-biggest mobile operator, fell 8 per cent as soon as markets opened. Shares in Numericable-SFR, the mobile operator controlled by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi ,dropped 10.4 per cent.
		Shares in Iliad, the low-cost operator, fell 6 per cent. Shares in Altice, Mr Drahi's Amsterdam-listed holding company, which controls Numericable-SFR, were down 6.4 per cent. 
		 The rejection all but kills the prospect of the number of operators going from four to three competitors, a move that many analysts see as vital to ending a three-year price war. 
		 In a research note, Jerry Dellis of Jefferies said: "The categorical terms in which Bouygues rejected Numericable-SFR's offer last night make it difficult to envisage any improved offer succeeding until next year." 
		 Stephane Beyazian of Raymond James went further. "Hopes of French market consolidation have now completely disappeared in our opinion," he said in a note. 
		 Mr Bouygues' decision will probably be welcomed by France's Socialist government, which had opposed Mr Drahi's plans, arguing they would be bad for investment in the sector, bad for consumers and bad for employment. 
		 "It's rather obvious that this transaction will destroy jobs, which is what some like to call synergies," Emmanuel Macron, economy minister said yesterday. "We are against this choice." 
		 Mr Macron held a meeting with Mr Drahi before Bouygues announced its decision. "We talked about investment in the sector," Mr Drahi said as he left the ministry. 
		 Some were surprised by Mr Bouygues' determination to retain the telecoms company he launched in 1996. Analysts viewed Mr Drahi's offer as generous given the operator's poor financial health as a result of the price war. 
		 One person close to the situation said that Mr Bouygues' resistance had to do with his proximity to the government. "When you say no to €10bn sitting on the table, it means only one thing: that you are establishment," they said. 
		 But Mr Bouygues, 63, who took over the group from his father in 1989, said that there had been no political pressure. 
		 He told RTL radio on Wednesday: "A company is not just any old piece of merchandise. Not everything is for sale." 
		 Mr Bouygues said that he doubted how Mr Drahi, who has funded a €36bn acquisition spree over the past year and a half with debt that he spreads across the acquired units, could pull off a purchase of Bouygues Telecom. 
		 "I don't see how Mr Drahi could set up serious financing and, at the same time, take on all of the remedies" the competition authorities would have demanded, he said. 
		 He was confident his mobile operator would return to financial health by 2017 thanks to deep internal restructuring and to the unit's portfolio of spectrum and its extensive 4G network. 
		 Shortly after announcing the offer, Numericable-SFR said that it had entered into exclusive talks with Iliad, controlled by Xavier Niel , a billionaire, over the sale of assets related to the bid for Bouygues. 
		 Mr Bouygues said that he had been "a little astonished to see that Mr Drahi and Mr Niel were arm in arm". 
		 Altice declined to comment. 
		 Founder's snub 
		Saying 'no' to Drahi was a task to be savoured 
		When a reporter once asked Martin Bouygues whether he would sell Bouygues Telecom, the industrialist fired back: "Would you sell your wife?" 
		 Such is the love that Mr Bouygues, below, a member of one of France's most renowned industrialist families, has for the telecoms unit he founded almost 20 years ago he turned down a €10bn cash offer - up to double what some analysts think it is worth. 
		 "He is like a farmer guarding his farm," said one person who knows him. "He has a rational approach but also a deeply affective one, which explains his decision." 
		 Mr Bouygues, who likes hunting on the weekends, became chief executive of the group his father, Francis, founded 63 years ago in 1988. 
		 A year later, he replaced him as chairman, taking over the reins of a conglomerate that spans construction, property development and media, via the television channel TF1, the country's biggest private broadcaster. 
		 Among the other projects, Bouygues built the European Parliament building in Strasbourg, <meronyme id="1794">the Arche de La Défense</meronyme> in Paris, the headquarters of the UK's Home Office in London, and the Stade de France. 
		 Bouygues Telecom, Mr Bouygues' clearest contribution to the family-controlled business, had revenues last year of more than €33bn and operating profit of €1.1bn. The group has more than 127,000 employees, who hold 23.3 per cent of Bouygues shares. 
		 Mr Bouygues, an affable figure known for self-deprecating charm, last year lost out to Patrick Drahi as the two men slugged it out in a fight for SFR, the mobile unit of Vivendi. Slamming the door shut in Mr Drahi's face probably failed to compensate for that, but few could doubt that Mr Bouygues enjoyed it.

<titre>Big data killed the wealth management star COMMENT</titre>
<auteur>YURI BENDER</auteur>
<texte>
		More than 35 years ago, The Buggles, a British band, recorded "Video killed the radio star". The song heralded the onset of an optimistic era of automation, while lamenting some of its side-effects. 
		 Today, in the new-age technology hubs serving the financial centres of London, Paris and Amsterdam, those concerns are gaining ground.
		In <meronyme id="1796">the twin towers of Société Générale</meronyme>, sprouting out of <mention id="1797">the purpose-built Parisian business district of La Défense</mention>, private-banking boss Jean-Francois Mazaud describes his "test and learn" approach that was kick-started in the bank's "innovation lab" five years ago. 
		 Idealistic graduates from French business schools, who once would have been busy constructing ill-fated derivative-based structured products, are turning their hand to financial technology, apparently "part of the group's DNA". 
		 The old Buggles nightmare of a system that "can't rewind" is played down by Mr Mazaud, in favour of equilibrium between man and machine. A human-based wealth management offer should allow clients to set their own cursor to regulate time spent with their adviser. 
		 The issues jangling the nerves of French financiers are shared by the pragmatic bankers of the bleak Dutch hinterland in Amsterdam-Zuid, home to ABN Amro, the country's leading wealth manager. 
		 All of them have visited Asia and seen how far banks there are ahead of the technology curve. Most foreign competitors are watching DBS , one of Singapore's leading providers, closely. It is introducing a predictive system from IBM, the technology company, allowing staff to monitor vast reams of data and assist asset-allocation decisions for clients. 
		 This has been influenced, in turn, both by tech-savvy Korean banks and Chinese groups such as Alibaba , the ecommerce group, and Tencent , the gaming and messaging company. 
		 The question for private bankers is how far they can afford to go into this battle with data? Publicly most will say they will do whatever it takes, even if they have private reservations. " Big data are not just a big dream," says Jeroen Rijpkema, chief executive of international private banking at ABN Amro. 
		 This obsession with data delivery and robotic channels of communication has its dangers. Indeed, many of the existing private banking problems of poor asset allocation and the sale of incorrect products are not really solved, but exacerbated. 
		 Blind digitisation will not help heal those wounds. "The only way you can improve this is by changing the underlying model and processes," says Tim Tate, global head of client experience at Citi Private Bank's Canary Wharf headquarters in London. 
		 Much of his bank's transformation process is influenced by its Citi Ventures private equity arm in Palo Alto, California, which helps Citi take a five-year view of digitisation and not get bogged down in the daily IT grind of updating websites and tweaking apps. 
		 Digitisation has, so far, improved the "line speed" of existing services, but it has yet to cause any real disruption or innovation, says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, an asset management consultancy. 
		 Unlike retailers and other commerce sectors, wealth and asset managers are still missing a huge digital opportunity. "The mindset of many firms is simply to adapt existing capabilities," says Sebastian Dovey, co-founder of Scorpio Partnership, the wealth management consultancy. 
		 The next stage has to be a complete transformation of the industry, and, believes Mr Dovey, revising the engagement rules between bank, client and wealth. They could even go as far as aiming for the sentiment of another hit song of the Buggles era, Fern Kinney's "Together we are beautiful".

<titre>Ban Non Wat: mainland Southeast Asian chronological anchor and waypoint for future prehistoric research.</titre>
<auteur>THOMAS PRYCE</auteur>
<texte>
		10.15184/aqy.2015.107 
		 The timing and nature of Southeast Asia's Neolithic and Bronze Ages have been the source of global archaeological intrigue, scepticism (on occasion) and even notoriety for some five decades (e.g. Muhly 1981). Being asked to review an account of what has been an emotive topic provoked a personal response, which I hope may contribute to highlighting the impact of Charles Higham's work and that of his many colleagues. 
		 My course in Southeast Asian prehistoric research began when I joined Vincent Pigott and Surapol Natapintu's Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project in late 2004. This juncture corresponded with what might be called the 'second intermediate period' of Higham's radiocarbon technological development--post-organic temper but pre-bone ultrafiltration. As such, arriving for my very first excavation in Southeast Asia in January 2005 (at Ban Non Wat as it happens), I was immediately confronted by a team member with the evidently pointed question: "do you support the long or the short chronology for the Bronze Age". To which the only honest answer was, "I don't know", having not read enough about it at that stage. Clearly, there was contentious ground under foot and given that my PhD was to concentrate on the evolution of prehistoric copper-smelting behaviours at two of the region s main production sites, Non Pa Wai and Nil Kham Haeng, I reasoned I had better tread carefully.
		Although such wariness would generally be well advised for a junior academic, it had not accounted for the huge upheaval in the dating of Southeast Asia's Neolithic and Bronze Age transitions during the period 2005-2014. The substantial majority of this remaking of the regional late prehistoric chronology can be directly attributed to the application of third-generation radiocarbon techniques to human bone and shell grave-goods samples by Higham and colleagues; firstly at Ban Non Wat (Higham &amp; Higham 2009), then Ban Chiang (Higham et al. 2011) and finally Non Nok Tha (Higham et al. 2014). This fervour was also replicated by the Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project, where the enthusiastic prescription of Higham's (1996: 12) chronometric hygiene' medicine in 2007 led to many of the original charcoal radiocarbon dates (Pigott et al. 1997) being rejected and to the central and northeastern Thai chronologies being largely harmonised (Rispoli et al. 2013; Higham &amp; Rispoli 2014). 
		 At this point, my archaeometallurgical research becomes of some relevance to the regional Bronze Age debate. At the central Thai copper-production site of Non Pa Wai, I identified a potentially experimental phase of smelting concurrent with competent bronze founding, which, chronology aside, would be poorly compatible with the SCM's technological transmission mechanism of migrating experienced metalworkers; it would also be arguably closer to the LCM proposition that Southeast Asian metallurgy was stimulated by trade and exchange' with present-day China (Pryce et al. 2010). This impression was reinforced by the subsequent Southeast Asian Lead Isotope Project, which highlighted that the earliest eleventh century BC copper-based artefacts from Non Pa Wai and Ban Non Wat were incompatible with any known regional copper source but that within a very short period of time, perhaps 50 years, locally produced raw copper was being exchanged over at least several hundred kilometres (Pryce et al. 2014). It also transpired that some of Ban Chiang's earliest copper-based artefacts, dated by Higham to the tenth century BC, are highly consistent with the Sepon production site in central Laos, which until now has only produced Iron Age dates (Pryce et al. 2014). No Non Nok Tha samples have yet been assessed for provenance. 
		 Of course, archaeological interpretation, and science in general, is never a done deal and major new discoveries could revise the current picture, but I think we are at the stage where objective resistance to the broad brushstroke of the SCM model is no longer a realistic position. That said, there is both scope and necessity for further investigation into potentially historically significant regional variation when the current dataset is so overwhelmingly Thai. At the very least, any reasonably definitive appraisal of the sequence and nature of copper-base metallurgy's transmission from or via present-day China will require high-quality Bronze Age datasets from the contact zones of west to east, northern Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, where none exist at present. Furthermore, while Ban Non Wat is without doubt a 'great site' and its excavation has revolutionised our understanding of Southeast Asian late prehistory, I do not believe the manner of its investigation can serve as a viable regional model. Quite simply, shifting that much dirt and properly studying everything that comes out of it during long seasons, year after year, is ruinously expensive, and very few other teams, whether local or foreign, could hope to bear the burden. This could be the moment to call for even greater collaboration amongst Southeast Asian archaeologists, so that we band together to dig fewer sites more thoroughly, but there are perhaps too many competing interests now active in the region. 
		 Finally, Charles Fligham has by now struck his SCM point firmly home by a number of means on a number of occasions. Near-consensus having been achieved, at least for the time being, I fully agree with his suggestion that we concentrate our efforts on Southeast Asia's more needy archaeological lacunae. In the meantime, let us encourage the guidebooks on Southeast Asia to correct their historical background sections that are now 30 years out of date, along with the regional sections of some major national museums. Southeast Asian prehistory has so much more to give than a 50-year-old bout of overenthusiasm.

<titre>Paris advertising campaign adopts clichés to lure City workers</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW</auteur>
<texte>
		"Tired of the fog? Try the frogs!" <mention id="1806">Paris's business district</mention> has unveiled an advertising campaign that embraces longstanding national clichés in the hope of luring London-based workers to the French capital. 
		 The advert, which features a large frog wearing a French tricolore tie sitting in front of <mention id="1807">La Défense's skyscrapers</mention>, is the latest in measures aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote and attracting big financial groups to Paris.
		"Brexit is bad news for Europe but it's a fantastic opportunity for Paris and <mention id="1808">its business district</mention>," said Marie-Célie Guillaume, chief executive of Defacto La Défense, the body responsible for managing <mention id="1809">the finance hub in western Paris</mention>. "France is ready to welcome business and finance."  
		 <mention id="1810">La Défense</mention> is <mention id="1811">Europe's largest business district</mention>, home to 400 companies and 160,000 employees, include the likes of HSBC, Société Générale, EY, KPMG and Allianz.  
		 The lobbying effort seeks to highlight <mention id="1812">La Défense</mention>'s 3.5m square metres of office space and strong transport links, as well as the wider cultural attraction of the French capital. 
		 The initial focus is on luring financial companies, which are likely to be among the worst affected by Brexit if they lose their "passporting" rights to operate across the EU. It will also target workers in the energy sector as well as start-up businesses. 
		 Britain's vote to leave the EU sparked a charm offensive from a host of European cities - including Frankfurt and Warsaw as well as Paris - seeking to win business should companies decide to relocate parts of their operations.  
		 French financial regulators last month said they were simplifying the process of registering financial companies "in the context of the Brexit vote" by allowing documents to be filed in English. The government has also announced tax breaks for foreign expats living in France. 
		 "We want to build the financial capital of the future . . . now is the time to come to France," Manuel Valls, French prime minister, said after June's referendum vote. Jean-Louis Missika, a deputy mayor of Paris, added: "We'll be rolling out the red carpet [to bankers]."  
		 France has a historically ambivalent relationship with high finance. But with domestic economic growth stubbornly slow and unemployment above 10 per cent, many in the government see the Brexit vote as an opportunity for Paris. 
		 The fight to attract financial jobs represents the continuation of an enduring battle with London as well as struggle with other eurozone cities, notably Frankfurt, to become the hub for euro trading in the currency bloc. 
		 Many expect that London, the dominant currency trading centre, will lose its right to clear deals denominated in euros following a Brexit. Euronext, the pan-European exchange, is based at <mention id="1813">La Défense</mention>. 
		 Senior bankers say French financial groups have put the brake on sending staff to London since Britain's vote to leave the EU over concerns about the future of the City as a financial centre.

<titre>Falling for Paris again?</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		What a difference a (possible) Brexit makes. Four years ago France's new president, François Hollande, taking aim at the wealthy, had bankers squarely in his sights. "My true adversary is the world of finance," he had said during the campaign, touting a Franco-German pact to attack the "dominance of finance" and tilt Europe back towards traditional industry. In office, he launched a 75 per cent super-tax on earnings above €1m and hiked France's wealth tax, the annual levy on valuable assets.
		The super-tax was quietly shelved at the beginning of last year. By July this year, with the prospect of a UK exit from the EU - which could result in many companies in London's financial sector seeking out a new base - Hollande's administration was in full U-turn mode. 
		 Manuel Valls, the prime minister, unveiled Europe's "most favourable" fiscal regime for foreign executives. It would include an income tax break of up to 50 per cent on executives who relocated and exclude foreign assets from the wealth tax for eight years (the current exclusion period is five years). "Paris as a financial centre is what makes France's attractiveness," said Valls, to cheers from his audience of leading executives. 
		 On the face of it, the French capital is well positioned to benefit from a Brexit. Of Europe's major cities, only London has a larger economy of financial and business services (lawyers, recruitment firms and the like), according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. The $350bn annual output of Paris may be less than London's $490bn but it is far ahead of third-placed Moscow's $166bn. 
		 Europe's second-largest financial and business services sector will not be the only draw for London's wealthy tech and banker types. Hollande's single-minded pursuit of affluent Parisians led to rich locals leaving in droves in the years following his election. Top-end prices fell sharply, leaving averages in this sector less than half that of equivalent homes in London . According to Knight Frank, prime Paris homes sell for between €14,600 and €17,800 per sq metre, compared with a range of €33,000 to €40,300 in London. Over the past three years, prime Paris prices have fallen more than 8 per cent, against a 6.4 per cent gain in London. Over one year, there have been falls of, respectively, 3.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent. 
		 London's bankers may be delighted at 50 per cent discounts on purchase prices compared with the UK capital, but the costs of keeping a French home are far higher. The French price falls derive in large part from the wealth tax, say agents. 
		 Last tweaked in 2013, this covers properties valued at €1.3m and above. At €1.3m, it means a 0.5 per cent annual levy of the property's value above €800,000. The marginal rate then increases, in several steps, to 1.5 per cent - at least €150,000 a year - for homes worth more than €10m. 
		 No wonder some of Paris' finest homes in the fashionable, if dull, 16th and 17th arrondissements are now readily available. "Where large family apartments had been hard to come by, suddenly they were two a penny," says Roddy Aris of Knight Frank. 
		 Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, of agent Daniel Féau, says the stock of top-end homes has risen 40 per cent since Hollande was elected. The agent has a large five-bedroom apartment on sale in the 17th for €2.85m. For those who hanker for some outside space, the same agent is selling a four-bedroom house with a large garden on the edge of La Muette neighbourhood for €4.75m. 
		 What Hollande's tax tilt did for international buyers is a moot point. Few earn an income in Paris, meaning that they avoided the super-tax; many more dodged the wealth tax by funding their purchases with mortgages rather than cash. (The proportion of a home's value borrowed from the bank does not attract the tax.) 
		 Meanwhile, a weakening euro has made the city more appealing to those with dollars to spend. Middle Eastern buyers - long-time fans of the city - returned to the 16th and 17th arrondissements, where they can fit their staff into the large apartments and their motorcades into generous underground car parks, says Lundgreen. 
		 In the city's centre - a smaller pool of generally smaller flats in the narrower historic streets across the 6th and 7th arrondissements - the tax-fuelled exodus took the pressure off overheated prices. In areas such as the Latin Quarter, small pieds-à-terre were commanding up to €20,000 per sq metre, says Aris. "In the last 12 to 18 months prices have come off and local buyers are returning," he says. 
		 Nearby on Rue de Bourgogne, in the 7th, Savills is marketing a two-bedroom apartment for €1.99m. 
		 Buyers from the US - also long-term fans of Paris - are joining them. They have started to return to their favoured Left Bank, south of the Seine as it passes Notre-Dame, says Aris. Despite the prime price falls, the finest flats in the 6th arrondissement still command prices comparable to the grandest in London's Chelsea, says Kate EverettAllen of Knight Frank. "  Mais bien sûr  ," you can hear Hollande retort.

<titre>The French capital needs to acquire a head for heights Paris Notebook</titre>
<auteur>ADAM THOMSON</auteur>
<texte>
		For generations, Paris's wide boulevards and elegant balconied buildings have dazzled tourists and given the French capital one of the most beautiful and recognisable faces of any city in the world. 
		 But when it comes to being competitive in the 21st century, the legacy of Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who oversaw the rebuilding of the city between 1853 and 1870, is one big pain in the backside.
		Whatever you think of London's rapidly changing skyline, it has played a critical role in keeping the city in step with the modern world. The UK's capital has more than 20 projects of 50 storeys or more , either under way or in the pipeline, that will provide homes for billionaires and global corporations alike. 
		 In Paris, things are a little different. Before Christmas, Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest listed commercial property company, applied for a permit to start construction of a 180-metre tall glass triangle of offices, hotel and convention centres designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron. 
		 If it goes ahead, as expected, the project, designed so as to cast almost no shadow on other buildings in the 15th arrondissement, will be the city's first skyscraper in more than 40 years. 
		 It is easy to understand the lack of modernisation: Paris's architecture is more uniform than that of London and the city is considerably smaller, offering fewer opportunities for developers. But even by the most conservative standards, Paris has proved remarkably resistant to change. 
		 Just ask Bernard Arnault: the billionaire behind luxury conglomerate LVMH spent more than a decade fighting in court for his planned redevelopment of the La Samaritaine department store. 
		 Its proposed Rue de Rivoli façade, a shimmering glass curtain, did not go down well with either residents or preservation groups. Mr Arnault eventually got his way but only by appealing in the Conseil d'État, the country's ultimate authority for administrative matters. 
		 Meanwhile, the last skyscraper Paris inaugurated was the 1973 Tour Montparnasse, the unloved 210m block that dominates the city's southern skyline. Bad experiences like that have made it even harder to push for new projects. 
		 Over a recent lunch in Unibail-Rodamco's "model room", a space in its Paris headquarters filled with exquisite skyscraper designs converted into 3D form from the sketchpads of the world's best-known architects, I got a sense of just how hard it is. 
		 "You see that?" Christophe Cuvillier, the company's chief executive, asked me, pointing to an intriguing model of a Renzo Piano design for an island in the Seine. "It'll never be built. Planning permission is impossible." He points to another model near by. "Nor that one," he says. "Nor that," waving a finger at yet another. 
		 "Paris is very protective, which is great for charm and cultural history but it has the immediate consequence of leaving no new space." 
		 The strict codes - bar some exceptions, buildings cannot exceed 31 metres - have left the city woefully short of good offices. So much so that Mr Cuvillier says that, if a company of 700 employees or more wanted to settle in Paris in new or refurbished premises, it would be able to choose from just one of two sites. 
		 Why should any of this matter when the city has <mention id="1816">La Défense</mention>? <mention id="1817">The area</mention>, beyond the capital's western border, has for years acted as Paris's safety valve for office space and it is now <mention id="1818">Europe's largest business district</mention>. 
		 One reason, argues Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor who is in charge of urban planning, is that a city cannot stay relevant if all it does is preserve the old. 
		 Paris, he insists, "has to renew itself century after century". As part of that effort, the mayor's office this month unveiled the winning projects of its "Reinvent Paris" competition to develop 23 sites. 
		 Unibail-Rodamco's Mr Cuvillier agrees. "Paris needs to be a great place to work and do business, not just a great tourist destination," he says. "A capital city that is attractive is a country that is attractive."

<titre>Euronext on the alert for merger fallout Interview: Stéphane Boujnah</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		Stéphane Boujnah , the chief executive of pan-European exchange Euronext, refuses to be left out of the consolidation that is shaking up his industry. 
		 In the middle of a proposed $30bn mega-merger between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse to create an European exchange group to rival those in the US and Asia, he has his own card to play.
		With Euronext's strong cash generation and low debt, "we will be able to move very quickly for very significant targets if opportunities come up", he says in his office in <mention id="1819">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1820">the Paris business district</mention>. 
		 "There are independent exchanges in the eurozone that may want to reconsider their future," says the 52-year-old former Santander banker who took the helm at Euronext in November. "They may want to be part of a pan-European exchange group where they can still keep their identity but grow at the same time." 
		 Euronext, which was spun out of Intercontinental Exchange of the US in an initial public offering in 2014, runs bourses in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The remaining independents in the region include Madrid, Luxembourg and Vienna. 
		 Others potential targets include any exchanges that have to be sold to win regulatory approval for the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal, which is expected to close at the start of next year. 
		 "Some assets might be sold [as part of the deal], and some of those assets might be interesting to look at," he says. 
		 Analysts point to the LSE's 57 per cent stake in LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for derivative and bond trades, and Deutsche Börse's ownership of Clear-stream, one of the region's biggest settlement houses. 
		 Large deals are not the core of Euro-next's three-year strategy, however. Its official plan, outlined in May, is to grow "quasi-organically", investing €100m to €150m by 2019 to diversify away from its core equity strength. The group wants to grow in areas such as data analytics, exchange traded funds, open-source indices and commodities. 
		 Euronext plans to increase revenue about 5 per cent a year and increase group operating margins from 57 per cent - one of the highest in Europe - to between 61 and 63 per cent by 2019. 
		 Mr Boujnah says the group cannot just be "more efficient", however. "When you are small, you can be agile, and you must be agile . . . The conditions are there for us to be able to use our balance sheet to react very quickly." 
		 An interest in larger deals comes in part because Euronext, with a market value of about €2.4bn, is four times smaller than LSE and Deutsche Börse. The expected merger would make Euronext a minnow in Europe. 
		 Mr Boujnah stresses that the LSE-Deutsche Börse combination is far from done. "All I can say is that the last 20 years show that these transformational deals always take a lot longer than expected and never turn out as initially anticipated." 
		 He highlights some of the potential hurdles. "The Deutsche Börse shareholders, the LSE shareholders, the European Commission, the prudential supervisors and various other regulators in Germany all need to sign off on this. Anything can happen." 
		 Careful not to criticise the deal itself, he says there could be competition issues creating a trading group some 10 times the size of Euronext, its next largest competitor in Europe. 
		 The planned combination of LCH and Eurex Clearing "is essentially combining two banks", Mr Boujnah says, and so could raise "too big to fail issues". 
		 There is also the risk that the value of the two companies will change, particularly after this week's referendum on whether or not the UK will remain in the EU, he says. 
		 "It is always difficult to deliver any paper deal a year from closing, let alone with Brexit in the middle." 
		 His carefully chosen words belie the intense lobbying that is going on in France against the British-German deal. 
		 Last month Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said he wanted to "express the concern of the French government on this tie-up . . . We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe". 
		 If a deal goes ahead, says Mr Boujnah, it will not change his core strategy. "They [LSE and Deutsche Börse] will focus on being a global player in indices, derivatives and post-trade," he says. 
		 Euronext's focus in on profitability, strengthening the core business, and to "focus on financing the real economy in Europe", he says.

<titre>Europe plots a bank heist FT BIG READ: BREXIT AND THE CITY</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		On a rainy June morning in Paris, five dozen men and women gathered in a basement in <mention id="1821">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1822">the city's financial district</mention>. Over bitter coffee and fluffy croissants, the great and the good of French politics, business and finance had gathered to plot a heist.
		With two weeks to go before the Brexit vote, they wanted to be ready with a sales pitch to lure the international financial groups based in London, should Britain vote to leave the EU. Now, they reasoned, any company with pan-European aspirations would be compelled to move jobs , business lines, even headquarters out of London . 
		 At the time hardly anyone seemed to believe that the UK electorate would really vote to leave. But that didn't stop the Parisien elite. Jean-Louis Missika, a deputy mayor of Paris, promised he would be "rolling out the red carpet" to bankers if Brexit happened. Gérard Mestrallet, head of the Paris Europlace lobby group, says this was "the moment" for Paris as a financial centre. 
		 It is a dramatic turning of the tables. Four years ago, Boris Johnson, the then London mayor turned Brexit frontman, who said on Thursday he would not enter the race to be next Conservative prime minister, was goading Paris for the "tyranny and terror" of its rich-soaking tax policies and inviting French bankers to escape to London.  "Vous êtes tous bienvenus,"  he boomed. 
		 This time it is Paris that is appealing to bankers in London with a "Welcome to Europe" slogan. 
		 The French charm offensive has been notably aggressive, but they are not alone. Frankfurt and Dublin - and a long list of others from Luxembourg to Warsaw - are now clamouring to appeal to the banks, insurance companies and asset managers for whom using the City of London as a single European hub may no longer be sensible. And where those financial services groups go, a whole host of ancillary roles - in law, accountancy, consultancy and the rest - will follow. Tens of thousands of jobs, out of nearly half a million in the City, could be at risk, financiers estimate. 
		 The sales pitch is simple. If the UK is outside the EU, financial services companies will be stripped of the " passporting " rules that allow them to operate across borders without local licences. Those companies will need instead to think about a new EU base. The City, which has grown and globalised since the Big Bang deregulation reforms 30 years ago, would shrink and deglobalise. 
		 Not everyone buys the argument. Some contend the City has an even brighter future as a centre focused less on Europe - excelling, for example, in offshore renminbi trading and financial technology. In any case, bullish British lawyers reckon that UK negotiators will be able to strike a deal to extend passporting. If that proves politically impossible, they point to new rules, under the so-called Mifid II rule book that comes into force in 2018. These should give any non-EU country with "equivalent" financial rules access to the single market on level terms. 
		 One snag is the risk of an EU country - like France - sensing a competitive opportunity and seeking to have the rules tweaked to disadvantage the UK. 
		 Even if a good deal is reached, says Simon Gleeson, a lawyer at Clifford Chance who advises many of the big banks, it may be academic. "Banks [will] have to write their contingency plans before they know the [political] situation that will exist in the future." 
		 In other words, a bank may need to decide to shift chunks of its business to more secure EU locations, regardless of what politicians manage to negotiate. 
		 French pitch  
		For banks and investors, there is likely to be an added impetus to move at least some functions to an EU location if, as expected, the European Central Bank insists that future euro-denominated financial trades are cleared and settled within the EU. 
		 The question, then, is which city will win out? 
		 Paris can claim the prize for boldness. Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace, says he has already been in talks with half a dozen global banks. "They are shocked about the result, but looking to move people to Paris," he says. 
		 Promoters of Paris point to several strengths. It has an established financial ecosystem, with five of Europe's 20 largest banks by assets based there. It has a large funds industry managing €3.6tn, second only to London. It is also one of the world's great cities, with its wealth of opera houses, theatres and restaurants. Frankfurt cannot compare, they say. 
		 Paris is a corporate capital as well as a financial one, says Mr Mestrallet. "In Paris you find clients, whereas in Frankfurt you find rival banks," he says, arguing that Paris should be able to attract jobs in asset management, corporate bonds, foreign exchange and clearing . London currently dominates eurodenominated trading and clearing. 
		 Detractors highlight an uncertain political and fiscal environment, not least the possibility of a French referendum on EU membership. President François Hollande declared finance his "enemy" in 2012 as he proposed hitting the rich with a 75 per cent tax rate. Foreign banks point to high social charges. A €300,000 salary paid in the UK costs a bank €352,740 a year after all charges, while in France this same salary cost €471,799. Rules introduced in 2008 mean charges do not apply to foreigners for up to five years, but for long-term local staff it is expensive. 
		 Philippe Villin, an outspoken French investment banker and close adviser of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, says Paris will never become a major financial centre as long as corporate and personal taxes are so high. "At this stage, Paris is almost as appealing as Caracas or Havana for big banks and well-paid and wealthy professionals," he says. 
		 Lobbying groups say the reforms are coming. Ahead of the UK referendum the French government loosened rules for international bond issues. Reformers are also pushing to extend the advantageous tax status for foreigners and add more international schools. 
		 Rival claims  
		Frankfurt has played its pitch cooler, but in many ways is a more natural contender to suck business from the City of London. "I think it is certainly possible that we could see around 10,000 jobs move from London to Frankfurt over the next five years," says Hubertus Väth, from Frankfurt Main Finance, a group that promotes the city as a financial centre. "German, Swiss and US banks are most likely to move." He says it is "relatively clear" that trading activities will shift to Frankfurt. 
		 Frankfurt's biggest trump card is the presence of the ECB, which not only sets eurozone monetary policy but now also supervises the bloc's biggest banks. "You can argue whether it is good to be the capital of regulation, but the ECB has definitely helped boost the city," says one top German banker. 
		 At the fulcrum of the London-Frankfurt see-saw is the increasingly fragile-looking merger deal between Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. The headquarters of the group were supposed to be in London - a decision the companies said would transcend the risk of Brexit and strengthen Germany's access to London's more vibrant capital market. But German regulators and politicians have made it clear that a London HQ would no longer be politically acceptable. One London-based banker close to the deal said such a stance betrayed the small-minded attitudes in Frankfurt that would stop it becoming a major financial centre. 
		 A broader issue militating against Frankfurt is the relative inflexibility of German labour law, such as how expensive it is to fire staff - a particular concern for US banks. Local groups have suggested to the German labour ministry that it consider setting up a zone in Frankfurt where British rather than German labour law is applied as a way of attracting bankers. 
		 Dublin, the other EU financial centre with broad appeal, is portraying itself as a more natural fit with City types. 
		 "Dublin and Ireland are the closest you're going to get to London and the UK," says Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the inward investment agency, pointing to the English language, common laws and a skilled workforce. Industry leaders say the fact that Dublin already has an established finance industry - it has grown from nothing to employ 30,000 people in 25 years - is one of its key advantages. 
		 Dublin's biggest selling point may be that it is about 40 per cent cheaper than London for financial services groups, says Kieran Donoghue, head of international financial services at the IDA. Still, he says the scarcity of high-quality homes is "a pinch point". 
		 Alongside the likes of Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin is a long list of upstart challengers. These include locations that might not be obvious bases for glamorous "front-office" roles, but have nonetheless already drawn large numbers of backroom jobs from the City. 
		 Poland has quietly but rapidly become a big "nearshoring" location. More than 50,000 people are now employed by global banks there. "Nearshoring to Poland is only going to grow even further after Brexit," says Wojciech Poplawski, who heads Accenture's service centre operations in Warsaw. "There's EU access and competitive costs. It's a no-brainer." 
		 At the same time, locations outside Europe may also become more appealing. For banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase or HSBC, lawyers believe Brexit may be the trigger to shift some business to Asia or the US. 
		 'No perfect clusters'  
		For most banks, insurers and asset managers, the response to the rival pitches is unlikely to be straightforward. "It isn't obvious that you try to replicate London where you have everything in one city," says one senior UK-based banker. "Everywhere has deficiencies, nowhere is a perfect cluster like London," says another, describing French labour law as a "disaster". 
		 Instead, groups are expected to disburse employees around the region, depending on office capacity, existing licences and staff preferences. JPMorgan, for example, has licences in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin and may upgrade other locations such as Paris to fully fledged operations. 
		 "If we move roles to Europe, we have the option of distributing them across several locations," says one bank insider. "Not all our competitors do." 
		 Richard Gnodde, co-head of Goldman Sachs' international operations, headquartered in London, told a business summit in London this week: "If passporting was totally removed, we would have to adjust our footprint and where people were located." Goldman has a banking licence for its Frankfurt operation, which includes a small number of staff in securities sales and trading, making the city the most likely destination for any activities moved out of the UK. Goldman is also weighing other options such as Dublin and Amsterdam. 
		 The British banks facing the greatest disruption from any loss of passporting rights are Barclays and HSBC, which have the largest investment banking operations in the City dealing with clients from the continent. Barclays says it has an investment banking licence in Dublin. HSBC executives point to its sizeable trading floors in both Paris and Düsseldorf. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive, said before the vote that it may move as many as 1,000 jobs to Paris if the Leave campaign won. Among non-banks, fund manager M&amp;G has already decided to launch a new range of funds based in Ireland rather than the UK. 
		 Unless there is rapid political manoeuvring to reverse the process of Brexit, there is one certainty - parts of the City of London's fabric will soon start to unravel. But amid all the panic and jostling for business, there are those who sit back and say shrinkage may be no bad thing. 
		 A senior banker, who has large operations in London and Paris, takes a big-picture view. "The overconcentration of financial services in London and in the UK has done big societal damage, as the financial crisis demonstrated," he says. "It may be no bad thing for everyone if there is some redistribution across a number of other financial centres. If 50,000 out of 500,000 jobs move from the City to Paris or Frankfurt, so what?"

		In the Middle Ages, the residents of the inhospitable, low-lying bog, where present-day Amsterdam stands, were forced to co-operate to survive. Overcoming differences in lifestyle and religion in favour of common interest, they teamed up and built dykes to keep the sea out of the "polder", as the land behind was called.
		This early social co-operation resulted in the Dutch word  poldermodel  , meaning consensus decision-making, and is often credited as the basis for the city's famous liberalism and tolerance. "The Netherlands owes its existence to a democracy of dry feet," is how Dutch writer Herman Pleij put it. Amsterdam's progressive spirit has certainly helped to give this small city cosmopolitan appeal, which continues to draw international investors today. 
		 Which is handy because, since the vote for Brexit, several EU cities have been lining up to challenge London as the capital of European finance. According to the New York Times - which rated factors including infrastructure, office space, cultural offerings and the prevalence of the English language - Amsterdam is in pole position. 
		 Some tech companies have already set up bases in the city - WeTransfer, Booking.com and TomTom - but time will tell if the country's cap of 20 per cent of salary on bankers' bonuses introduced last year will deter some financial institutions from relocating. 
		 If top earners do relocate, they will find a property market in bullish mood. In the past 18 months, house prices have surged thanks to the economic recovery of the Netherlands, and a shortage of housing stock, as well as low interest rates of about 2 per cent. Prices dropped 15 per cent after the 2008 financial crisis, but have now overtaken pre-crisis levels and are setting new records in the best areas, according to several agents. 
		 House prices in Amsterdam rose 17 per cent in 2015, according to figures released by the Dutch Association of Estate Agents and Valuers. It has been a rapid rise, says Leslie de Ruiter of Christie's International Real Estate, which recently sold a 1,450 sq metre apartment for €16m. "In the best parts of Amsterdam we are exploring new highs in terms of property prices," he says, with a quarter of sales now above €1m. 
		 The best parts of the city are now 5 or 6 per cent above 2008 prices, according to Barbara Van der Grijp of Engel &amp; Volkers. The agency recently set a new record price in the city of €22,000 per sq metre after selling a house for €8m. 
		 Bidding above the asking price is becoming the norm, she says. "There can be 50 people at every viewing and 10 bids." A former museum, converted into an 18-bedroom mixed-use property, that the agency sold 18 months ago for €7.5m is back on the market for €15m. 
		 In some cases international investors, primarily from the US and UK, are buying a second home to use as a European pied-à-terre. "People come on holiday, see the old city and fall in love. Amsterdam makes every top 10 list for happiness and quality of life," she says. 
		 Engel &amp; Volkers is selling an 18thcentury canal house with a patio garden for €10m. The six-bedroom property features original stucco, marble and woodcarving, and has a basement pool. 
		 There are signs however that the market may be overheating, with insufficient new supply to meet demand. The number of sales in the first quarter of 2016 fell 2 per cent year on year. 
		 However, the city is still cheap compared with Düsseldorf, Paris and London, says Gaby Balkema of Dutch agency Thuis in Vastgoed. Homes rarely sell for more than €15,000 per sq metre and the country has no capital gains tax. 
		 Foreigners tend to buy homes on the banks of the Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Herengracht canals or in the Old South, near the Vondelpark, says Balkema, who likens the area to Chelsea in London or New York's Upper East Side. Christie's International Real Estate is marketing a six-bedroom villa next to the Vondelpark for €11.75m. 
		 New areas such as Zuidas, a financial district comparable with London's Canary Wharf or <mention id="1823">La Défense</mention> in Paris, are also becoming more popular. 
		 Hugo Lindsay, a lawyer for a technology company who moved to Amsterdam from London last year, bought a four-bedroom apartment in a historic building next to the Rijksmuseum "for the same price as a two-bedroom flat in Tooting, [south London]". Lindsay, 45, says the quality of life is "extraordinary" compared with London. "You work fewer hours and you have everything you need: culture, food, and open spaces, in a small city, which is much faster to get in and out of." 
		 Amsterdam still has a way to go if it is to supplant London, though. It has a population of less than 1m, fewer theatres less sporting opportunities and most shops are closed by 6pm. 
		 Buyers in the city centre, especially those on canals, should also be wary of subsidence. For centuries, as in Venice, houses in Amsterdam have been built on up to 20-metre-long timber piles (now often replaced with concrete), which are forced through the layers of mud and clay to reach solid ground. Foundation beams are then laid on top. 
		 Whether the growing demand for property in the city is founded on more solid ground remains to be seen. 
		 i / BUYING GUIDE 
		 Buyers need their own agent to help alert them to homes they wouldn't otherwise find. Yet if you do discover a property independently, they may still charge a fee 
		 Allow 6 per cent of the purchase price for fees and charges 
		 Apartment buildings are managed by an owners' association, which can be poorly run, or in debt, so check its status

<titre>London rivals struggle to prepare for Brexit fallout</titre>
<auteur>JUDITH EVANS</auteur>
<texte>
		Welcome to FrankfurtRheinMain," declares a website set up by the German region, which went live after the UK voted to leave the EU. It offers a 24-hour UK-based hotline for companies thinking of opening an office in the area.
		Frankfurt is one of several major European cities to have launched a charm offensive since the June referendum, aiming to lure businesses - especially financial services - that are reassessing their UK presence after the Brexit vote. Paris's financial regulator is offering fast-track registration; Dublin has caught the eye of one of the continent's largest stock exchanges, Bats Europe, as a possible location for a second headquarters. 
		 Red carpets are being rolled out all over Europe. But cities seeking to attract large departments of blue-chip businesses must also provide something more practical: office space. 
		 Matthew Fitzgerald, head of European tenant representation at Savills, says that immediately after the Brexit vote in June, phones began ringing at his company with a series of requests for data - office rents in Dublin, living costs in Frankfurt, property taxes in Paris. 
		 "A lot of heads of real estate at banks received directives from the top: 'If we had to do an emergency move, what is it going to cost us?'" he says. 
		 In some respects, the answers were reassuring. Occupying an office in another European city is generally far cheaper than in London: top-grade office space in the UK capital costs $243 per square foot per year, including rent, service charges and taxes, while a square foot in Paris is $90 a year and, in Dublin, $76, Savills says. Frankfurt and Amsterdam come in even cheaper, at $55 and $53 respectively. 
		 But this does not tell the whole story. No other European city can rival London's prime office stock, built up thanks to its position as the continent's main financial centre. Vacancy rates across the continent's major cities, meanwhile, are at their lowest rates for a decade, while developers - still bruised from the debt-fuelled building boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis - have been slower to construct new office buildings, leading to a shortage of space. 
		 When it comes to potential relocations, the UK's financial sector is a particular focus, because both overseas and UK companies make use of "passporting" rights under the EU's single market to sell products into other EU countries. If passporting ends, investment banks such as Morgan Stanley say they will move parts of their London operations on to the continent. Other groups have said they may shift operations pre-emptively as Brexit negotiations will take at least two years. 
		 Should a bank seek office space immediately for 2,000 people in <mention id="1824">the central business district of a European city</mention>, <mention id="1825">they</mention> would currently find eight options in Paris, all in <mention id="1826">La Défense in the west central area of the city</mention>, according to Savills research. 
		 In Frankfurt, five such spaces are currently available, while another one to three are expected to come on the market in the next two years. 
		 Madrid, Dublin and Amsterdam each offer a single option, and in Amsterdam that building is still under development. "I am sure the number would be reduced further if we were to define specific requirements with a bank," says Mr Fitzgerald. Any of these options would require a 10-year lease agreement, he added, making them unsuitable for short-term arrangements. 
		 More spaces are available if a company is only looking to relocate 1,000 staff: in Paris, for example, some 16 deals for offices of this size have been done in the past two years. The French capital has the largest overall office stock of any European capital outside London, and a vacancy rate of 7 per cent compared with London rates varying between 3.2 and 5.2 per cent across the West End, City and Canary Wharf. 
		 If companies take action to move to another European jurisdiction, that could spur new office development, but only if they are prepared to sign pre-let agreements on new space, agents say. 
		 Dublin, with its proximity to London, low corporation tax, links with the US and English-speaking population, has been a particular focus of interest, says Mr Fitzgerald. Nick Coveney, director of business space at Colliers in Dublin, says he is working with a London-based boutique financial consultancy looking to set up a base in the city ahead of Brexit negotiations to secure their EU foothold. "They want the absolute premier office space in Dublin," he says. 
		 Companies are assessing other factors beyond property: rates of corporate and other tax, salaries, regulation, the ease of recruiting workers and the potential or otherwise to persuade senior staff to relocate to a given city. 
		 Housing for staff is another concern: "In Dublin we have a shortage of very high-end housing within a relatively easy commute of the city," says Marie Hunt, executive director for Ireland at the property advisers CBRE. "A lot of work is going into improving that, but there isn't sufficient housing today." 
		 High housing costs will result in pressures on salaries and allowances paid out by companies. In Dublin, Amsterdam and Brussels, 90 per cent of the total cost of relocating new workers to the cities can be taken up by subsidising their initial housing arrangements, according to Savills. 
		 Despite the initial flurry of inquiries, most companies are waiting to find out at least the parameters of Brexit negotiations before proceeding, agents say. "Most people are doing their homework now and will make decisions over the next two years," says Ms Hunt. 
		 For those that do move staff, no consensus destination has emerged so far, says Mr Fitzgerald. "Given that there is still no obvious successor to London, it's likely that it could take several years to see a financial of cluster of a similar scale. It would be fair assumption for banks to spread their workforce given business requirements."

		Global real estate has enjoyed two plentiful years - attracting $700bn in direct investment in 2015 and slightly more the year before, not far from the record $758bn achieved in 2007, according to the Chicago-based estate agency JLL. 
		 But 2016 began with equity and bond markets in turmoil, while prices for buildings in key office centres such as London and New York have been coming off record highs. That left the industry with one question to answer: has the market peaked?
		"The bloom has come off the rose a bit in terms of real estate valuations," says Jon Zehner, global head of client capital group at LaSalle Investment Management, one of the world's largest real estate fund managers. "The prime market in gateway cities needed to stabilise - it was getting too hot. This could be an appropriate correction. A period of more stable values and maybe a little less passion in the market is what we're envisioning for the year." 
		 Elisabeth Troni, global real estate strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management, says the company's indicators show "late cycle risks" and it predicts that values will fall in 2016, with the UK market "flat to declining". But she adds: "We're not foreseeing a crash." 
		 A crucial question is the direction of investor appetite. A wave of institutional capital has surged into real estate over the past two years, driven by the search for returns. 
		 That capital has increasingly crossed borders and continents: 20 per cent of real estate deals in 2015 were cross-border, according to Savills. It has also helped to push values up for income-generating "alternative" real estate, such as student accommodation. 
		 Yet according to research late last year by Hodes Weill, the real estate advisers, and Cornell University, institutions remain "significantly underinvested" in property, by an average 110 basis points compared to their own targets. 
		 Property investments are still able to offer more income than other asset classes, which is one of their key selling points. Even US offices, one of the most highly priced sectors in the world, offer a 370 basis point premium over yields from 10-year government bonds, according to figures from Green Street Advisors. 
		 Axa Investment Managers has just raised €500m for a new core real estate fund and has ambitions to expand the vehicle to €5bn. Its launch was driven by growing allocations from pension funds, especially in the Nordics and Benelux region, says Isabelle Scemama, global head of real asset finance. 
		 On the other hand, says Mr Zehner at LaSalle, drops in bond and equity values mean some institutions in the UK, US and Australia are reducing their property holdings this year to stay within fixed allocation boundaries. 
		 As the oil price remains low and China's markets weak, an important question is whether the Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and Asian corporates that have been snapping up big-ticket assets will remain active. 
		 So far, the signals are mixed. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's second-largest sovereign wealth fund, acquired the planned <meronyme id="1827">Tour Alto</meronyme> office development in <mention id="1828">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> in February, a sign of continued activity in the market. 
		 However, Walter Boettcher, director of research and forecasting at Colliers, the estate agency, says: "There are clear signs that continued low oil prices will impact oil sovereign strategies, especially when combined with other market events." 
		 Malaysian funds have been selling overseas real estate assets over the past year to repatriate capital as their home country suffers from the oil slump. 
		 Within east Asia, market turmoil does not so far appear to have hurt demand for real estate: investment volumes into Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese property were up 47 per cent, 66 per cent and 18 per cent respectively in 2015 from a year earlier, according to JLL. Chinese investment into Europe meanwhile appears to be on the increase, says Mr Boettcher - though Asian investors are switching their focus to continental Europe from the highly-priced UK. 
		 "A lot of the money coming out of China to invest in real estate is not institutional. It's corporates or ultra-high-net-worth [individuals]," says Mr Zehner. "The volatility and depreciation in the renminbi have actually seemed to encourage them to invest outside of China - they are looking for stability, diversification and more stable currencies, at least for now." 
		 Agents expect significant new flows from Japan. There Japan Post Bank - which has a $500bn investment fund - has said it aims to divert more cash into global risk assets including real estate. At least two other major Japanese institutions are also looking to expand their overseas property holdings, said Richard DiVall, head of cross-border capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Colliers. 
		 Investors' first concern remains the level of demand for buildings on the ground. In developed markets, banks' unwillingness to lend for speculative development has led to much tighter supply than in the last cycle, say analysts, as well as less financial risk. 
		 They point to a bright spot in Australia , where real estate on the country's east coast has suffered less than expected from the commodities slump. "The office markets and labour markets have surprised repeatedly in recent months. The markets had been preparing for a downturn but they have been positively surprised on net income growth," says Ms Troni of Aberdeen Asset Management. 
		 Private equity investors are meanwhile turning their attention to Italy, where the government is moving to improve private investors' opportunities to profitably access non-performing real estate loans , while economic recovery there has also drawn the attention of sovereign wealth funds, which have been buying up Milan property. 
		 For "higher-octane returns", La Salle is looking to the US and Asia, seeing opportunities for bargains driven by distressed sellers bitten by Chinese economic and market turbulence. 
		 On a broader scale, demographics are driving up interest in residential property. This segment's share of overall investment in the property market has almost doubled to 18 per cent since the downturn, according to Savills. 
		 Homes for millennials in developed economies and the middle class in emerging countries are seen as profitable plays on long-term trends, as are the warehouse sites that cater for their online shopping. 
		 In the shorter term, Mr Boettcher argues "it is too soon to declare an end to the bull market" in commercial property. From New York to Shanghai, investors will be hoping he is right.

<titre>France sets up team in push to lure businesses from London Brexit</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		France will this week step up efforts to attract business from London in the wake of the Brexit vote by appointing a team of corporate leaders and politicians to drive the campaign. 
		 Ross McInnes, an Oxford-educated Franco-Australian and chairman of Safran, the French engine-maker, is to be named the "ambassador" who will head efforts to lure UK-based companies to Paris, say people familiar with the decision.
		Valérie Pécresse, centre-right president of the greater Paris region, and Anne Hildago, Paris's socialist mayor, will also be heavily involved in a sign that the initiative has cross-party support. 
		 An important focus will be attracting financial companies that are likely to be among the worst affected by the decision to leave the EU if they lose their "passporting" rights to operate across the bloc. Some banks, such as HSBC, have already signalled that they could move jobs to Paris. 
		 But the team will also target companies in the industrial, mining, energy and broader service sectors as they look at any businesses that chose to be based in the UK because of its EU membership, people close to the discussions say. 
		 Setting up the team is the latest step in a multipronged approach adopted by France as several European states compete to attract any businesses that decide to move part or all of their operations from the UK. 
		 Immediately after the June 23 referendum, President François Hollande's Socialist government changed the tax rules for expatriates in Paris to make it more generous. 
		 "We want to build the financial capital of the future . . . now is the time to come to France," Manuel Valls, French prime minister, said in July. 
		 In September, French financial regulators said they were simplifying the process of registering new financial companies in Paris, in part by allowing documents to be filed in English. They said this came "in the context of the Brexit vote". 
		 <mention id="1829">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> this month unveiled an advertising campaign aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, with the slogan: " Tired of the fog? Try the frogs! ". 
		 There have also been discussions between French business groups and the government about introducing a special labour code for financial workers, in effect making it easier to hire and fire them than other workers in France. 
		 The inflexibility of the French labour code, along with high taxes, is one of the main reasons some financial groups say they will be reluctant to move to Paris . The idea of a special rule for finance workers has been ruled out, mainly on constitutional grounds. "We cannot have a specific status for jobs in the financial sector," Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said last week. 
		 Senior UK-based bankers are doubtful French politicians will propose any big sweeteners to attract business from the UK before next year's presidential election. One banker who had been lobbied by the French said he viewed any French promises with scepticism because its parliament recently voted to strengthen its financial transaction tax.

<titre>French minister tries to seduce our City boys</titre>
<auteur>JOY LO</auteur>
<texte>
		YESTERDAY the Evening Standard revealed how Frankfurt is on a mission to persuade the world's bankers away from London to leafy "Mainhattan" in the event of Brexit. Now France is also trying to seduce our financiers, with the country's finance minister Emmanuel Macron saying he'd love to have them over in Paris. France will "roll out the red carpet" for those who would want or need to relocate if Britain quits the European Union, he said. 
		 Macron was speaking to Politico's Pierre Briançon on the train from Paris to Brussels, another fave destination for French high-earners in self-imposed exile from their socialist capital.
		His comment came after Douglas Flint, HSBC's chairman, said the bank wouldn't be relocating its headquarters from London to Hong Kong. 
		 While Macron's comments were meant humorously, it's an old wound: Prime Minister David Cameron joked back in 2012 that Britain would roll out the tapis rouge for French financiers hit by President Hollande's plan to raise the French income tax upper bracket to 75 per cent. Not something Dave or Boris are likely to suggest. Ever. 
		 Paris has plenty to offer bankers. <mention id="1830">La Défense</mention> is home to outposts of most of the big global banks; Fauchon and the 16th arrondissement are attractive equivalents to Ocado and Kensington, and the city offers great work-life balance. Anne Hidalgo, now Mayor of Paris, once claimed London was a "suburb" of her city. 
		 That said, there is currently more traffic in the other direction. The half-a -million French people in London — we've done a great job of bringing their world-class bankers over to London — easily outnumber the 400,000 Brits in the whole of France.

<titre>Brexit bargains</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		The wailing and the weeping is impressive for such a sanguine nation but, before the UK howls itself into a Brexit-based residential property catastrophe, we have polished the collective crystal ball to look at a few themes in this sea of uncertainty around the high-end market in London and south-east England.
		Right now is a great time to buy for many international buyers. The fall in sterling means that dollar buyers earlier this week effectively enjoyed an 11 per cent discount compared with the day of the referendum vote. It is also a great time for some domestic buyers thanks to almost non-existent interest rates. 
		 That said, both Savills and Knight Frank have been warning for several months that London's prime market, historically more volatile than the rest of the country, would bear the brunt of the early Brexit fallout. This is the sector with the highest concentration of non-UK owners. In April the rating agency Moody's estimated that foreign nationals accounted for 49 per cent of sales of homes worth £1m and above. With Britain experiencing its biggest political experiment in a generation, it is likely that, villains or saviours, this group will play a pivotal role. 
		 Are they likely to exit because of Brexit? Few of London's super-rich consider the UK's membership of Europe's single market as a factor in choosing a London home, according to Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree Estates, who estimates that non-EU international buyers make up 70 to 80 per cent of this market. "These buyers do not care where Europe is at and they don't believe for a second that Brexit means that London's status as a property safe haven is at risk." 
		 Indeed, following the financial crisis when the UK and Europe were wobbling, these buyers didn't seem to care. Super-prime Mayfair is a favourite destination for many of them - at £2,300 per sq ft, according to Savills, average prices here are 18 per cent above the average in the rest of prime central London. From Mayfair's pricing low point in March 2009 to the end of 2012, a period spanning the end of the UK recession and the darkest days of the eurozone crisis, foreign buyers' appetite helped Mayfair prices gain 61 per cent, far outstripping the 28 per cent prime central London average, according to Savills. 
		 The priorities for this group of buyers were - and remain - personal safety, the rule of law, a favourable tax regime, good private schools and the great British tradition of political and economic stability, says Mark Parkinson of buying agent Middleton Advisors. While the Brexit turmoil appears, by British standards, to jeopardise the last of these factors, it is worth considering what these buyers are often used to elsewhere: capital controls in China and, increasingly, Russia; the president's impeachment and the worst recession for decades in Brazil; a sinking oil price driving the first ever government bond issue in Saudi Arabia. 
		 Besides, for this group the fall in sterling goes much of the way towards offsetting the stamp duty rise introduced in December 2014 (now at 15 per cent on any amount above the first £1.5m for a second home), says Naomi Heaton, chief executive of London Central Portfolio Limited, which manages close to £1bn in prime London property. 
		 Brexit could, however, spell trouble for European bankers who have made their home in London. If the UK does leave the single market, many may find themselves posted abroad. Jefferies, the US investment bank, estimated before the referendum that an exit could see 100,000 banking jobs relocated to Europe. All but 500 of Goldman Sachs' 6,500-strong European workforce are based in London. 
		 They may not be in a rush to sell their homes if they can avoid it. This is hardly a time for dollar or euro investors to realise gains on London property. Earlier this week, a weaker pound meant that the average Kensington &amp; Chelsea home (valued at £1.315m) was worth roughly £110,000 less than on the day of the referendum vote for those banking in euros. Dollar owners, meanwhile, were £144,000 poorer. 
		 Even if continental Europeans start deserting the capital, the impact could be muted: only a third of prime London buyers from abroad are from the EU, says Savills. Collectively, non-European international buyers are responsible for a fifth of all second-hand prime sales. 
		 For international buyers with the stomach for the volatility that may be in store, buying, rather than selling, looks appealing. The downward lurch in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote was the steep dismount at the end of a steady slide. Over the past six months, the combined effect of changes in average property values and shifts in exchange rates, has seen London's 5 per cent most expensive properties get 13 per cent cheaper for euro buyers, and 10 per cent cheaper for those with dollars, according to Hometrack. Over the same period sterling owners in this property elite have seen gains of 1 per cent. 
		 The impact on London's high-end, new-build market is hard to call but the supply-and-demand equation looks obvious: large numbers of units are coming on stream at the same time as prime central London prices are falling. 
		 About 19,000 new homes were under construction in inner London in May - 43 per cent more than 18 months earlier, according to research for the FT by Property Vision, a buying agency, and Dataloft, a research company. A total of 6,249 of them were located in SW8, says Anthony Codling of Jefferies, which includes the prime developments peppering Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Power Station. Codling adds that two-thirds of homes on sale in SW8 today are new - the second highest rate of any London postcode. 
		 Flighty buyers from abroad could threaten prices. Local agents say the new developments - where buyers typically put down between 10 per cent and 20 per cent at exchange and the rest when the homes are completed - have proved very popular with individual investors from Malaysia and China. 
		 With London's prime market cooling - average prices in prime central London have dropped 8 per cent since their peak in October 2014, according to Savills - many are now selling on the secondary market in order to avoid losses, says Johnny Male, of local agent Daniel Cobb. 
		 Developers dismiss the claims. The average gain for resales in the development of Battersea Power Station - where 1,500 flats have been sold since January 2013 - is 30 per cent, according to the developer, Battersea Power Station Development Company. But it would not reveal resale price changes since October 2014 when London's prime market started falling. 
		 Heaton believes that average prices across the area's prime new-builds will fall 20 per over the next two to three years. 
		 Either way, deals are being struck according to some agents. "[Since the referendum] overseas investors have been coming forward with discounts on their offers," says Nanette Hung of CBRE, the agent selling One Nine Elms, which will include London's tallest residential building, and Nine Elms Point. "We have been doing a lot of haggling." 
		 If haggling is not your thing then the sub-£1m market in central London is worth examining. This represents half the housing stock, so there is plenty to choose from, particularly in Bayswater, Pimlico, Paddington and Victoria. 
		 In the immediate future, the big question is, as Judith Evans - the FT's property correspondent - puts it, "whether the new speculative investors will outweigh the people exiting, or those put off relocating to London, because of Brexit". 
		 Longer term, a positive outlook seems likely because London will probably hang on to its "world city" status. High employment levels may take a drubbing but some of its other world city qualities look like they will remain intact: a forgiving political and physical climate, English as the main language, good IT sector, handy timezone, flourishing arts, lush parkland and excellent global connections. 
		 One final thought. If prices in London and the south-east do fall more into line with properties in the rest of the country, even if only slightly, there is some cause for celebration. In some areas of the UK prices have never recovered to their pre-financial crisis levels. And while prices in the Midlands and the north have sunk 12.5 per cent since their 2007 peak, prime London has soared 35.2 per cent over the same period, according to Savills. 
		 As the referendum has vividly demonstrated, extreme inequality fractures society which is no good for anyone or anything, let alone the economy.

		 FT writers on what could happen next 
		Judith Evans 
		 Property correspondent 
		 From a state of near-overheating, Brexit has cast a sudden chill over the property market in London and the south-east. Early indications are that people are thinking more carefully before committing to large mortgages or moving to bigger homes. Some analysts predict prices will fall, others that they will flatten, but it seems clear the days of double-digit annual price rises have come to an end. 
		 Izabella Kaminska 
		 FT Alphaville reporter 
		 On one hand, London property just got a lot cheaper for foreign buyers at the same time that the capital's offshore financial centre status vis-à-vis the rest of the world may have got a boost. On the other hand, it may see demand cut in half as workers flock back to the continent. While news from estate agents is mixed, concerns are growing for the buy-to-let and rental market. The view here is that an independent UK is unlikely to turn away high-skilled workers or the rich. More realistically the low-skilled sector will be affected, most of whom rent rather than buy. 
		 Jonathan Guthrie 
		 City editor 
		 There should be a tumbleweed or two bowling around Canary Wharf, as investment banks relocate staff to the continent. High-end property in the Docklands, or with good transport links to it, should get a lot cheaper. Upmarket apartments across London should become more affordable. Whether they are decent investments depends on whether you believe the capital will continue to thrive if and when the UK quits the EU. 
		 Jamil Anderlini 
		 Asia editor 
		 In recent years, mainland Chinese citizens have overtaken Russian citizens as the single biggest group of foreign buyers of London real estate. With the pound hitting historic lows, the rush by Chinese and other Asian investors is likely to accelerate. 
		 Merryn Somerset Webb 
		 Editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek 
		 Property in central London was overvalued before the referendum vote. And it is still overvalued now. The good news? It is getting less overvalued. 
		 Adam Thomson 
		 Paris correspondent 
		 Central London property prices have long been out of reach for ordinary mortals and Brexit won't change that. Paris may be pricey but London is ludicrous. Brexit is a potentially huge opportunity for the French capital to attract international banks and other financial institutions but there is a dearth of high-quality, centrally located office space. If the big banks do decide to move to Paris, they may have to get used to the idea of being in <mention id="1831">La Défense</mention> or other areas outside the capital's city limits. 
		 Sebastian Payne 
		 Digital comment editor 
		 We will only find out the full economic impact of Brexit in a few months' time, but construction is already slowing and the housing market looks unstable. Although a fall in house prices would help those in my generation who have struggled to get on the ladder, the particular issue in London - high demand, low supply - remains unresolved. It is up to Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor, and the government to get building.

<titre>Human Rights Council Adopts Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of Jamaica and Libya.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Sep 28, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Starts General Debate on the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism The Human Rights Council this afternoon adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Jamaica and Libya, before starting a general debate on the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. Wayne McCook, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that Jamaica had accepted recommendations to establish a national human rights institution and to conduct human rights training and sensitization, and continued to take steps to end prejudice and stigmatization affecting all Jamaicans, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. The Government had already accepted recommendations regarding the Independent Commission of Investigation, which investigated alleged excessive use of force, and therefore regarded as redundant the recommendation to amend the Coroner's Act to strengthen the Commission's powers. In the discussion, speakers welcomed Jamaica's achievements in the field of human rights despite financial restraints, as well as its commitment to reform the justice sector and to establish a national human rights institution. Speakers welcomed the strengthening of Jamaica's legal framework relating to the rights of the child and persons with disabilities, and encouraged continued efforts to combat poverty and strengthen access to education, employment and health services. Speakers were concerned about impunity for excessive use of force by police forces, about violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and about the absence of a formal moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Speaking were Sierra Leone, Venezuela, Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, China, Cuba, Philippines and Rwanda. Also speaking were the non-governmental organizations International Lesbian and Gay Association (joint statement), Amnesty International and Rencontre Africaine pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme.
		Salwa Eldaghili, Charge d'Affaires at the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said Libya was undergoing a very difficult transitional phase and faced formidable political, economic and security challenges. She highlighted the crucial need for support from the international community for putting an end to human rights violations and abuses, ensuring accountability, and ending impunity, and to address security challenges, including increasing terrorism by Daesh, smuggling, and trafficking in persons linked with illegal migration. In the discussion, speakers said the human rights situation in Libya remained of serious concern, in particular reports of arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearances, trafficking in persons in the context of migration, gender violence, and impunity for those violations. Speakers, however, noted the challenges that Libya encountered to ensure peace and security and called on the international community to support its efforts to restore human rights, security and the rule of law. Speaking were Estonia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, State of Palestine, Sudan, Togo, United Kingdom, Venezuela, Algeria and Angola. Also speaking were United Nations Watch, Article 19, Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, Arab Commission for Human Rights, Amnesty International, World Organization Against Torture, Rencontre Africaine pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme, and Centre Independent de Recherches et d'Initiatives pour le Dialogue. The Council then held a general debate on the Universal Periodic Review, during which speakers reiterated their support for this mechanism and highlighted its contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights. Speakers stressed the importance of objectivity, non-selectivity and non-politicization, and called for restraint in the number of recommendations made so as to make implementation more effective. They encouraged the submission of mid-term reports focusing on the implementation of accepted recommendations. Speakers then highlighted the crucial role of civil society organizations and condemned acts of reprisals or intimidation against human rights defenders engaging in the Universal Periodic Review process. Speaking in the general debate were Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union, Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Arab Group, Brazil on behalf of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, Algeria on behalf of the African Group, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Venezuela, Namibia, China, the Maldives, Albania, India, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ghana, Luxembourg, Iran, Grenada and Solomon Islands. Also speaking were UPR-Info, Cameroon Youths and Students Forum for Peace, Human Rights Law Centre, International Educational Development, Canners International Permanent Committee, United Schools International, Centre for Environmental and Management Studies and International Association for Democracy in Africa. The Human Rights Council will resume its work on Monday, 28 September at 9 a.m. to conclude its general debate on the Universal Periodic Review mechanism and start a general debate on the human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories. Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of Jamaica Presentation WAYNE McCOOK, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the United Nations Office at Geneva, stated that Jamaica had accepted 92 recommendations in whole and two recommendations in part, whereas the Government considered 68 recommendations as having already been implemented or as being in the process of implementation.
		The Government had a longstanding policy that reflected its serious commitment to its obligations to implement international treaties. As such the Government did not bind itself and its citizens to any treaty unless it was certain that the domestic framework would stand up to national scrutiny. That fundamental approach had informed the Government's response to recommendations relating to accession to various treaties. Jamaica accepted the recommendations to establish a national human rights institution, to conduct human rights trainings and sensitization of the police force and the judiciary, and to provide human rights education for all citizens through various mechanisms, including school curricula. It also accepted to create an online system to track international recommendations. Jamaica was not opposed to accommodating visits of Special Rapporteurs. However, they were and would continue to be considered on a case-by-case basis. In the case of agreed visits, it was crucial to give adequate notice to the Government through established diplomatic channels. Jamaica had accepted the majority of recommendations on combatting discrimination on any grounds and in all spheres of life and to further the protection of the rights of vulnerable persons, including women, children, persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. A gender equality framework was currently in place for the Government's policies, programmes and plans. Jamaica continued to take steps to end prejudice and stigmatization affecting all Jamaicans, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. It did not accept any recommendations which sought to characterize the attitudes of Jamaican society generally as "homophobic". The Government was grappling with the phenomenon of "street children" and trafficking in persons. As for the decriminalization of abortion, in Jamaica abortion was permissible on certain medical grounds.
		As it had already accepted several of the recommendations regarding the Independent Commission of Investigation, which investigated alleged excessive use of force, the Government regarded as redundant the recommend ation to amend the Coroner's Act to strengthen the Commission's powers. As for the recommendation to end corporal punishment, the Government had abolished its use in early childhood institutions, children's homes and other arranged alternate living spaces, such as foster care. Discussion Sierra Leone applauded steps taken by Jamaica to further guarantee fundamental freedoms and the reform of the justice system despite the challenges in the financial situation. Sierra Leone recognized that the implementation of recommendations was often undermined by the scarcity of resources and urged Jamaica to continue to seek assistance to more comprehensively address adaptation measures to address the effects of climate change. Venezuela underscored significant progress in the area of gender equality and the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities in Jamaica and encouraged it to continue to strengthen its social policies for the benefit of the most vulnerable groups of the population. Bahamas noted with satisfaction that Jamaica had embarked on the path of national transformation through its national development plan 2009-2030, and the continuous efforts to promote and protect the rights of the most vulnerable groups in the society, such as women, children and persons with disabilities. Benin congratulated Jamaica for ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the measures to reduce unemployment, lower inflation and increase foreign investment. Benin urged Jamaica to continue to eradicate poverty, expand access to safe drinking water, and increase access to education in rural areas. Botswana applauded Jamaica for taking measures to protect the most vulnerable, including through the adoption of the social protection strategy. Botswana welcomed the adoption of the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the amendment of the Trafficking in Persons Act, and said that their implementation would be crucial in the protection of the rights of children. China commended Jamaica's comprehensive and positive feedback to the Universal Periodic Review and its acceptance of most of the recommendations. China appreciated Jamaica's acceptance of its recommendations to eradicate poverty, promote economic, social and cultural rights and improve education, especially access to education for poor children and other vulnerable groups. Cuba underscored Jamaica's important advancement of human rights, in particular the implementation of policies to improve the rights of children and persons with disabilities, as well as to improve the health-care system. Cuba appreciated that its recommendations on persons with disabilities and the fight against HIV had been accepted by Jamaica. Philippines expressed appreciation for Jamaica's acceptance of Philippine's recommendation to continue its advocacy for keeping global warming levels above the pre-industrial age. It also voiced appreciation of its increased efforts to establish a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles. Rwanda recognized Jamaica's measures to combat trafficking in persons and the adoption of the National Plan of Action to combat trafficking in persons. It also commended legislative measures aimed at combatting discrimination of women. International Lesbian and Gay Association, in a joint statement, commended Jamaica's efforts to implement recommendations to improve the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, it urged the Government to conduct a legal audit on people living with HIV and to provide them with better access to social services. Amnesty International welcomed the acceptance by Jamaica to establish a national human rights institution, and noted concerns over lack of cooperation from the police with investigations into the killings of civilians by security forces in 2010. It noted with concern that Jamaica lacked a legal framework to prevent discrimination and violence on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. Rencontre Africaine pour la defense des droits de l'homme welcomed Jamaica's cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms and its enrolment in initiatives targeting persons of African descent. It remained concerned about violence and discrimination against women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. The President said that out of 168 recommendations received, Jamaica accepted 92, while 74 were noted. Additional clarifications had been given on two recommendations regarding which parts of these had been accepted and noted. Concluding Remarks WAYNE McCOOK, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the Universal Periodic Review was a vital mechanism that contributed to the promotion and protection of human rights. He insisted that there was no impunity for excessive use of force by law enforcement officials. The Council then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Jamaica. Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of Libya Presentation SALWA ELDAGHILI, Charge d'Affaires at the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said that Libya highly appreciated the pivotal role of the Universal Periodic Review in the improvement of the human rights situation in countries and was keen to positively engage with this mechanism. States had made 202 recommendations to Libya, most of which had been accepted. Libya was undergoing a very difficult transitional phase and it faced formidable political, economic and security challenges. Ms. Eldaghili highlighted the crucial need for the support of the international community and the pivotal role of the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights, putting an end to human rights violations and abuses, ensuring accountability, and ending impunity. Dealing with a variety of security challenges, including increasing terrorism by Daesh, smuggling, and trafficking in persons linked with illegal migration, exceeded the capacity of any state and Libya called for regional and international cooperation in this regard. Libya reaffirmed its commitment to implementing all accepted recommendations, and called for a partnership with international organizations and civil society to promote the rule of law in the country. Discussion Estonia appreciated Libya's participation in the Universal Periodic Review, but expressed concern about the continuing violence between several armed groups in Libya, resulting in hundreds of deaths and mass displacement. The protracted conflict, lack of border controls and fragile rule of law had allowed a continued trafficking of humans, drugs and weapons across Libya's borders. Ethiopia commended Libya's continued engagement with the Council's human rights mechanisms. It noted the challenges that Libya had encountered to ensure peace and security and the impediments confronted in efforts to implement the accepted recommendations. It recommended that Libya redouble its efforts to restore peace and security. Iraq appreciated that Libya had accepted most of the recommendations made to it during the Universal Periodic Review. It commended Libya for the adoption of policies to guarantee human rights and called on the international community to help Libya meet its human rights obligations in light of the challenging situation in the country. Ireland noted that the recent progress in United Nations-led peace talks was encouraging. However, the human rights situation in Libya remained of serious concern, in particular reports of torture and ill treatment in detention centres, which had to be investigated and addressed. Italy welcomed the acceptance of the recommendations by Libya, including the one by Italy to investigate all allegation s of torture and enforced disappearances and bring those responsible to justice. Italy supported the desire of the Libyan people to take forward the democratic transition and restart the reconstruction of the country. Kuwait commended the achievements in the field of human rights despite the current crisis, and said that the acceptance of the recommendations was evidence of the genuine desire of Libya to protect its people. Latvia was alarmed about recent reports of serious human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances, and shared concern about near absolute impunity for those violations. Libya should investigate all allegations of torture, ensure redress to victims, and allow Special Procedures to visit the country. Morocco commended the positive engagement of Libya with the Universal Periodic Review and the acceptance of the huge number of recommendations it had received. Morocco appreciated the commitment of Libya to honour its human rights obligations despite the challenges of transition in political and security fields. Libya was in a dire need of assistance to address those challenges and to build a state of law. Sierra Leone noted with concern the challenges which Libya continued to face, in particular the humanitarian situation which had led to the displacement of thousands and the alarming expansion of terrorist groups in the region. Sierra Leone recognized the urgent need to rebuild State institutions which had been ravaged by the political upheaval of recent years. Rwanda appreciated the continued engagement of Libya with the Council's mechanisms. It encouraged Libya to ensure adequate human rights protection for the migrant populations residing or transiting through its territory, as well as to establish policies aimed at increasing women's participation in decision-making. Palestine valued the efforts made by Libya in the promotion of human rights through the development of a national human rights mechanism, despite the challenges it was experiencing. Sudan extended thanks to Libya for the information it supplied and valued its efforts in the implementation of human rights for all citizens. It expressed hope that human rights education would be included in school curricula. Togo commended Libya for its full commitment to the Universal Periodic Review process. Despite the challenging situation on the ground, Libya had made progress and had accepted most of the recommendations made. It invited the international community to assist Libya in implementing those recommendations. United Kingdom welcomed Libya's constructive engagement with the Universal Periodic Review and acknowledged the challenges and limitations it faced in implementing recommendations. It noted with concern that Libya had limited capacity in investigating human rights violations and bringing perpetrators to justice. Venezuela recalled that up to 2011, Libya had had the highest per capita gross domestic product and life expectancy in the region, and denounced the grave consequences of the military intervention. Venezuela urged all parties to take steps towards peace and said that international law offered solutions to the escalation of violence. Algeria congratulated Libya for the achievements made in the field of human rights and despite the distress the acceptance of many recommendations, including the ones made by Algeria to reach a sustainable solution to the crisis and include human rights education in the curriculum. Angola acknowledged the difficulties facing Libya and expressed appreciation for the assistance to vulnerable groups, and the establishment of the National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights. United Nations Watch called attention to sexual violence which was taking place with complete impunity and said that no actions had been taken to address it. Women's rights were denied to Libyan women on a daily basis and the religious legal opinions issued by the Grand Mufti had been a major blow to the full enjoyment of women's rights. Article 19 - International Centre Against Censorship, welcomed the acceptance of all 14 recommendations related to freedom of expression, association or assembly, in particular to bring to justice perpetrators of assassination of journalists and human rights defenders. Libya must ensure independent, speedy and effective investigations in response to threats and attacks, and establish protocols to collect and safeguard evidence and protect witnesses and lawyers. Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, in a joint statement with World Organisation Against Torture, called on the Libyan authorities to adopt a four-year national action plan to ensure the implementation of its Universal Periodic Review recommendations, and to ensure consultation and cooperation with all stakeholders, including civil society. Arab Commission for Human Rights praised Libya for presenting its Universal Periodic Review report and urged the State to fully implement the recommendations. It was concerned about the reservation placed by the Government on signing the Rome Agreement of the International Criminal Court and expressed concern over the situation on the ground in Libya. It urged all parties to reach a political solution to the conflict. Amnesty International acknowledged the huge challenges faced by the Libyan Government in upholding human rights. However, it remained deeply alarmed at the scale and gravity of abuses perpetrated in the context of armed conflicts and the fight against terrorism, and the lack of accountability for those and past abuses. World Organisation against Torture, in a joint statement, warned about the violence, harassment and the breakdown of the State in Libya; violations committed against human rights defenders was a daily occurrence. In that context the respect for human rights defenders was vital and should be a baseline consensus for any successful agreement between parties to the conflict. Rencontre Africaine pour la defense des droits de l'homme said that Libya was a country where State-wide chaos reigned. Great importance was attached to the recent signing of a draft peace agreement in Skhirat. The situation of African migrant workers continued to be alarming. Those responsible for violations of humanitarian law should be held accountable. CIRID (Centre Independent de Recherches et d'Iniatives pour le Dialogue) stated that Libya's report was biased and full of falsifications. There was no mention of the war crimes committed in Benghazi, and the situation there was dire, with a shortage of medicine, medical equipment, food and water. All efforts should be made to ensure that there was no impunity. The President said Libya had accepted 161 out of 202 recommendations, and taken note of 31. Concluding Remarks SALWA ELDAGHILI, Charge d'Affaires at the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations Office at Geneva, expressed gratitude for the statements made today, most of which expressed full understanding for the current situation and the challenges Libya was facing. UNSMIL's contribution should enable the Libyan authorities to ensure the rule of law and protection of human rights. Thanks to the Universal Periodic Review, the Government would be more able to ensure that human rights were actively protected and promoted in practice. The Council then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Libya. General Debate on the Universal Periodic Review Luxembourg, speaking on behalf of the European Union, reiterated its full support for the Universal Periodic Review process and its contribution to the protection and promotion of human rights. It allowed various stakeholders to take part in the discussions, whereas mid-term reports allowed for a more transparent and regular dialogue. The European Union welcomed the active participation of civil society organizations and national human righ ts institutions. It remained concerned over the harassment, intimidation and repression against human rights defenders. Saudi Arabia, speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, welcomed the Universal Periodic Review process as a mechanism that was based on the values of accountability, transparency and credibility. It was an opportunity for States to review human rights situations, to promote the enjoyment of rights, and to overcome the imperfections in their national human rights contexts. The Universal Periodic Review should be carried out objectively and constructively, without any politicization. Brazil, speaking on behalf of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, appreciated the decision of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize in Brasilia in July 2015 a seminar on the Universal Periodic Review process, and on how to translate human rights commitments into national realities. To that end international cooperation played a key role. The exchanges during the seminar had reinforced the understanding that countries' experiences in the field of human rights were interconnected and mutually reinforcing. Algeria, speaking on behalf of the African Group, underlined the positive contribution of the Universal Periodic Review to human rights, and highlighted the importance of impartiality and non-selectivity. States under review should engage constructively and transparently in the process. The effectiveness and credibility of the mechanism relied on States making a limited number of clear and focused recommendations. Technical assistance and capacity building were also key to the effectiveness of the mechanism, and should be provided with the agreement of the concerned State. Morocco said the Universal Periodic Review should be a space for debate, and a tool for continued enhancement for human rights architecture. Morocco supported the practice of States submitting mid-term reports. The universality of the Universal Periodic Review was essential to its success. It was important to avoid politicization, and to limit the number of recommendations made by States to ensure better implementation. Sierra Leone said it had been actively engaged in the review of all countries, and had carefully made recommendations to address thematic causes of the challenges faced by States. Sierra Leone was also intending to continue the follow-up of its recommendations. The Universal Periodic Review provided a unique opportunity to improve human rights situations, and States should give due attention to this mechanism. Venezuela recognized the important role that the Universal Periodic Review was playing, as it provided for an excellent exchange of equals in the Council. The United Nations system had been a scene of politicized debates, not in line with the Charter. Venezuela rejected impositions of mechanisms and procedures by some powers within the United Nations. The Universal Periodic Review, on the other hand, had shown the way ahead and steered clear of manipulations. Namibia welcomed the fact that the Universal Periodic Review process had thus far ensured a 100 per cent participation rate and all States were commended for their constructive engagement. Its non-politicized nature was evidently appealing to many States. Namibia welcomed and encouraged the participation of and input provided by civil society organizations in the process of promoting and protecting the human rights of its people. China said that the Universal Periodic Review mechanism provided an optimal platform for sharing information on human rights in a universal and equal manner. China was pleased to note that countries were ever more active in participating in and contributing to that process. The mechanism's role should be fully recognized and its non-politicization maintained. There was no "one-fit-for-all" approach for all countries; States should respect the context and the priorities of countries under review. Maldives stated that the Universal Periodic Review enabled dialogue between States and constructive feedback for the enhancement of human rights. It recognized the work carried out by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to create awareness about the role that civil society could play in the Universal Periodic Review process. Maldives warned that the recommendations for developing countries with limited resources were often more challenging. Albania stated that the Universal Periodic Review was becoming not only a collective exercise but also an effective and useful mechanism accepted by all United Nations members. Albania thus supported and advocated the Universal Periodic Review mechanism as of the utmost importance to the promotion and protection of human rights as a basic feature of democracy. Albania also commended the role of civil society in the Universal Periodic Review process. India said that the principles of universality, equality and impartiality underpinned the Universal Periodic Review and its success depended on upholding those principles. Sufficient resources should continue to be afforded to the mechanism. India advocated the intergovernmental character of the Universal Periodic Review and remained committed to it. It hoped that the Universal Periodic Review would continue to foster genuine dialogue between States, noting that it should not be used as a platform for the imposition of certain thematic issues. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia said the Universal Periodic Review stood as a unique intergovernmental cooperative mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights. It was important for the third cycle of the mechanism to focus on the implementation of accepted recommendations, rather than on making new recommendations. Limited, focused and action-oriented recommendations were better, and States were encouraged to submit mid-term reports. The Office of the High Commissioner should be asked to provide a set of good practices for the implementation of recommendations. Ghana said the spirit of the United Nations Charter was that no States should be protected by the principle of non-interference in case of the mass violation of the rights of its citizens. The Universal Periodic Review was in the same spirit. Ghana said independent national human rights institutions and civil society organizations should be encouraged to participate more in the Universal Periodic Review process, in order to ensure that the States' views were not the only ones to be taken into account. Luxembourg said its mid-term report had just been finalized and was now available, and explained that this was made in collaboration with civil society and that it contained not only information on Luxembourg's achievements in the field of human rights, but also identified priority areas where progress remained to be achieved. Iran believed that the Universal Periodic Review was a unique mechanism in the human rights machinery that gave an opportunity to all countries without exceptions to have their human rights examined by the Council and, at the same time, to monitor human rights situations across the globe. The process should remain universal, independent and impartial. The Universal Periodic Review was an area for capacity building and technical assistance of Member States upon their request. Grenada said that the Universal Periodic Review made provisions for the administration of technical assistance to help States in the implementation process. Grenada believed in the importance of the mid-term report as a tool to monitor and measure progress in the implementation of recommendations. Therefore, Grenada made a voluntary commitment to prepare a mid-term report in 2017. Solomon Islands informed that the Government had endorsed the establishment of a Universal Periodic Review National Working Committee in 2014. The Committee had undergone a capacity building training which had been held in Octo ber 2014 with support from international partners. Solomon Islands would be submitting its second cycle report the following month. Universal Periodic Review Info said that the Universal Periodic Review brought opportunities to Governments that wanted to improve their human rights situations. Participation in the process, however, could lead to arrest and intimidation of civil rights activists. Civil society should be able to speak publicly without any repercussions. States and the Council had the primary duty to address reprisals against civil society. Cameroon Youths and Students Forum for Peace stated that national institutions had to advise the authorities on issues of human rights violations. It reminded that Norway's Universal Periodic Review contained many recommendations to tackle the right to privacy and access to justice. However, recently a non-governmental organization was prevented from finding recourse to justice. The Government of Norway should therefore address the issue. Human Rights Law Centre said that Australia was reviewed under the Universal Periodic Review in 2011. Despite some positive steps, implementation of many recommendations was stalled and the human rights situation had deteriorated in many key areas. The Government maintained its policy of mandatory detention for all people arriving to Australia by boat. New laws allowed the Government to return migrants intercepted at sea. International Educational Development Inc.regretted that the Universal Periodic Review had failed to address pressing issues in a number of countries, including in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, where most speakers failed to raise the issue of the on-going persecution against the Hmong people. Canners International Permanent Committee said freedom of expression was essential for the development of a democracy, and noted that freedom of expression, freedom of information, and freedom of religion were respected in Jamaica. United Schools International noted progress made in Honduras towards strengthening democracy, protecting the rights and cultural heritage of indigenous peoples, combatting gender inequalities, and overcoming extreme poverty. Centre for Environmental and Management Studies said that Mongolia had become a booming economy, thanks to the exploitation of its mineral resources. Not only were the country's economic indicators impressive, but the poverty rate had significantly decreased and other social indicators were praiseworthy. The reduction in poverty was due to the growth of life stock incomes. Mongolia was a tolerant society, guaranteeing freedom of religion. International Association for Democracy in Africa said Maldives had been a successful development story over the previous three decades. With a population of 300,000, it was a middle income country with positive human development indicators. The healthcare delivery in Maldives was organized through a four-tier system. The Government was committed to improving the quality and accessibility of the health services.

<titre>MASTERMIND OF TERROR KILLED IN GUN BATTLE; PARIS ATTACKS: THE AFTERMATH.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		THE suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks who was killed during a dramatic police shoot-out was linked to four foiled terror plots in France this year, the country's interior minister has said. 
		 Bernard Cazeneuve said French authorities had no information that Islamic State (IS) jihadist Abdelhamid Abaaoud was in France before last Friday's massacre which left 129 dead. Abaaoud, 27, died with his cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen who blew herself up following a major pre-dawn raid in the northern suburb of Saint-Denis on Wednesday. His body was identified based on his fingerprints.
		Mr Cazeneuve told a press conference that the French government was only informed by an intelligence service "outside of Europe" of Abaaoud's whereabouts on Monday. 
		 The jihadist from Belgium had returned from Syria in 2014 and had been involved in four of six foiled attacks in France since spring 2015, he added. 
		 The French interior minister said the six failed plots were all planned from abroad with the intention that they would be carried out by jihadists living in Europe. 
		 A suspected terrorist had confessed while under arrest that he had been trained by Abaaoud to carry out a "violent attack" in France or another European country, he added "It is urgent for Europe to come together, organise and defend itself against the terrorist threat," Mr Cazeneuve said. 
		 A French official said Aitboulahcen - believed to be the first female suicide bomber to hit Western Europe - detonated a suicide vest after a brief exchange with police officers. 
		 According to the official, one of the officers asked: "Where is your boyfriend?" and she responded angrily: "He's not my boyfriend!" before there was an explosion. 
		 The bodies recovered in the raid were badly mangled, with part of the woman's spine landing on a police car, complicating formal identification. 
		 Eight people were arrested following the raid which saw police fire about 5,000 rounds of ammunition as the terrorist cell barricaded themselves in the hideout. 
		 Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said the operation neutralised a "new terrorist threat", and that "everything led us to believe that, considering their armaments, the structured organisation and their determination, they were ready to act". 
		 The jihadis were set to carry out a second attack after Friday's massacre, this time targeting Charles de Gaulle airport and <mention id="1832">the city's financial district</mention> <mention id="1833">La Defense</mention>, according to reports. 
		 Salah Abdeslam, one of the suspected gunmen from Friday's attacks who is now the focus of an international manhunt, was not among those arrested, the prosecutor added. 
		 Belgian authorities yesterday launched six raids in the Brussels region linked to Bilal Hadfi, one of the suicide bombers outside the Stade de France. 
		 Meanwhile, French prime minister Manuel Valls warned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons, and urged an extension of France's state of emergency. 
		 He said: "Terrorism hit France, not because of what it is doing in Iraq and Syria ... but for what it is. 
		 "We know that there could also be a risk of chemical or biological weapons." 
		 Belgian police are also reportedly searching for a man named Mohamed K, from Roubaix, northern France, who is suspected of supplying the terrorist gang with explosives. 
		 The eight arrested included one woman and a man whose flat was used as a hideout by the terror cell and are being interrogated. 
		 Meanwhile, dozens of youngsters have called a UK children's helpline with fears that they will be victims of terrorist attacks following the Paris massacres last week. 
		 NSPCC's ChildLine reported more than 100 calls from children as young as nine who told counsellors they feared something was going to happen to them, were frightened to leave the house, and struggled to think of anything else. 
		 Some even said they feared the world was on the brink of a third world war. 
		 One 12-year-old girl told a ChildLine counsellor: "I have heard that Isis are in the UK and are planning a deadly attack. I don't feel safe any more and am having nightmares. These worries are in my mind all the time and I can't get them out." 
		 For some the issue is even more personal as a number of children from ethnic communities said they had been bullied following the attacks, with some even being told to "join Isis" - the terrorist group responsible for the weekend attacks. 
		 A 17-year-old girl told a counsellor: "I am scared to go to college tomorrow because of racist repercussions following events in Paris over the weekend. "People judge me because I am Muslim and go to mosque. I feel everyone thinks I am a terrorist even though I disagree with terrorist actions. 
		 "I wear a hijab and have suffered racist comments most of my life but when something like this happens you just want to hide." 
		 NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: "The attacks in Paris were atrocious, and our thoughts are with all of those who have been affected by these hideous attacks on innocent lives. 
		 "The avalanche of calls to ChildLine about this tragedy only adds to the feelings of fear and sadness that these evil attacks have prompted around the world. Many of the victims were young people and that will have heightened the fears of those who have seen others their age brutally murdered. "It is crucial that children can talk about their feelings following these senseless killings, and are given reassurance and support." 
		 Elsewhere in Europe, jittery leaders and law enforcement moved to protect their citizens as Rob Wainwright, director of the European Union's police co-ordination agency Europol, warned of "a very serious escalation" of the terror threat in Europe. 
		 In Italy, foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni said law enforcement was searching for five people flagged by the FBI in response to a US warning about potential targets following the Paris attacks. The US state department issued a warning on Wednesday that St Peter's Basilica in Rome, Milan's cathedral and La Scala opera house, as well as churches, synagogues, restaurants, theatres and hotels, had been identified as "potential targets". 
		 Danish and Norwegian police were asked to be on the lookout for a man who Swedish authorities said is wanted in connection with an investigation into "preparing for a terrorist offence". Sweden's security service, known as SAPO, said the request was not linked to the Paris attacks. 
		 In Belgium, where many of the Paris attackers lived, prime minister Charles Michel announced a package of additional anti-terror measures, and said 400 million euro (PS280 million) would be earmarked to expand the fight. 
		 Mr Michel told politicians that security personnel will be increased and special attention will be paid to eradicating messages of hate.

<titre>Several masked gunmen have stormed the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in Paris shooting indiscriminately; Eleven killed in attack at the offices of a French satirical weekly.</titre>
<auteur>MIKE PRICE</auteur>
<texte>
		Byline: Mike Price 
		 IN PICTURES: Masked gunmen stormed the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in Paris killing eleven 
		 Police said several masked gunmen stormed the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in Paris shooting indiscriminately. 
		 Eleven people have been shot dead in an attack at the offices of a French satirical weekly which angered some Muslims after publishing crude caricatures of Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
		Prime Minister David Cameron joined the condemnation of the attack, saying: "The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press." 
		 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the killings were a "barbaric attack on freedom of speech". 
		 "My thoughts are with the victims, their families and their colleagues," he said. 
		 The publication has launched a series of attacks on Muslim extremism and the last tweet on its profile 
		 In it he wishes everyone "good health". 
		 French president Francois Hollande said it was a "terrorist attack" which had left France in a state of shock. 
		 He said: "At this moment we have 11 people killed, four critically injured. This is not the final figure. 
		 "At least 40 people have been saved - we don't know the exact number of victims." 
		 He said the French government would be holding an emergency meeting at the Elysee Palace and the security level in Paris had been raised. 
		 He said: "We are looking for the perpetrators of this crime. 
		 "France is today in shock, in front of a terrorist attack. 
		 "This newspaper was threatened several times in the past. We need to show that we are a united country. We have to be firm, we have to be strong. 
		 "We are at a very difficult moment. Several terrorist attacks have been impeded during the previous weeks. We are threatened because we are a country of freedom. 
		 "We fight threats and we will punish the attackers. 
		 "Eleven people are dead. We will look for the people responsible." 
		 David Chour told the BBC from close to the scene: "A lot of people from the shops heard a lot of gunshots. 
		 "Two guys entered with Kalashnikov guns and shot the people. I haven't seen them directly but people around said they just went away. 
		 "People are very shocked. It is pretty serious." 
		 Local news outlets report the Secretariat General de la Defense et de la Securite Nationale has raised the status of its Vigipirate plan - the French national security alert system - to "alerte attentat", the highest level, across the entire Ile-de-France region around Paris. 
		 The shootings in the French capital come shortly after an outbreak of opportunist attacks in crowded spaces across France - prompting fears that copycat attacks could be launched in the UK. 
		 British security services are likely to be in contact with French counterparts once a clearer picture of the latest attack is formed. 
		 Late last month, a van burst into a Christmas market in the western city of Nantes , injuring 10 people before the driver reportedly began stabbing himself. 
		 In the eastern city of Dijon, a driver reportedly shouting ''God is great'' in Arabic ran down several people, injuring 13 before coming to a stop. 
		 Those incidents came after an attacker knifed three police officers in Tours before he was shot dead by one of the officers. 
		 The French government denied links between the attacks but announced plans to further raise security in public spaces, including the deployment of around 300 soldiers. 
		 Ed Miliband said he felt "horror and outrage" about the attack after Mr Cameron led condemnation in the Commons at prime minister's questions. 
		 "We stand in solidarity with the people of France against this evil terrorist attack by people intent on attacking our democratic way of life and freedom of speech," the Labour leader said. 
		 "We are united in our determination to beat them." 
		 London mayor Boris Johnson said: "Shocked and appalled by senseless attack at Charlie Hebdo - London stands with Paris and the people of France against this horrific scourge." 
		 Mr Cameron told MPs: "This House and this country stands united with the French people in our opposition to all forms of terrorism and we stand squarely for free speech and democracy. 
		 "These people will never be able to take us off those values." 
		 Videos have emerged from the scene in which repeated shots could be heard, while others cower for safety on a rooftop. 
		 In another video, footage appears to show a police officer getting shot at close range, before two masked men dressed in black get into a car. 
		 One excerpt, from journalist Martin Boudot on a building located near the magazine headquarters, appears to contain footage of one of the men shouting "Allahu Akbar" - meaning God is the greatest. 
		 Witnesses at the magazine headquarters have described the scene on social media. 
		 Peter Allen wrote: "Bullet holes and smashed windows all around scene of Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris. Police sirens non-stop as terrorist alert raised to max." 
		 In a statement, the Muslim Council of Britain said it condemned the attack. 
		 A spokesman said: "Whomever the attackers are, and whatever the cause may be, nothing justifies the taking of life." 
		 Gilles Boulanger, who works in the same building as the Charlie Hebdo offices, likened the scene to a war zone. 
		 He told the BBC: " A neighbour called to warn me that there were armed men in the building and that we had to shut all the doors. 
		 "And several minutes later there were several shots heard in the building from automatic weapons firing in all directions. 
		 "So then we looked out of the window and saw the shooting was on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, with the police. It was really upsetting. You'd think it was a war zone."

<titre>Paris mastermind 'killed in 4:30am firefight' as he plotted airport atrocity; Report: Abaaoud among dead in ferocious battle at gang's hideout; Jihadis were heavily armed and ready to attack grieving city again.</titre>
<auteur>ANDY LINES</auteur>
<texte>
		THE Isis monster who planned the Paris massacre was cut down yesterday in a hail of 5000 police bullets, reports claimed last night. 
		 French authorities could not confirm that Abdelhamid Abaaoud died in the ferocious shootout at a terrorist safe house in the suburb of St Denis.
		They could not even say for certain whether two or three suspects had been killed. 
		 A female suicide bomber blew herself up during the siege, the police used weapons which caused part of the building to collapse, and experts were still DNA-testing pieces of human remains recovered from the bloodsoaked rubble. 
		 But the Washington Post said two senior intelligence officials in Europe had confirmed Abaaoud's death. 
		 The French said the raid had smashed a terror cell poised to commit a new atrocity in Paris. Charles de Gaulle Airport and a shopping centre would have been targeted. 
		 Seven suspects were arrested. The French said neither Abaaoud nor Salah Abdelslam, who is believed to have escaped after taking part in Friday's attacks, were among those taken alive. 
		 More than 100 heavily armed police in black balaclavas and bulletproof vests stormed the top-floor flat on the Rue de Corbillon, not far from the Stade de France, under cover of darkness just before 4.30am. 
		 Intercepted texts and emails had indicted that Belgian-born Abaaoud was hiding out there. Officials had believed until yesterday that he was in Syria. 
		 Police outside the flat shouted to the woman, named as Abaaoud's jihadi cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen: "Where's your boyfriend?" She yelled back: "He's not my boyfriend!" The police again shouted: "Where is he?" Aitboulahcen screamed: "Help me! Help me!" then set off her suicide belt. 
		 Officers stormed the flat and apartment next door as bullets began to fly. They were held up by an armoured door, allowing the terrorists to shoot back. 
		 A terrifying firefight raged for about an hour, and it was almost seven hours before the siege was declared over. In all, the police fired 5000 rounds. 
		 Nearby roads and schools were closed. Police shouted at locals on the street when the attack began to get inside or take cover. 
		 Five police officers were slightly hurt. A police dog, a seven-year-old Belgian shepherd called Diesel, was killed. 
		 Prosecutor Francois Molins said the raid had unearthed "a total war arsenal, including assault rifles of the Kalashnikov model and explosive belts". 
		 He added: "A new team of terrorists was neutralised. 
		 "All indications are that, given their arms, their organisational structure and their determination, the commando of jihadis could have struck." 
		 French police said the gang had been planning to attack the airport and <meronyme id="1837">the Quatre Temps shopping centre</meronyme> in <mention id="1838">the La Defense business district</mention>. 
		 A woman called Sabrine, who lives with her baby downstairs from the flat, said she saw bullets flying and felt the whole building shake. 
		 She could hear the terrorists upstairs talking to each other, running around and reloading their guns. 
		 Neighbour Rachid Boucerrou, 65, leapt from his bed when the firefight began. 
		 He said: "The noise was incredible. I immediately went to the window. I could hear loud explosions and gunfire, it was rapid and prolonged. 
		 "Then there were some huge bangs. It sounded like bombs being detonated. I thought, 'We are in a war zone.' "I told my wife and son to get back from the window. We were scared there would be a gunman on the loose." 
		 Another local resident, Karim Hassi, 33, said: "I thought the world was ending and we would certainly die. The sounds were deafening. Police were shouting to us to get away from the roads and off the streets. 
		 "My family were absolutely terrified. Everyone here is living in fear." 
		 Molins said the building had been hit by so much fire that it was now at risk of collapse. All the windows of the flat were blown out and the outside walls were covered with bullet and blast holes. 
		 A body found inside had been "riddled with impacts" and was impossible to identify except by DNA tests. 
		 The flat's owner, Jawad Ben Dowt, 30, told reporters before police took him away in handcuffs that he had let "two men who came from Belgium" stay there two days ago. 
		 He said: "A friend of mine asked me to host two of his buddies for a few days. I said there was no mattress. 
		 "They told me, 'It's OK, they just wanted water and to pray. 
		 "I was asked to do a favour and I said yes. I was not aware that it was terrorists." 
		 Searches for other suspects continued across France. Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said there had been 414 raids in three nights. Sixty people had been arrested and 118 more put under house arrest. 
		 Police had seized 75 weapons including 11 heavy weapons, 33 long firearms and 31 handguns. 
		 In Belgium, police were hunting an Isis bombmaker known as Mohammed K who allegedly supplied the suicide belts used on Friday night. 
		 He was born in the French Antilles in the Caribbean and trained in Syria. Police said he was extremely dangerous. 
		 WE'LL BOMB WITHOUT UN: Pages 4 and 5 
		 I felt blast as terrorist died 
		 ANDY LINES at the scene 
		 THE huge explosion shook me even though I was 100 metres from the terrorists' lair. 
		 I instinctively crouched down, and a second later there was another large, shuddering bang. 
		 But it was several hours before I realised I had heard an Isis jihadist killing herself. 
		 It was a terrifying and chilling few hours before dawn in St Denis. 
		 I had never expected to see dozens of heavily armed security forces officers pile out of trucks on to the streets of one the world's most beautiful cities. 
		 It was clear just how serious the situation was. Even the young officers, clad in balaclavas and camouflage gear and bristling with weapons, looked apprehensive. 
		 As they marched on the gang's hideout, locals were out in the street walking their dogs. It was surreal. 
		 There were only a few reporters on the scene when the attack began, and the explosions at the start of the assault shocked us all. 
		 But as the hours wore on, the noise died down. And it started to become clear that the security forces had succeeded in their mission.

<titre>Paris: the first post-car metropolis Opening Shot</titre>
<auteur>SIMON KUPER</auteur>
<texte>
		In Lima next Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee will rubber-stamp Paris as host of the 2024 Games. By the time the Games begin, Paris will be transformed. "Vehicles with combustion engines driven by private individuals" could well be banned from the city by then, says Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor, whose responsibilities include urban planning. He gestures out of his office window in Paris's city hall at the busy rue de Rivoli. By 2024, driverless shuttle buses should be going up and down the road all day. Olympic visitors will see a vision of the post-car city. 
		 Anyone watching lorries calmly unload on pedestrian crossings in today's Paris will struggle to believe this. Paris is now dirty, chaotic, years behind the transport front-runners Amsterdam and Copenhagen and, according to its mayor, Anne Hidalgo, suffers 6,500 deaths a year from pollution. But that's largely because Paris was built pre-car, and never had the space for the 20th-century technology. Now, as private cars start fading out, pre-car cities will come into their own. Paris, capital of the 19th century, could be the capital of the 21st.
		The city is already unrolling the future: raising the price of parking, adding bike lanes and planning to ban diesel cars by 2020. Paris has all the qualities to become the world's first post-car metropolis. First of all, it's too dense for cars and, as ever more tourists pile in, it keeps getting denser. "Every inch of that road surface has to be maximised," says Ross Douglas, who runs Autonomy, an annual urban-mobility conference in Paris. "The first thing the city will want to do is reduce the 150,000 cars parked on the street doing nothing. Why should you occupy 12 square metres to move yourself? Why should you use a big diesel engine to pollute me and my family?" 
		 By 2024, driverless taxis will be making ride after ride, almost never parking. Paris's parking spaces will become bike or scooter paths, café terraces or playgrounds. 
		 The second reason Paris can change fast: France's car industry has been steadily shedding jobs since the 1980s. It's now too small to lobby hard against the future. Third, France has a 39-year-old tech-savvy president. Whereas his predecessors spent their energy saving dying industries, Emmanuel Macron intends to grab pieces of new ones, such as driverless vehicles. Fourth, Paris doesn't need private cars because it already has the best public transport of any international city, according to the New York-based Institute of Transportation and Development Policy. Visitors from clogged developing cities ride metro trains here goggling in amazement. Already, nearly two-thirds of the 2.2 million Parisians don't own cars, says Missika. 
		 True, the 10 million people in the suburban towns outside Paris rely more on cars. But, by 2024, most of them should have been weaned off. Wander around almost any suburb now, and somewhere near the high street you will find a billboard saying: "We are preparing the metro site." Grand Paris Express - Europe's biggest public-transport project - is going to change lives. It will bring 68 new stations, and thousands of homes built on top of them. The Olympics will help ensure it's delivered on time. Then driverless shuttle buses will circulate endlessly along main drags. (One is already being trialled at <mention id="1840">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1841">the business district</mention>. The only time it caused an accident was when a human driver took the wheel and hit a pedestrian's ankle.) 
		 New electric bikes will allow suburban cyclists to cover two or three times current distances, making long commutes a doddle. The Périphérique - Paris's ring road, which now cuts off the city from the suburbs - will become obsolete, predicts Missika. He looks forward to it turning into an urban boulevard lined with trees and cafes. 
		 By then Paris and the suburbs will have merged into a single "Grand Paris". Missika points out that the Olympic stadium and athletes' village in 2024 will be outside Paris proper, in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of France's poorest departments - just five minutes from Paris by train, but currently a world away. Missika says, "For me, the Games are above all the construction of a Grand-Parisian identity." 
		 By 2024, Paris will be the EU's unrivalled number one metropolis. I asked Missika if he expected Brexit to benefit Paris. He replied that he considered London and Paris a single city, "the metropolis". You can travel between them in less time than it takes to cross Shanghai. Anyway, he adds: "I have the impression Brexit won't happen, since the English are pragmatic. The moment when they say, 'We were wrong, we'll take a step back' will be a bit humiliating, but it will be better than doing Brexit." 
		 "Paris is again picking up," British architect Richard Rogers told me at last Saturday's FT Weekend Festival. Admittedly, the city won't be paradise yet in 2024. Soldiers with machine guns may still spend their days patrolling sleepy side-streets for terrorists, alleviating their boredom by eyeing up Parisiennes. But already, Paris is starting to regard its English neighbour with sympathy rather than envy.

<titre>Paris to build seven skyscrapers to lure financial business from London</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		Paris will build seven skyscrapers in <mention id="1842">its business district</mention> as part of an aggressive campaign to lure financial services companies from London after the UK leaves the E U. 
		 As much as 375,000 sq m of office space, the size of about 50 football pitches, will be built by 2021 as part of the city's wider efforts to "accommodate the new talent" coming to the city. Marie-Célie Guillaume, chief of Defacto La Défense, the body responsible for managing <mention id="1843">the financial hub in western Paris</mention>, said yesterday that it wanted to send a "powerful message to businesses that are uncertain about their future in London".
		Paris is vying with Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin to attract banks, insurers, start-ups and other companies worried about what will happen when Britain leaves the political bloc. Paris has been one of the most aggressive in its efforts. 
		 Immediately after the referendum on June 23, President François Hollande's Socialist government changed the tax rules for expatriates in Paris to make it more generous, and put together a high-level team to lobby global companies. 
		 On a visit to London on Tuesday, Emmanuel Macron, the independent French presidential candidate, said that he wanted British "banks, talents, researchers, academics" to move to France after Brexit. 
		 Bankers in the UK and France have expressed scepticism that Paris could become Europe's financial hub, citing the inflexibility of French labour laws, the language barrier and high taxes. 
		 They say, however, that some operations in London that rely on EU "passporting" rights to operate across the bloc could move to the continent. 
		 In January, HSBC became the first big bank to detail plans to move jobs out of London after the Brexit vote, confirming plans to move 1,000 roles in its investment bank to Paris. 
		 UBS said that about the same number of its London employees could be affected by Brexit, while Jamie Dimon , chief of JPMorgan Chase, said that more than 4,000 of his bank's 16,000 UK staff could be displaced.

		Jan du Plessis  
		 Heave ho  
		 Theresa May might be losing the confidence of parliament but the PM can still convene a roomful of business leaders. With only a few days' notice, more than 100 of them showed up on Monday night to toast the Brexit deal she'd sealed with Brussels the day before. After a scene-setter from new Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, a rapidfire presentation from Number 10 chief of staff Gavin Barwell and a few words from the PM herself, there was a bit of Q&amp;A. Many of the great and good were in attendance, including the City's key representatives on the PM's new business council for services — Paul Manduca, chairman of the Pru, and Shriti Vadera, who chairs Santander UK. Also there were high-octane figures from Aston Martin boss Andy Palmer to Goldman Sachs International chief Richard Gnodde. Most kept a low profile. But Jan du Plessis, pictured, the new BT chairman, took the prize for sycophant of the month, praising Mrs May's "tenacity and determination" and promising to urge fellow business leaders to "get behind the PM" and her deal. "You might have seen a couple of people with their fingers down their throat," one attendee told City Insider. A queasy double meaning to reports that the room was heaving. 
		Arnaud de Bresson  
		 Allez-retour  
		 The boss of Paris Europlace, Arnaud de Bresson, was over in London on Wednesday for the FT's Brexit and Beyond conference. The man whose job it is to woo business from the City to Paris did his bit to promote the merits of the French financial centre. But more impressive was the speed and efficiency of his commute. He spent the morning in Paris, attending the UN's launch of its responsible banking principles, before hotfooting it by Eurostar to his early afternoon session at the FT conference near Tower Bridge. Then back to Paris to see Paul McCartney's gig in <mention id="1845">La Défense</mention>. For all his keenness to see France profit from Brexit, he's hoping the frictionless travel is unharmed. Live and let die, as Macca might say. 
		 Jon Cunliffe  
		 Down at heel  
		 Never mind the 10.5 per cent slump in the economy that the Bank of England predicted on Wednesday would ensue in the event of a nodeal Brexit. Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, had urgent business to attend to. 
		 Finding perhaps that his shoes were not prepared for the biblical flood that Brexit will unleash (or at least leaked in Wednesday's drizzle), he repaired to Loake's, round the corner from the Old Lady of Threadneedle St. Minus his security pass unfortunately. City Insider encountered Sir Jon queueing with the plebs — and being subjected to the same search and security checks — before he was allowed back into the Old Lady's hallowed halls for the press conference that delivered that torrent of Brexit bad news. 
		 Reform Club  
		 No grousing  
		 To the Reform Club on Pall Mall for a good old-fashioned lunch with one of City Insider's oldest chums. The day was autumnal. The fires were roaring in the grates. But imagine the disappointment when said chum ordered the grouse, only to be told there was none. The combination of spring storms and summer wildfires killed off the grouse season almost before it had begun. Result: very few birds. And a 50 per cent jump in prices. "It's just too expensive," said the apologetic maître d'. "We've taken it off the menu." Happily, the pheasant did a valiant job of filling in.

<titre>SocGen investment bank aims to reinvent itself New chief on a mission to convince shareholders and clients of the merits of broadening out from equities derivatives</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE</auteur>
<texte>
		It has been 20 years since Société Générale gave up the quaint trappings of historic Paris for the gleaming practicality of its towers in <mention id="1846">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1847">the French capital's modern business district</mention>. 
		 Now, Séverin Cabannes, SocGen's new investment bank chief, is on a mission to convince shareholders of the merits of another pragmatic break with the past — reinventing his division around a broader base than the market-leading equities derivatives franchise that critics say is fading fast.
		The investment bank has been under fierce scrutiny following the March departure of Mr Cabannes' predecessor Didier Valet and a "watershed" first quarter where SocGen's equities revenues rose just 6 per cent while those of rival BNP Paribas were up 38 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs data. 
		 Rival bankers and former SocGen staff say its woes started much earlier, beginning with the departure almost 10 years ago of the star traders who created the bank's market-leading equity derivatives business, including Jean-Pierre Mustier, now CEO of the Italian lender UniCredit. 
		 "They lost some real leaders in the field who were instrumental in getting SocGen where they got to," said one equities professional who used to work at SocGen and now works for a rival bank. "It's a real, real shame for the amazing franchise that they had." 
		 SocGen is now Emea's [Europe, Middle East and Africa] third biggest equities operator by revenue, having lost its number one ranking in 2013, according to data from industry monitor Coalition. Its shares have fallen 23 per cent since March 1; shares in the benchmark Stoxx EU 50 banks have fallen almost 17 per cent over the same period, while shares in France's CAC40 have risen almost 1.5 per cent. 
		 In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Cabannes said he did not think equity derivatives differentiated SocGen any more, but that the bank must explain itself better. 
		 "I think we have still to do more pedagogic work," said Mr Cabannes, 60, who has been at SocGen since 1997. "In the first quarter we made a dedicated deep dive on our global market activities for our investors and analysts. It was very well received and I think we have to continue in that direction." 
		 The deep dive emphasised the extent of the fixed income business, which Soc-Gen deliberately began growing after the financial crisis because the bank believed it attracted a risk premium for being overly exposed to equities. 
		 Mr Cabannes stands by SocGen's attempt at reinvention by investing in fixed income at a time when almost every other bank was cutting it back, as well as SocGen's decision to limit risk exposure in the "unstable" markets of the first quarter, when volatility lurched from record lows to extreme highs and the lender "had a low risk appetite". 
		 SocGen — which will soon buy Commerzbank's structured financial and investment products business, EMC, according to people familiar with the matter — is trying to increase its penetration with corporate clients, who make up just 35 per cent of its existing base. 
		 Mr Cabannes also hinted that the bank could adjust its product focus to better fit the kind of market conditions that he blamed for its poor first quarter performance. "What we see today is you have more demand in flow products than in structured products," he said. "So, that is a question but it's not what we have really decided yet. Perhaps we can reweight a bit our flow activities compared to our structured product activities." 
		 But he was cautious on whether such an adjustment would yield meaningful results. He saw the conditions of the first quarter as transitory and as such had no plans for big shifts. "The problem we have is that the perception of investors takes time to be convinced," he said. "For me it's a very clear strategy we have continuously delivered and this strategy is still the same." 
		 Among analysts, scepticism remains high. "The first quarter was a watershed ... Banks printed money in equity derivatives, SocGen was weak relative to US peers and BNP," said one. "Fifteen years ago, I used to call it the Goldman Sachs of French banking: they had a bad quarter once every year, but their other three quarters more than made up for it." Now, "there's an opportunity for competitors to attack the franchise". 
		 Citi analyst Azzurra Guelfi said first quarter equities revenues were "a disappointment" and "management did not fully address market concerns in the call in explaining the reason for this weakness compared to peers". 
		 The investment bank's attempts at reinvention find a kinder audience internally at SocGen, which is in the early stages of a three-year plan to boost returns by cutting costs and accelerating a push into digital banking. 
		 "We are no longer what we were 10 years ago, a pure equity derivatives house," said Philippe Heim, the bank's deputy CEO and international retail boss. "We were the nerds in that space and we developed the business ... We had a great generation of guys inventing all the new products." 
		 Now, said Mr Heim, "we managed to turn this platform that was purely focused on equity derivatives products into a cross-asset derivative house". 
		 The scope of that revamped investment bank has been capped, since 2014, at 20 per cent of SocGen's group-wide capital, reducing the likelihood that the whole of SocGen could ever be rocked by a scandal such as Jérôme Kerviel's $7.2bn rogue trading spree. 
		 While there are no shortage of former SocGen insiders and rivals to question the bank's recent performance, and its pedigree, it remains Emea's third biggest equities operator, behind only JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. 
		 "Excellence is the clients' perception. We have a great perception from the clients still," said Mr Cabannes. "Ask the client, not the competition. They are necessarily negative. Don't ask our former colleagues who left the company. They are frustrated." 
		 One former colleague whose opinion could matter is UniCredit's Mr Mustier, who has been exploring a merger with SocGen. "Jean-Pierre Mustier represents a blessed era for SocGen and he's a man who rebuilt himself after Kerviel, so it's a double seduction," said one person who worked with him at SocGen. 
		 Shareholder concerns Litigation issues and management shake-up The poor equity-derivatives performance in the first quarter came during one of the bank's more turbulent periods. 
		 Didier Valet, Séverin Cabannes's predecessor, resigned abruptly in March over the recently settled Libor-manipulation litigation. The bank has also just agreed a settlement with US authorities over another case involving corruption and bribery of the Libyan Investment Authority. A third case to do with sanctions is still pending. 
		 The litigation overhang had weighed on the stock price, while investors were also questioning the bank's direction under chief executive Frédéric Oudéa. 
		 These shareholder concerns intensified after a management shake-up precipitated by Mr Valet's departure and the weak first quarter marked by the fading reliance on equity derivatives, which has removed some of SocGen's original identity and selling point.

<titre>City chiefs brace for a 'global battle for skills' Employment Urban leaders must prepare for a new working landscape, says Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson</titre>
<auteur>ANDREW EDGECLIFFE</auteur>
<texte>
		W ork has always shaped our cities; the world's great population hubs have provided pools of talent, suppliers and customers for business, and the towers of commerce still define skylines from Manhattan to Malaysia. But when work changes, how must our cities? "Fundamentally the cost of distance — the cost of moving goods and people — sits at the foundation of so much of what we do. Cities were invented to solve that problem," says Karen Harris, managing director of consultancy Bain &amp; Company's macro trends group. Yet as she and her colleague Andrew Schwedel wrote in a 2016 report, technologies from robotics and 3D printing to autonomous vehicles are eroding the cost of moving people, goods and information, accelerating change in the "monuments to spatial economics" we know as cities.
		Ms Harris argues that urban centres from Paris to San Francisco will always appeal to a group of "rich people and single people and empty nesters" who can afford them. Yet the fact that the middleclass bedrock of a city's workforce now has other options raises the question of whether cities can retain their competitive advantage as hubs for work. 
		 Forecasts suggest the world's big cities will not, in fact, lack labour. In the latest update to its World Urbanisation Prospects report, the UN predicted that the percentage of the global population living in urban areas — which rose from 30 per cent in 1950 to 55 per cent now — will hit 69 per cent by 2050. 
		 "What's happened in every revolution is a massive structural change in employment, but we don't have less employment," says Mike Sutcliff, group chief executive of Accenture Digital, a consultancy. 
		 Yet even the UN's headline prediction hints at the challenges cities face, from infrastructure and social services for growing populations of future workers to integrating immigrants with minimal social friction. Dig deeper and the scale of upheaval becomes more apparent. 
		 The biggest changes in the urban vs rural divide will not be in the economies that are most familiar to the largest employers, such as Japan and Germany, but in fast-developing countries like India, China and Nigeria that these organisations are learning to navigate. 
		 As they contemplate this prospect, business and civic leaders know that their existing workers, from cashiers to consultants, face their own disruptions. The advance of automation and artificial intelligence means as many as a third of all workers in the US may need to change occupations and acquire new skills by 2030, according to a new report for the US Council on Foreign Relations. 
		 If that is not to leave millions behind, increasing inequality, local governments will need explicit policies for training their workers, "creating better jobs and career paths for Americans", the report's authors concluded. 
		 If most of the jobs of the future will require more than a secondary school education, this is a challenge that city leaders can start working on now, according to Josh Lowe, who writes on the future of work for Apolitical, an online platform for sharing insights among policymakers and public servants around the world. 
		 "There are some things I think we know city leaders can be doing or areas they can be looking at to start preparing their populations," says Mr Lowe. "The first would be around skills and training, particularly around adult skills in the middle of their careers." 
		 Mr Lowe notes that cities are not only competing to attract big employers such as Amazon and Apple, with the prestige and tax revenues their big tech campuses offer. He says there is also a trend towards trying to lure businesses that can provide "middle-skill jobs" from healthcare to plumbing. 
		 The Dallas Federal Reserve has been among those to recommend better "middle skills" training in cities to close the skills gap, and Muriel Pénicaud, Emmanuel Macron's labour minister, is overhauling France's €32bn-a-year vocational training scheme to give every worker €5,000 to spend on courses of their choice over their careers. 
		 From Munich to Boston, Apolitical has also tracked city-backed retraining programmes targeted at women and minorities, groups which many studies predict will be hardest hit by automation. 
		 While Mr Sutcliff has seen Accenture's large corporate clients make similar investments in training, the growth of the gig economy may require that cities — rather than employers — help workforces navigate this transition. 
		 As Ms Pénicaud put it, "a global battle for skills has been launched". The opportunity for the cities that win that battle will be to reinvent themselves in a way that tempts even the mobile middle classes to stay. 
		 "The very technologies we talk about that are potentially eliminating jobs in some sectors ... create opportunities for many businesses," says Ms Harris at Bain. As craft breweries pop up in former manufacturing hubs, "there is something lovely about that cultural renewal", she adds.

<titre>Paris's passion for Japanese architecture A wave of new buildings is testament to the city's admiration for architects such as Shigeru Ban and Kengo Kuma. By Edwin Heathcote</titre>
<auteur>EDWIN HEATHCOTE</auteur>
<texte>
		R oland Barthes, while wandering the streets of Tokyo in 1966, noticed the Japanese culture of gift boxes. "Geometric, rigorously drawn," he wrote, "and yet always signed somewhere with an asymmetrical fold or knot, by the care, the very technique of its making, the interplay of cardboard, wood, paper, ribbon, it is no longer the temporary accessory of the object to be transported, but itself becomes an object; the envelope, in itself, is consecrated as a precious though gratuitous thing; the package is a thought." 
		 In Empire of Signs Barthes compared the tradition of Japanese packaging to architecture, in which what is important is the wrapping, often delicate but at the heart of which is empty space. He implicitly compared this to Tokyo itself, a complex, super-dense city with a void at its centre, the inaccessible imperial palace, the house of a man who is never seen.
		As an intellectual culture often more engaged with the sign than the signified, modern France has fetishised the minimal aesthetic culture of Japan, perhaps as an antidote to the rich, gilded rococo of its own built fabric. From the Impressionists through to Jacques Roubaud, Chris Marker, Michel Foucault and even Jacques Chirac, Paris has been gently marinated in Japanophilia. There had been successful Japanese national pavilions but the first permanent (and very visible) signs of this fascination on the skyline came during a wave of construction in <mention id="1848">the La Défense business district</mention> in the late 1980s, notably <meronyme id="1849">Kisho Kurokawa's Pacific Tower</meronyme> with its Zen-ish rooftop garden (1992) and <meronyme id="1850">Kenzo Tange's curious Grand Ecran complex</meronyme> (1991). Then, in 1995, came Tadao Ando's striking meditation cylinder at the Unesco building, with its hovering disc of a ceiling. 
		 And now Ando is back with another concrete cylinder. The conversion of the city's central Bourse de Commerce into a public gallery for the luxury goods magnate François Pinault is the latest surge in a sudden flood of Japanese architecture in the French capital. 
		 Last year Shigeru Ban completed La Seine Musicale concert hall on the Île Seguin. With its death-star dome and dramatic concrete interiors, this is very much a building in the city's tradition of grands projets. Ban's previous Parisian building, the delicate, translucent extension to the Musée du Luxembourg (completed 2011), was very different, featuring his characteristic use of cardboard tubes as a construction material. Meanwhile Kengo Kuma, having built the Pôle multi-équipements Macdonald, an impressive mixed-use college and sports centre, in 2011 is now at work on the huge Aurore scheme. A combined "eco-luxury hotel", performance space, offices, hostel and co-working space above the railway tracks at the Gare d'Austerlitz, it is scheduled for completion in 2022. In the renderings, it looks like a kind of bamboo-framed jungle, its hanging gardens and timber terraces having more of Bali in them than Rive Gauche. But it will certainly make an impact, as will Kuma's other major project in the city, an elegant-looking transparent and terraced building for the Grand Paris Express, the Gare Saint-Denis Pleyel (due 2023). 
		 Amid all this activity, the building that is making the most waves is Sou Fujimoto's Milles Arbres, a floppy pancake that straddles the Périphérique in the Pershing district. It will be, as its name suggests, crowned by a thousand trees, but it will also include a village of translucent houses amid the greenery. Fujimoto is also designing the delicate glazed and faceted École Polytechnique at the Université Paris-Saclay campus. 
		 And then, after all that, there's SANAA. The practice formed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa was arguably responsible for sparking this new explosion of Japanese architecture with their ethereal Louvre in Lens (2012), which has turned out to be one of the most memorable museums of the modern age. From its inception as a published design, its almost disappearing architecture generated a particular excitement in France, a renewed passion for the minimal Japanese aesthetic. 
		 It has proved difficult, however, to translate that architecture into Paris's fiercely protected streetscapes, and SANAA has been working on the rebuilding of the city's La Samaritaine department store for what seems an eternity. Originally scheduled to open in 2013, the design has faced opposition at every stage, with conservationists seemingly determined to put a stop to the arrival of contemporary architecture in the very centre of the city. 
		 Yet the design is hardly the kind of aggressive intervention that might be expected to raise hackles. What looks like a delicate net curtain is drawn around the structure, and its curving folds subtly echo the rhythm of the neighbouring building's structural grid. From the renderings at least, it appears to be a lovely thing. 
		 But perhaps the problems encountered in the construction of this building highlight precisely the differences between SANAA's home city of Tokyo and Paris — differences that help explain the yearning of the latter for the former. For Tokyo is everything Paris is not. Its architecture is unruly and unregulated, it is high-tech and highly illuminated, a sci-fi city of filmic intensity and churning change. It is a city of fleeting images rather than permanent physical fabric. 
		 Paris, on the other hand, has long been stuck in its own perfection, bound by strict codes that govern appearance, dimensions and materials. Its architects dream of Tokyo's easy- going attitude to the existing physical fabric. They yearn for an architecture of disappearance rather than solidity. Just as Barthes was seduced by a city of mysterious codes, contemporary Parisians have been attracted to a culture of ethereality. 
		 You might think that, in an era of globalised architecture, there is nothing unusual about a European capital boasting so many buildings by Japanese architects. But then you might look over the Channel to another capital, one that has always proclaimed itself to be more open to international influence and more welcoming of change — London — and find not a single work by a Japanese architect. In fact the only work I can think of that would qualify in the whole of the UK is a wall built by Tadao Ando in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens which is about to be demolished. 
		 It's possible that the waters of this architectural deluge might be receding. Not all recent designs have been universally welcomed — as witness SANAA's Samaritaine difficulties — while Shigeru Ban's Metz outpost of the Pompidou (which last year hosted an exhibition of Japanese architecture) is a far less elegant building than the Louvre's in Lens. 
		 Fujimoto's Mille Arbres design is also drawing criticism for its lack of public space. So just as we are about to enter the phase when so many of the results of this architectural amour will be opening, perhaps the affair with Japanese architecture is fading. 
		 As Roland Barthes wrote: "By its very perfection, this envelope, often repeated (you can be unwrapping a package forever), postpones the discovery of the object it contains — one which is often insignificant, for it is precisely a specialty of the Japanese package that the triviality of the thing be disproportionate to the luxury of the envelope."

		Toulouse v La Rochelle Sky Sports w, 8pm By Max Oram LA ROCHELLE deserve plenty of respect against Toulouse in the first Top 14 semi-final after they continued a recent trend towards playoffs shocks by beating Racing 19-13 at <meronyme id="1851">La Defense Arena</meronyme> last week, a venue where they had lost heavily in the regular season. 
		 However, rather than a wager on the Privateers to stay within ten points of the rejuvenated red and blacks at Bordeaux's Matmut Atlantique Stadium, back the top seeds to claim a third narrow success against La Rochelle.
		Toulouse, chasing a first domestic title since 2012, have lost only five games all season and two of those were at Leinster in the Champions Cup. As well as a 23-19 victory over La Rochelle at Stade Marcel Deflandre, there have been 12 away triumphs, ten by 12 points or fewer. 
		 They are playing a dynamic brand of rugby with Antoine Dupont, whether at scrum-half or fly-half, mixing seamlessly pack powerplays with livewire backline moves featuring hot-stepping South African full-back Cheslin Kolbe. 
		 La Rochelle struggled for rhythm when they lost last month's European Challenge Cup final 36-16 to Clermont in Newcastle and two years ago, when top seeds, they were turned over 18-15 by Toulon in Marseille. 
		 Recommendation Toulouse to win by one to 12 points 1pt 6-4 Betway, Boyles

<titre>Sephora plans store openings as it taps 'beauty revolution' Personal &amp; household goods</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW</auteur>

		France's Sephora is opening up to 150 stores a year as the LVMH-owned beauty and make-up retailer seeks to accelerate its global expansion and keep up with a "beauty revolution", according to its chief executive. 
		 "Our retail stores are thriving; they're alive, they're kicking," said Sephora chief Chris de Lapuente yesterday in an interview at the FT Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid. "We're opening between 125 and 150 stores every year, and we're constantly renovating our biggest and best stores."
		Sephora's investment in physical stores underscores the role it sees for bricks-and-mortar outlets to engage with customers, as part of an "omnichannel" approach that includes ecommerce and building an online community through social media. The regions that will have the most new stores are North America and Asia. Growth in China is forecast to double in the next few years. 
		 "What matters to us is to build wonderful relationships with our customers and the store is the place where these relationships are created and nurtured," said Mr de Lapuente. "Experiential retail is very much part of Sephora's DNA and we will continue investing in it." 
		 Sephora has enjoyed strong growth on the back of soaring demand for cosmetics and beauty products. 
		 LVMH does not break out Sephora's performance, but last year organic sales in the "selective retailing" unit that Sephora is part of rose 12 per cent to €13.65bn, excluding the closure of Hong Kong airport concessions in 2017. 
		 "It's an extraordinarily dynamic market," said Mr de Lapuente, a former longtime Procter &amp; Gamble executive who became Sephora's chief in 2011. "We're living in a beauty revolution." 
		 On Friday a Sephora store will open on Times Square in New York, its largest in the US. Last week Sephora reopened its second-largest store in France, in <mention id="1852">the Paris business district of La Défense</mention>, after a major renovation. It is due to reopen its largest store in the world, at the Dubai Mall, tomorrow following an extensive overhaul. 
		 Sephora stocks about 300 brands, including its own private label, in 34 countries. It has 2,500 stores worldwide and employs 40,000 people. 
		 Mr de Lapuente said that for Sephora "experiential" retail meant that "when customers come into the stores they have a wonderful experience".

<titre>Ad trackers on EU states' websites spark fears Technology. Privacy threatGoogle and 100 other groups monitor citizens covertly in apparent breach of data rules</titre>
<auteur>MADHUMITA MURGIA</auteur>
<texte>
		EU governments are allowing more than 100 advertising companies, including Google and Facebook, to track citizens surreptitiously across sensitive public sector websites, in apparent violation of EU data protection rules, a study has found. 
		 Danish browser-analysis group Cookiebot found ad trackers — which log users' locations, devices and browsing behaviour for advertisers — on the official government websites of 25 EU member states.
		The French government had the highest number of ad trackers on its site, with 52 different companies tracking users' behaviour. 
		 Google, YouTube and DoubleClick, Google's advertising platform, accounted for three of the top five tracking domains on 22 of the main government websites. 
		 Researchers also studied the websites for EU public health services, finding that people seeking health advice on sensitive topics such as abortion, HIV and mental illness were met with commercial ad trackers on more than half of the sites analysed. 
		 Nearly three-quarters of the 15 pages scanned on the Irish health service website contained ad trackers, while 21 different companies were monitoring a single French government webpage about abortion services. 
		 Sixty-three trackers monitored a single German webpage about maternity leave. 
		 Google DoubleClick trackers were found on health pages providing information on HIV symptoms, schizophrenia and alcoholism. 
		 Researchers found that while many governments mentioned Google analytics cookies, which are used to run the website, in their privacy policies, they did not disclose any advertising-related cookies. 
		 "Any website has a responsibility to inform their user about any data collection and processing happening on their website," said Eliot Bendinelli at Privacy International. "The fact that these websites ... can't comply with this basic requirement shows that the current tracking ecosystem is out of control." 
		 Many commercial trackers appeared to be gaining access to these public websites through backdoor tactics, including via social sharing widgets, such as ShareThis. 
		 "We found that a lot of adtech trackers were smuggling in other third parties through these plug-ins, without the consent of users or knowledge of the governments themselves," said Daniel Johannsen, chief executive of Cookiebot. "Although the governments presumably do not control or benefit from the documented data collection, they still allow the ... privacy of their citizens to be compromised, in violation of the laws that they have themselves put in place." 
		 Experts say the personal data that adtech companies are harvesting from visitors to EU government sites could be combined with data from other sources to draw detailed profiles of each unique user, which could in turn be sold to data brokers. 
		 "Browsing histories are very intimate information. They show what we're worried about, what our plans are, what we are interested in, our daily routines, the focus of our work," Mr Bendinelli said. "Government websites are ... a case that's especially concerning. They offer crucial information and services that people depend on and often can't choose not to use." 
		 Diego Naranjo, senior policy adviser at the civil rights organisation European Digital Rights in Brussels, said Cookiebot's findings raised questions about whether the public websites were in violation of the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation. 
		 "We need an analysis from EU data protection officers of how this behaviour is in line with GDPR," he said. "It's not obvious to me how this is based on any legal grounds ... It shows how pervasive and broken online ad tracking remains, and how urgently we need to fix it." 
		 Google said: "Our policies are clear: if website publishers choose to use Google web or advertising products, they must obtain consent for cookies associated with those products." Google did not permit publishers to "build targeting lists based on users' sensitive information, including health conditions like pregnancy or HIV". 
		 Facebook said the investigation "highlights websites that have chosen to use Facebook's Business Tools, for example, the Like and Share buttons, or the Facebook pixel. Our Business Tools help websites and apps grow their communities or better understand how people use their services. Facebook considers it the responsibility of the website owner to inform users of which companies may be tracking them."

<titre>Not all whites are farmers: privilege, the politics of representation, and the urban-rural divide in Zimbabwe.</titre>

		 Abstract 
		 Whiteness has always been visible and marked in Africa. This is what makes whiteness in Africa distinct from whiteness in the West. This article explores the question of how the visibility of whiteness matters for its politics by focusing on the case of Zimbabwe. Much of the work on whiteness in this country, concentrating solely on the white farming community, presents the white population as a homogeneous group. This article uses the urban-rural divide to challenge such a portrayal and to explore the relationship in Zimbabwe between the politics of representation and the politics of whiteness in the postcolonial era. Based on four years of ethnographic research, it investigates urban and rural whiteness together because they are interrelated. We make two specific observations: first, that urban privilege has remained invisible because white Zimbabweans and white privilege are imagined to be connected to the land and to being a farmer. Urban whites have perpetuated this stereotype, which helped mask their own privileged lives. Second, we demonstrate that the defence of white privilege happens through means other than simple denial. Our interview data shows that, despite urban whites' acknowledgement and understanding of white privilege, they still defend and try to legitimize it. Finally, we conclude that raising awareness and demanding acknowledgement of white privilege might be a necessary but insufficient condition to end it.
		Resume 
		 La blanchite a toujours ete visible et marquee en Afrique. C'est ce qui distingue la blanchite en Afrique de la blanchite en Occident. Cet article explore la question de savoir en quoi la visibilite de la blanchite importe pour sa politique en se concentrant sur le cas du Zimbabwe. L'essentiel de la recherche sur la blanchite dans ce pays, exclusivement axee sur le paysannat blanc, presente la population blanche comme un groupe homogene. Cet article utilise le clivage urbain-rural pour remettre en cause cette description et explorer la relation, au Zimbabwe, entre la politique de la representation et la politique de la blanchite au cours de la periode postcoloniale. Base sur quatre annees de recherche ethnographique, il examine la blanchite urbaine et la blanchite rurale ensemble parce qu'elles sont liees. Les auteurs font deux observations specifiques : d'abord, que le privilege urbain est reste invisible parce que les Zimbabweens blancs et le privilege blanc sont imagines lies a la terre et au fait d'etre agriculteur. Les blancs urbains ont perpetue ce stereotype qui a contribue a masquer leur existence privilegiee. Ensuite, les auteurs demontrent que la defense du privilege blanc se fait par des moyens autres que le simple deni. Les donnees d'entretiens montrent qu'en depit de leur reconnaissance et de leur comprehension du privilege blanc, les blancs urbains continuent de le defendre et de tenter de le legitimer. Enfin, les auteurs concluent que la sensibilisation et la demande de reconnaissance du privilege blanc peuvent etre une condition necessaire mais insuffisante pour y mettre fin. 
		 Introduction 
		 The invasions of white-owned farms in Zimbabwe in 2000 captivated the international media and community. The violence, the images of black Africans storming white compounds, and the storyline of white farmers being assaulted by black militants, proved irresistibly newsworthy. In the media, Zimbabwe's white population was represented in a particular way: as victims who struggled against the terrors of the Mugabe regime that was trying to dispossess them of their land (Willems 2005: 94-5). White Africans were portrayed almost as an endangered species that protected all that was good in Zimbabwe. In this romanticized vision, whites were seen as the protectors of nature, the backbone of the agricultural economy, and the guardians of those who work in it. (1) Some white Zimbabweans, writing their memoirs and personal accounts, could be seen as having used this groundswell of international support and sympathy: authors such as Peter Godwin and Alexandra Fuller, for example, became internationally celebrated (Pilossof 2009). 
		 Previously, scholars have questioned the media's framing--and the sheer quantity--of the coverage of these events, particularly in relation to the small number of white farmers in Zimbabwe and the limited scope of the violence (Chari 2013; Willems 2013). (2) In this article, we aim to explore this discrepancy further by looking at both continuities and differences between urban and rural whites in Zimbabwe. We explore the divisions between white farmers and urbanites, arguing against the simplistic misrepresentation of white power and privilege in Zimbabwe as exclusively tied to the ownership of land. Correcting such a biased and limited portrayal, this article presents a broader historical analysis of whiteness in Zimbabwe. The way in which this history is narrated has at its heart the idea of a white urban-rural divide: an idea that is underpinned both by different experiences of these groups and by the politics of representation. 
		 The distinction between 'urban' and 'rural' whites is an important but problematic one. It is not always easily drawn, and we do not treat them here as simplistically distinct categories. In part, the distinction is rooted in unique experiences. Life in the countryside was very different to that in the city, and these social worlds also changed in the transition from settler rule to independence. Complicating matters further, urban and rural whites represented themselves and each other in specific ways, which makes these categories consequential for the politics of whiteness. The aim is to replace the limited and biased portrayal of whiteness in Zimbabwe with a dynamic picture of the historical interplay between urban and rural white communities in the country. Starting in 1960, we analyse the relations between urban and rural whites, the actual differences in experiences, and the role of representation in their relationship. 
		 What this article adds to the literature on whiteness in Africa is that it shows how the visibility of whiteness matters for its politics. Whiteness has always been visible and marked in Africa. As Steyn has argued in the context of South Africa, this is what makes whiteness in Africa distinct from its counterpart in the West (Steyn 2007). The case of Zimbabwe illustrates how the politics of whiteness and representation are intimately connected. Whose power or privilege in the white community is visible or invisible and whose whiteness is represented as legitimate or illegitimate are central to the continuity and defence of whiteness. In Zimbabwe and Africa, and potentially beyond, the politics of representation is thus an essential part of the politics of whiteness and the continuous existence and defence of whiteness. 
		 This article consists of six sections. We start with a short discussion of the whiteness literature and follow that with a methodological segment. In the third section we cover the problem of the urban-rural divide in Zimbabwe, and in the fourth we analyse how political shifts over time made it opportune for the different white communities either to claim solidarity or to represent each other in negative ways. We analyse the real differences of the social and racial worlds of urban and rural whites and the politics of representation between these two groups, and show how, in combination, these have shaped the contentious political history of urban-rural relationships in the last forty years. In the fifth part of the article, we demonstrate how the land invasions in the 2000s opened up a divide between urban and rural whites. In the sixth and final part, we analyse urban white privilege and present a critical analysis of it, specifically of how urban whites themselves understand it. We find that urban whites readily admit their white privilege and demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of it, but nevertheless vigorously defend it. 
		 Whiteness in Zimbabwe 
		 Until recently, the white population has been largely absent from studies of postcolonial Zimbabwe. This changed after the farm invasions of 2000. Authors such as David McDermott Hughes (2010) and Josephine Fisher (2010) adopted the concept of whiteness and showed how its history is intertwined with exploitation and domination. They also skilfully applied it to counter cliched and colonial images of whites in the Western media and to explore the white experience more fully. For instance, McDermott Hughes demonstrates how Zimbabwean whiteness developed in relation to landscape rather than people. Deconstructing romanticized visions of white rural lifestyles, he shows how whites imagined the Zimbabwean countryside as a particular white landscape that symbolized white fantasy, violence and supremacy. 
		 These academics, however, essentialize the white experience in Zimbabwe as rural. Whereas they expertly rectify mystified notions about the history of white domination, their continued emphasis on white farmers reinforces stereotypes already present in news stories. The continued focus on rural whites reinforces the impression that whiteness in Zimbabwe is primarily centred on land ownership, labour relations, and identities tied to the rural idyll. Moreover, they suggest a cohesion of the community that, as this article elaborates, has waxed and waned and is often completely absent (Hammar 2012; Pilossof 2014). We therefore conceptualize whiteness as 'a configuration of power, privilege and identity consisting of white racialized ideologies and practices, with material and social ramifications', as noted by van Zyl-Hermann and Boersema in the Introduction to this part issue. This definition emphasizes that whiteness is not the same as 'being white' or as 'white supremacy' but rather always a specific configuration of its three components: power, privilege and identity. Whiteness can never be a single thing: at various moments in Zimbabwe's history, the configuration of whiteness differed for different communities. Furthermore, whiteness as a concept cannot simply be transposed across geographical contexts. We challenge in particular the idea, dominant in studies in the United States, that whiteness is often unmarked or invisible (Dyer 1997). Whiteness scholars have emphasized how privilege is often an invisible force--an advantage for whites that is rarely recognized and addressed. By contrast, whiteness in Africa is often hypervisible, and this has specific implications for its study and effects. Following Steyn, who made a similar argument in relation to South Africa (Steyn 2007), we demonstrate that whiteness is highly visible in African countries such as Zimbabwe. But scholars have to contend with how whiteness is marked and displayed, and what the implications are of the representation of whiteness. Steyn points out the way in which white South Africans have benefited from their privileges and at the same time have alternately obscured, denied and defended them (Steyn 2004). In this article we follow a similar argument in the case of Zimbabwe. While whiteness is symbolized through the stereotype of the white farmer, this has implications for the whiteness of his or her urban counterparts, who are very aware of their privileges but still defend them. 
		 The conceptual vagueness of whiteness in the literature on whites in Zimbabwe has, then, left us with a limited and partial picture of the community. A definition of whiteness that links power, privilege and identity to the way in which these are represented can assist us in tracing how the configuration between these three has changed over time in Zimbabwe, particularly in relation to the urban-rural divide. 
		 Methodology and sources 
		 This article is based on four years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with a range of whites in Zimbabwe. From 2010 to 2013, one of the authors undertook ethnographic research with white Zimbabweans. This research included interviews with farmers, ex-farmers and white urbanites in and around Harare, mainly focused on the farming experience since 2000. It was from this study that questions about the differences and divisions between urbanites and farmers emerged. To augment this body of data, and to get a better perspective on urban forms of privilege and power, the same author did follow-up interviews with twenty urban whites in Harare in 2014 and 2015. He also looked at the periodical called The Farmer to explore how farmers have presented relations between themselves and other whites. This magazine, produced by the main farming union, the Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU), was the most widely read and distributed farming periodical in Zimbabwe. It was published weekly from the 1950s until 2002, and is a rich and fascinating source, if not without complication. (3) Ideally, The Farmer magazine should be read alongside publications produced by the white urban constituency after independence in 1980. However, post-independence, practically no such publications existed, due to political pressures and the deliberate actions of white urban communities withdrawing from politics and public forms of engagement. The Farmer is one of the few sources to remain that directly served the white farming--or any--community across the country. Other publications for and by whites, such as Property and Finance and Illustrated Life Rhodesia, disappeared just before independence, while others broadened their scope to become more multiracial. The aim in using these various sources is to try to weave together various white voices to identify differences, convergences and frictions. It is impossible to understand the differences and continuities between what may be termed 'urban' and 'rural' voices without looking at both. Thus, they are presented in conversation with each other to get a better sense of the complicated historical relationship between the representation and identity construction of these two constituencies. 
		 Problematizing the urban-rural divide 
		 Despite the volume of research on white farmers, they were always a small minority in Zimbabwe. They were never more than 10 per cent of the white population, in a setting where whites were never more than 5 per cent of the total population. Their numbers dwindled dramatically: there were almost 300,000 whites in Zimbabwe in 1975, 120,000 in 1999, and only about 30,000 in 2010. Individual white commercial farmers numbered only 5,000 in 1975, 4,500 in 1999, and fewer than 200 in 2010 (Selby 2006: 59; Hammer 2010). In 2000, the total population of Zimbabwe was about 11 to 12 million (Central Statistics Office 2003: 5). The vast majority of the white population were not farmers but those who resided in urban areas--mostly Harare and Bulawayo, the two main cities. 
		 As Caute has commented: 'Most white Rhodesians were not pioneering farmers hacking down the bush and bringing the barren, arid veld to life. They were townsmen before they left Britain or South Africa and townsmen they remained after their arrival in Rhodesia' (Caute 1983: 88-9). As this suggests, it is inaccurate to draw too clear a distinction between 'urbanite' and 'farmer' because, in actuality, the two categories overlap in various ways. Many urban whites had friends and family who were farmers, or owned land outside the urban setting, and visited and stayed in these locations. Many farmers had houses in cities, and tended to retire and/or send their children to school there. Therefore, the two communities are and were interwoven to some degree. Further cross-cutting and blurring whatever urban-rural divide may have existed, class, religion and political outlook laid down other fault lines in white communities. Many whites, both urban and rural, were (or increasingly became) wealthy and had a high standard of living, which made them very mobile, regionally and internationally. To depict white farmers, as some media did, as 'isolated' and 'introverted' was incorrect, nor were white urban Zimbabweans necessarily 'cosmopolitan' or 'worldly'. Most had a range of experiences that mitigated simplistic representations. 
		 The divide between urbanites and farmers, although it had real valence, as the rest of this article will demonstrate, is thus not static or unchanging. Rather, these categories are cultural constructs that have been created historically and shaped by political events. This point has been widely accepted in the study of black labour migrants in Southern and Central Africa (Mormont 1990: 41), who were neither distinctly 'urban' nor 'rural' (Andersson 2001: 89--93). The dichotomy, in the case of labour migration, has been imbued with an array of ideological elements--with urban centres portrayed as symbols of human progress, whereas rural areas are seen as isolated backwaters providing materials and manpower, or alternatively with towns seen as sites of decay and perversion while rural scenes are depicted as pristine utopias (Andersson et al. 2009: 2; Ferguson 1999: 38-81). The point has been less clearly made in the region, however, for the divide between urban and rural whites. This divide, in the case of Zimbabwe, is similarly constructed and various moral significances have been similarly attributed to it. But this does not mean that it is completely unreal or lacking in consequence. 
		 Critically employing the idea of the urban-rural divide, we argue that it should be read as both real and rhetorical, and that its implications ought to be examined and evaluated. The distinction between white urbanites and farmers has a long history, which is related to the colonial history of Zimbabwe, events during the liberation war, Gukurahuncli, the land reforms in the 1990s, and the shocking nature of the land occupations post-2000. We start our historical analysis during the times of settler rule in 1960, and discuss the urban and rural social worlds, their economic positions, and their symbolic identification, all until 2000, when the land invasions happened. 
		 From cohesion to division: urban-dwellers and farmers, c. 1960-2000 
		 There have been significant differences in the social and racial worlds of urban and rural whites. In the colonial period, in particular, they lived in separate social worlds. The farm itself became the place for activities such as hunting, fishing and horse riding. Farming families depended on the farm for entertainment. Beyond that, social life often revolved around the local whites-only country club. Members of farming communities were isolated by large distances so gatherings were often organized around events such as school functions, recreational activities, or regional agricultural shows and the like. At the same time, farmers lived in close proximity to black servants and workers, who mostly lived on the farms in compounds. Domestic workers, often working long days and weekends, would also be in the family home. Farming memoirs note how the farmstead served as a place where there was constant visitation from workers who needed assistance with health issues, financial worries, family concerns and so on (Buckle 2002; Beattie 2008). 
		 For urbanites, the geographical realities allowed more interaction within the white community, but political and economic forces separated it from the black ones. Urban settings offered closer social contact between whites, but put up barriers and imposed and facilitated racial segregation. Whites lived in exclusive suburbs in urban areas, with good housing, gardens and social amenities. Cities also offered them greater variety in activities and less constraint in social norms than was possible on the farms (Godwin and Hancock 1996). Africans were largely confined to the rural areas, and those who did come to work in urban areas were made to adopt a migrant lifestyle and to live in hostels or domestic quarters while in town. Most lived in hostels that were meant to be exclusively male, while women and children were meant to remain in the rural areas. Increasing urbanization after 1950 resulted in the growth of large settlements for blacks adjacent to cities, and as the city grew these were often officially incorporated into the urban areas (Muronda 2008: 37-9). Settlements were euphemistically titled 'high density' (black) and suburbs were called 'low density' (white). 
		 After the Second World War, white Rhodesian settlers were keenly aware of the need to speak with one voice, in particular when it came to the colonial metropolis in London. 'Whatever objections an individual might have [had] toward the commonly declared interests of the settler population,' wrote Kennedy, 'it was [felt] essential that they not be allowed to jeopardize the outward display of white solidarity' (1987: 181). White Rhodesians deemed unity vital for presenting a front to the British in negotiations about the status of the colony. As independence was claimed across the African continent, the white settler community hoped to retain political power in an independent Rhodesia. 
		 During the period of political rebellion fostered by Ian Smith under the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) and the liberation war (1965-79), the state continued trying to promote unity--and display harmony--in the white community, and to have members of that community act as one in their defiance in the face of local and international pressures (Godwin and Hancock 1996: 15). The white community wanted to demonstrate that it could run the country independently of Britain, and could work with local African populations to allow a slow and gradual evolution of political integration that would eventually see majority rule come to Rhodesia. However, this could only happen, many white Zimbabweans argued, after a long and sustained period of white control. Various whites in Zimbabwe believed that they could follow the South African example and have an autonomous white-run state, or at least be conferred with dominion status like that seen in Canada and Australia (White 2015). 
		 White political power provided financial security for the white population. The government effectively set a 'floor' for the living standard of whites through which they could not easily drop. Wages were high for whites, and their quality of life was much better than that of blacks. Some whites were extremely wealthy, some relatively poor, but the vast majority could afford a standard of life on a par with or above that of whites in Europe (Godwin and Hancock 1996). Despite the need to present a united white political front and economic policies that benefited the whole white community, internal divisions between urban and rural whites lay just beneath the surface and gradually became more evident. Both urban and rural whites had the habit of representing each other in a negative way. During the 1960s and 1970s, farmers often viewed 'Salisbury as "Bamba Zonke" (take all), an unhealthy bloodsucker [city] populated by inferior types' (ibid:. 21). 'Take all' referred to the perceived manner in which urban whites were doing little for the country while living comfortably off the labours of the farmers. Farmers complained that urban whites were 'townies'--a derogatory term--and did not understand what life was like for farmers, particularly during the liberation war (Grundy and Miller 1979; Barker 2007). (4) Meanwhile, urban whites saw farmers as 'backward' and 'parochial'. Despite massive amounts of state support for farmers in the form of farming subsidies, price controls and tax incentives, urban whites felt that farmers were 'always whining' about issues such as labour, commodity prices and security, particularly during tough economic times (Clements and Harben 1962; 98; Godwin and Hancock 1996: 21). 
		 Following independence in 1980, the illusion of a cohesive white community slowly unravelled. Many whites left Zimbabwe, not wanting to live under a black government. In total, over two-thirds of whites left, and, unlike their counterparts in Kenya, almost all went to South Africa rather than to the United Kingdom (Caute 1983; Godwin and Hancock 1996). This changed the socio-economic demographic of the white community. Those whites who stayed were on average wealthier than the ones who left. The total number of white farmers fell by only 33 per cent in the first decade after independence and the number of white urban business and factory owners fell even less (Selby 2006: 118). Whites with valuable assets, properties and investments found reasons to stay. They were also reassured by Robert Mugabe's early reconciliatory rhetoric and actions during the 1980s, which seemed to guarantee their safety and economic fortunes. 
		 Whites who stayed felt a need to legitimatize their allegiance to the newly independent country, but urban and rural whites chose to portray this allegiance in different ways. Farmers started to represent themselves as vital to the national economy and committed to the new national project (Pilossof 2012). However, they also turned away from society and towards nature or 'the bush' as an expression of their 'Africanness' (Hughes 2010; Chennells 2005). (5) Urban whites largely withdrew from active politics and public engagement (Muzondidya 2009). They were confronted with the challenge of racially integrating, socially and economically, whereas they had lived the most segregated lives during settler rule. Neighbourhoods, schools, and sport and cultural venues desegregated and became sites for racial mixing. Most whites continued to live in the 'low-density' areas, but over time a small but growing new black elite joined them in these neighbourhoods. This had an economic effect: after independence, new interracial economic alliances and businesses were formed. As a consequence, a new urban black elite in cities rose alongside the existing urban white elite, whose sources of wealth were centred on business, finance and other forms of trade (Weiss 1994: 203). 
		 Initially, urban whites were concerned about the impact of integration and the subsequent effect it would have on the quality of services such as schools. However, in our interviews, they remembered their school years as a time of harmony and successful integration. Karl, for instance, who is in his mid-thirties, was born in Zimbabwe to an Australian father and Zimbabwean mother, and studied in Australia and the UK before returning home to work for an international NGO. He went to a government high school and said that he never felt tension between white and black children there: 'The schools I went to were well integrated, as was my parents' social circle.' To Karl, school integration mimicked the social integration happening among adult white urbanites. In those days, he recalls, urban whites identified with the nation and this was generally accepted. 'Acceptance as a Zimbabwean always felt like it was a given.' Sue also remembered how being an urban white started to mean having mixed social circles, and participating and collaborating with black Zimbabweans through culture, the arts and the theatre. (6) She went to a racially mixed government school for primary education and said that she really enjoyed her school years. She felt 'no racial tensions' and 'only after the land invasions in 2000' did she become aware of racial issues. 
		 Internationally, Zimbabwe came to be known as a postcolonial success in terms of racial integration (Muzondidya 2010). This image was primarily based on the representation of the new multiracial cities in the country. Urban whites started to identify themselves as 'new multicultural Zimbabweans', although at the same time many disengaged politically (Alexander 2007: 184). By contrast, political violence in the countryside confronted white farmers with a different reality, reinforcing the urban-rural divide. In Matabeleland and the Midlands, farmers became caught up in the violence of Gukurahundi from the early 1980s. Over fifty farmers were killed between 1980 and 1987. Nonetheless, the majority of farmers continued to do very well economically, a fact that increasingly stood out. By the early 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy had begun to face serious challenges. The country was forced to adopt an economic and structural adjustment programme (ESAP), an effort that was introduced --as it was across the continent--to resolve the economic woes caused by the state's excessive borrowing and a balance-of-payments crisis. A key tenet of ESAP was market liberalization. The plan encouraged capital Hows out of urban areas into rural ones, for both farming and tourist ventures. It allowed white farmers access to hitherto restricted yet lucrative export markets (Muzondidya 2009: 192-3). (7) Farmers became more and more associated with white power and privilege, as there never was a wealthy landowning black class alongside white farmers to share their success. 
		 Economically, the urban elite and the white farmers did well, but there was also a considerable proportion of the urban white community who felt that their financial security was eroding (Godwin and Hancock 1996). In particular, salaried whites battled with inflation and started to resent the success of white businessmen and, even more so, white farmers (Weiss 1994). In the early 1990s, these white urbanites started to openly accuse farmers of racism, casting them as the 'real' white racists. For their part, white farmers were aware of their problematic image. In 1991, The Farmer printed an article titled 'How others see us', where the 'others' referred to urban whites. (8) The article catalogued urban whites' sentiments about farmers. Farmers were depicted as being 'arrogant', 'simple', 'racially prejudiced' and 'the country's worst employers', even though they were also appreciated for growing food and bringing in valuable foreign currency. In return, farmers accused urban whites of being oblivious to the threat confronting farmers and how the realities of living in the rural areas had changed for the worse (Selby 2006: 160-77). Whereas ESAP had strongly benefited farmers, the passing of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act allowed the government to confiscate land for land reform without compensation. The government and its press began portraying white farmers as 'racist' and 'unZimbabwean' (ibid:. 122). The law focused public attention on the privilege of whites, but framed it in a specific way: as solely connected to land ownership. Many farmers were outraged by this move and declared that this policy would spell financial ruin for the country. They protested against the idea that they were the embodiment of white privilege and the main beneficiaries of the colonial system. In publications and press releases, they argued that over 80 per cent of white farmers had bought their land after independence, an argument that attempted to disconnect their present wealth from the historical injustices of settler rule (Pilossof 2016). However, during the 1990s, as economic problems in Zimbabwe mounted, farmers became synonymous with white privilege. 
		 The urban-rural divide and the land invasions of 2000 
		 The controversial and chaotic land invasions that started in 2000 put white farmers under direct assault from the government and its forces. Mugabe accused whites of controlling the land but also of being key supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Mugabe urged his party to 'strike fear into the heart of the white man', and blamed the whites for the economic and political troubles facing the country (Selby 2006:280). The scale of this assault and the violence associated with it caused widespread panic within the white community across the country (ibid.). Amid such a direct threat to their existence, farming representatives preached a message of unity and togetherness. (9) Farmers called for the white community to 'stand together' and 'be strong' in the face of this new challenge. (10) A number of letters from white urbanites were also published in The Farmer that expressed sympathy and support for the plight of the farmers: 
		  I cannot say that I know what the farmers must be going through, I only know that when and if Mugabe succeeds in stealing the farms he will then start on other businesses. That scares the hell out of me. Do not give up. You have plenty of support from whites and blacks in the cities ... we know who feeds us. (11)  
		 The land invasions created renewed feelings of shared white solidarity--or so the farmers initially felt. Farmers claimed that they experienced a warm and supportive reception from urban whites when they moved to the city. One farming couple who sought refuge in Harare during trouble on their farm wrote to The Farmer saying: 'Sir, may I bring to the attention of your readers the overwhelming support and encouragement farmers have received from the urban [white] community.' (12) Another farmer noted that 'the political climate has changed forever. Farmers are no longer universally seen as a selfish elite, but as victims of a murderous regime. We should be proud of our contribution to the economy and the upliftment of its people.' (13) The editor of The Farmer commented that people in town, black and white, were, 'perhaps for the first time ever ... sympathetic toward the nation's farmers'. (14) Most farmers who left their farms moved into urban areas in Zimbabwe. Selby noted that of the 3,500 farmers evicted by 2005, approximately 2,000 were in Harare, Bulawayo and Mutare (2006: 319). (15) 
		 The response of the urban white community was, however, more complex than this farmer-based perception suggests, as our interviews with urban whites demonstrate. Although the threat and violence led to some initial expressions of racial solidarity, as is evident from letters in The Farmer, many urban whites in our interviews offered a strong critique of the role of white farmers in the violence. Also, the violence never reached the city. Although war veterans initially targeted some white-owned businesses in the early 2000s, these actions were quickly stopped. The white urban populations were not subjected to the same treatment as farmers, their homes were not invaded, and there was no state-sponsored drive to evict and exile them. Urban whites blamed farmers for bringing the violence upon themselves, and dragging urban whites with them into the conflict. In a perspective that is radically different from that in the international media at the time, urban whites accused farmers of having failed to adjust to the new Zimbabwe and holding on to their white privilege and colonial attitudes. 
		 In our interviews, urban whites argued that they had worked hard to become a different kind of white community--less predicated on colonial whiteness, more adapted to the period of independence, more multicultural. For two decades now, they had identified with an image of racial harmony and said they were comfortable with the new realities of shared amenities and public spaces. They felt that the farmers were undoing their efforts. Patrick, who is in his mid-thirties, grew up in Harare and had several uncles who were farmers, recalled: 
		  Town whites tended to be less sympathetic [towards evicted farmers] ... with comments like 'Couldn't you see this was going to happen' or 'You guys made the wrong move politically [by supporting opposition parties] so what would you expect the government to do?' I think many thought the farmers had it coming, others thought the farmers deserved it, and I think still others thought that farmers were making life difficult politically and professionally for urban whites. I know some urban whites said farmers whinged a lot. (16)  
		 Indeed, we found little evidence in our interviews of sympathy for the plight of the farmers. Urban whites argued that farmers--given how they had retained their power, settler identity and colonial attitudes--had called the attacks upon themselves. Derrick, an urban Zimbabwean of South African extraction and long-time human rights campaigner, felt that the suffering of white farmers was overplayed, particularly internationally. He argued that the farmers used their white privilege to mobilize international sympathy, while at the same time bringing the whole white community into disrepute for drawing attention to whites and (inadvertently) to their continued privileged position in the country. He also contended that farmers were not the only ones put under pressure in the years following 2000. Civil servants, opposition supporters, unemployed workers, the urban lower class and evicted farm workers also faced hardships. 
		 White farmers certainly suffered, many urban whites admitted, but their wealth also assured them relative comfort after their evictions. Urban whites claimed that many farmers maintained a comfortable lifestyle due to the wealth they had accrued as farmers. Ben, a middle-aged lawyer who grew up in Harare and started working for farming advocacy groups in 2007, noted that farmers contended that they were earning more money in town, doing things such as importing fuel, than they ever did on the farm and that 'they should have moved into town ages ago'. (17) 
		 Urban privilege 
		 White farmers had become symbols of privilege. But the attacks on farmers allowed white urbanites to escape scrutiny and to avoid being represented in public debates, despite being no less privileged than these farmers overall. In the final section of this article, we therefore analyse in detail how white urbanites account for their power and privilege--in other words, how they define and defend their whiteness. From previous research, we know that white farmers, rather like Western whites overall, defend their privilege through denial (Pilossof 2012). For example, farmers argued that they were actually not that wealthy and that their success had come from their own hard work. Sacrifice and commitment, they said, made them succeed in turning empty, derelict land into fertile farms, and this work had benefited the entire country, rather than just themselves, in terms of food production and foreign currency earnings. Their rhetoric of privilege, in this sense, was very similar to that of white farmers in South Africa (Bernstein 2013). We found that urban whites differ from farmers in the way they defend and rationalize their privilege; they are more aware of it and less in denial. Nevertheless, they put up a vigorous defence. 
		 The majority of urban whites today acknowledge their race-based privilege. However, our interviewees identified this awareness about their privilege as a recent development, born out of the dramatic post-2000 events in the country. In the past, white Zimbabweans were rarely confronted with their privileged status at home. During the 1980s and 1990s, while the economy was seemingly functioning well, there was little racial and social tension, and those of privileged racial status were able to enjoy their standing and sense of entitlement with little embarrassment or concern. Tony, for example, is aware that he was given better treatment during the 1980s and 1990s merely because he is white. This was made particularly apparent to him during a trip to Tanzania in the early 1990s. He recalled: 
		  I remember being shocked when I [went to Tanzania], 1 actually got treated so ordinary in Tanzania. Like I was saying 'Excuse me,' like I am white, at least say hello to me more when I am in the queue, or say, 'Yes sir, can I help you?' In fact, whites were treated better by blacks for many years in Zimbabwe.  
		 Tony was always treated as if he were special for being white and deserving of white privileges, but in Tanzania whiteness was simply less revered than it was in Zimbabwe. His lack of awareness speaks to the success of urban whites' identification in the 1980s as 'multicultural Zimbabweans', an identity that helped camouflage their white privilege. In contrast to South Africa, majority rule thus did not immediately bring about racial awareness and the exposure of white privilege. 
		 However, Tony argues that things changed after 2000 in Zimbabwe. The change in economic fortunes of the country and the shift in the politics of race focused attention on the economic power and privilege of whites. Mugabe's campaign against the farmers in particular stigmatized whites as a privileged, land-owning group. Tony interestingly presents this development as a 'good thing', because 'some of the beauty' was 'that you were no longer special', even though, he says, it was all 'a bit hard to get used to'. (18) How was Tony able to see this as a positive development? One reason is that urban whites were not attacked in the same way that the white farmers were. But another reason is that their privilege continues to be unchallenged. Urban whites like Tony have become more aware, but this does not mean that they feel their privileges are being directly eroded. 
		 Mugabe's campaign specifically targeted white farmers for their privileges, but it made all whites, including urban whites, aware of these in a way that they had not been previously. Today, urban whites acknowledge this privilege, for mainly political reasons. First of all, they admit that they have an advantage in distancing themselves from white farmers, most of whom still deny their privilege. Urban whites want to demonstrate that they are a different kind of white, that they are aware, and that they understand black grievances. Politically, then, their acknowledgement of privilege is about proving their commitment to post-white supremacy Africa. Tony's acknowledgement--a sigh, almost--that it is 'a bit hard to get used to' has a whiff of nostalgia for the old white supremacy days. Thus, the acknowledgement of privilege and urban whites' awareness does not mean that urban whites like Tony have fully embraced this awareness--just that it is politically opportune to be aware of it. Urban whites feel politically vulnerable and therefore experience pressure to perform their recognition of white privilege, and possibly its rejection. They present a different white identity, but how permanently they will be able to sustain this is hard to say. 
		 Political changes made urban whites aware of their race-based privileges, but also gave them the sense of having lost the power to impose their will and assert their norms. Being white in social situations in the city is no longer always an advantage, and whites struggle to adapt to their changing position and to navigate their lower social status and position. Julie, an elderly white woman of Irish descent who moved to Rhodesia in the 1960s, similarly demonstrated this urban white effort to present a changed white subjectivity by explicitly identifying and rejecting white privilege. Specifically, she was mindful of being perceived as a 'white madam'--a woman of privilege who deserves to be treated with special regard. In the past, she explained in an interview, she would comfortably complain about poor or tardy service but today she feels 'reluctant to complain about things, because you are white, because you feel like it will be labelled as a racial thing'. She notes that the respect that used to be bestowed on her by blacks waned after 2000. (19) Like Tony, Julie senses a change in attitude among black Zimbabweans toward whites; whiteness has become visible and marked while simultaneously its status has diminished. She feels scrutinized and no longer entitled to make demands, afraid that this would be interpreted as imposing white privilege. 
		 Urban whites demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the role of white privilege through their life course and in social interactions. For example, Karl, the international NGO officer already quoted above, told us: 
		  Yes, I have to acknowledge that I have probably been afforded access to a wider range of opportunities, been less restricted, judged differently or less harshly than I might have been if I was another race ... In many small, but not insignificant, ways, I have probably been privileged by being white. Though, I have to say that any privilege that resulted from my race was not something that was ever expected or sought out. (20)  
		 Karl acknowledges his white privilege and is very specific about its various layers and how it plays a role in his life: from educational and economic opportunities to social interactions. Like other urban whites, he demonstrates an understanding of how white privilege has historically benefited white Zimbabweans in society in various societal spheres. However, he argues that because he never expected or asked for racial privilege--but nevertheless accepted it--he should be absolved of any responsibility for the benefits he may have received. 
		 Moreover, awareness and acknowledgement of white privilege--even if connected to the legacy of white supremacy--do not mean that whites do not try to legitimize it. Some urban whites, following old colonial and racist tropes, continue to argue that subservience is a 'natural attitude' for blacks. In their thinking, years of white supremacy and domination have left wealth in white hands but also inscribed a subservient attitude in the black mind. Frances is an elderly woman of British descent who was born on a farm but moved to Salisbury (Harare) for schooling and has lived there since. She felt that: 
		  because of ninety-plus years of white domination, black people were almost naturally subservient, [the] madam-boss syndrome. This, sadly, has almost been inbred in some communities and, yes, I do think that being white has privileged me. Especially now as an elderly white I am so often very humbled at the respect and courtesy shown me. (21)  
		 Frances acknowledges that being white conferred a form of undeserved respect and connects this to the history of white domination in Zimbabwe. However, she does not problematize her privilege. Rather than questioning her place and position in society, she is naturalizing her privilege to manage her white guilt. The lay psychological affliction of the 'madam-boss syndrome' is projected on subservient black Zimbabweans to legitimize her needs. Frances also argues that white farmers in particular are comfortable with this black subservience and almost expect such an attitude. White privilege is thus also projected onto the farmers, leaving her own urban privilege further unquestioned and unproblematized. 
		 Some interviewees argued that privilege is no longer limited to whites. It is as though they are claiming that, if privilege is shared between elites, it is less of a problem. They describe a shift from privilege defined by race to privilege defined by class. Sue is a woman in her mid-thirties who was born and grew up in Harare. She went to Australia for her university education but returned to Zimbabwe and spent many years working for a large arts festival. She says: 
		  I believe the lines are much more about income and social standing. I do, however, acknowledge that racism exists and therefore certain opportunities are only afforded to other whites, but feel that this is not unique to whites. Having lost my citizenship and with the current indigenization policies, I certainly do not feel that being white in Zimbabwe brings with it any privilege. (22)  
		 Sue is bitter about her falling status in Zimbabwe after 2000, which caused her to lose her citizenship due to changes in the Citizenship Act. These changes stated that, even if you were born in Zimbabwe, if one of your parents was born outside the country you were no longer a citizen and had to reapply. Urban whites such as Sue describe their privileges as eroding and connect this to the rise of a new black elite that has wealth and privilege. Sue presents herself as a victim who has lost her status due to indigenization policies. The black political elite's wealth is depicted as the new symbol of privilege and power. She describes the state's nepotism, patronage and corruption as the main problems. In this white, post-settler discourse, the new ruling elite is blamed for the ills befalling the nation, rather than the historical injustices of white supremacy that lie beneath the surface. 
		 Urban white privilege in Zimbabwe has remained invisible throughout much of recent history because white Zimbabweans are imagined to be farmers and are framed as such both in the media and in the academic literature. Historically, urban whites have perpetuated this myth--and possibly invented it--with the effect of masking their own privileged lives. However, in our interviews we saw that the political events in 2000 changed this. Urban whites have become aware of their privilege and today demonstrate a more thorough understanding of it. Yet despite their awareness and understanding, they still defend their privilege, although in a different way than the farmers do: not by denial but by naturalizing it or by pointing to the new black elite. The absence of denial raises important questions for our understanding of whiteness, where defence of white privilege is often equated with denial. 
		 Conclusion 
		 This article intervenes in the whiteness scholarship on Africa by exploring its relationship to the politics of representation in one particular case. It shows how the media--and scholarship--often present an essentialist and distorted picture of what it is like to be white in Zimbabwe, of the composition of the white community, and of the ways in which it wields its power and defends its privilege. It demonstrates that there is no underlying or overarching unity among the white community; solidarity within it has sometimes been illusory and has also waxed and waned over the course of a century. White farmers are only a small part of that community; although they have been connected in a variety of ways to its other--urban--constituents, political factors have increasingly created wedges to separate farmers from these town-dwellers. To overcome simplistic misrepresentations of white Zimbabweans, we have presented a more complete picture based on an historical overview of white urban and rural relationships and differences. We have exposed the origins and consequences of essentialized representations of whiteness, showing how the lived experiences and representations of whites play out against this historical backdrop. 
		 We have aimed to illuminate whiteness in Zimbabwe in two specific ways. First, we show how urban white privilege has remained invisible because white Zimbabweans are imagined largely to be farmers and white privilege is considered to be intimately connected to land ownership. Urban whites have tended to perpetuate this representation, which helped mask their own privilege as well as the privilege that many ex-farmers continued to experience even after they lost land during the post-2000 land reform process and moved to urban areas. Second, we show that the defence of white privilege happens through means other than denial. Our interview data shows that, despite urban whites' acknowledgement of their own advantage, they still defend and legitimize it. Politically, we can conclude that raising awareness and demanding acknowledgement of white privilege might be a necessary but insufficient condition to undo it. Whites will need to move beyond acknowledgement, become less defensive, and take more robust steps to undo the advantages they have enjoyed.

		 (1) We do not want to deny or diminish the severity of the violence that happened, but do want to place it within a broader context. Violence and intimidation were integral parts of the land invasions (Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO and the Justice for Agriculture Trust 2007). Since the land invasions began, over ten farmers have been killed on their farms, hundreds have been physically assaulted, and just about all, except for a few hundred who remain on their farms now, have been evicted from their homes and land. 
		 (2) To illustrate this, we carried out a search using Google on 22 March 2008 and compared the findings of 'farm workers' and 'Zimbabwe', 'land reform' and 'Zimbabwe', and 'white farmers' and 'Zimbabwe'. Farm workers received 5,700 hits, land reform 21,000, and white farmers over 827,000. These fairly novel attempts at quantification have a number of complicated flaws, but these simple findings illustrate that white farmers have received an embarrassing avalanche of coverage and attention.

		 (15) Some have pointed to the large exodus of whites from Zimbabwe after 2000 as proof of a wider attack on this group (Hammer 2010). This is problematic, because, while many whites did leave, most did so for economic and stability reasons rather than through direct targeting and forced relocation. Many of those who left still maintain connections to friends and families and visit during holidays, when there is a noticeable influx of white people (sometimes referred to as 'Christmas whites' by those who have remained).

<titre>Leaving London: voices from financial front line speak of foreign attractions Fewer than 1,500 jobs have shifted to Europe since the referendum but European banking hubs hope to lure many more</titre>
<auteur>FT REPORTERS</auteur>
<texte>
		In the 33 months since the UK voted to leave the EU, thousands of financial services companies with European hubs in London have been assessing their options. 
		 Many of them have concluded that the potential disruption of Brexit means they need to expand elsewhere in the EU, anticipating the loss of passporting rights that permit them to access clients across Europe.
		Financial Times research published last week found that the City of London's biggest international banks have moved fewer than 1,500 jobs from the UK in the run-up to Brexit, far fewer than originally estimated in many quarters. 
		 While relatively few people have shifted so far, rivals to London's crown as Europe's financial centre have been jostling to attract more Brexit escapers. Yet even the trickle of new arrivals is stirring concern about upward pressure on property prices and extra competition for places at international schools. The FT has spoken to people in six of the cities affected by these moves — Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Milan and Madrid — to hear how Brexit is playing out. 
		 Paris Stefano Petricca, pictured below, remembers where he was when he realised that his fledgling London-based asset manager would have to pack its bags and head to the continent. 
		 "I was watching the referendum on local TV ... I immediately understood that it was going the wrong way — immediately," he said in Paris while setting up his new life. 
		 The 53-year-old Italian native is the founder and chief executive of Petricca &amp; Co Capital, a €700m asset manager, which he set up in London four years ago. 
		 To guard against the potential disruption of Brexit, he started planning a move to the continent as soon as the referendum result landed. 
		 He fired a handful of staff and uprooted his life, writing off the cost of obtaining UK licences. 
		 He chose Paris because of its top cultural attractions, as well as its established financial market infrastructure and its close travel links to London. 
		 His move to the French capital has been mirrored at larger banks and asset managers, with Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and a host of others shifting operations there. They were lured to Paris in part by a low-tax offer made by French president Emmanuel Macron. 
		 "We have seen an acceleration of teams being moved to Paris ... there is still uncertainty and people are still waiting, but the plans are there and the first teams have been put in place," said Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, a French business lobby group that estimates some 20,000 jobs are shifting there from London. 
		 The moves are pushing up property prices and fuelling competition for scarce places at the city's best international schools. "We were able to increase the number of school places in Paris by 1,000 to close to 11,500," said Charline Avenel, who administers four major school districts around Paris, including Versailles. 
		 "The planning began two years ago, after the referendum," said Ms Avenel, pointing to a new school with an international section opening at Courbevoie near <mention id="1853">the business district of La Défense</mention> that has guaranteed school places to the European Banking Authority's staff as it moves from London to Paris. 
		 <mention id="1854">Prime office space in the centre of Paris</mention> is also already scarce, with Brexit only adding to the pressure. "In the most sought-after areas of Paris the vacancy rates are at a record low of 1.7 per cent," said Philippe Perello, a Paris partner with Knight Frank. 
		 The same is true for high-end apartments. "There is a scarcity in the market ... in the classic arrondissements, like the 16th, with a good stock of Haussmannian apartments, some with gardens, and close to the good schools, prices have jumped by over 5 per cent since Brexit," said Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, who works at Belles Demeures specialising in luxury real estate. She has been inundated recently with requests from bankers moving from London to Paris. 
		 Mr Petricca is searching for an apartment in Paris and although he "prays for a second referendum" his own move is now set in stone. "You know why; because I had to start to prepare lawyers and accountants to move one year ago." David Keohane in Paris Frankfurt In the coffee shops and bars of Frankfurt's financial district that surrounds the city's old opera house, talk of Brexit has been drowned out by a different, yet equally contested topic: the merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. 
		 Both banks have their headquarters in the German city, and they are expected to sack tens of thousands of employees if the deal goes ahead. 
		 In the long run, Brexit is likely to affect Frankfurt more fundamentally than Deutsche's potential absorption of Commerzbank. But for now, little has changed in the sleepy city of 730,000. 
		 Since the Brexit vote in 2016, more than 45 financial institutions have set up or beefed up their presence in Germany, the vast majority of them choosing Frankfurt — including the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered. 
		 "Frankfurt is the first choice for Brexit banks," said Gertrud Traud, chief economist of Frankfurt-based Helaba, a state-owned bank that is tracking the process closely. 
		 The total assets banks hold in the city are expected to rise by more than a fifth this year as they relocate several hundreds of billions of euros from London. The clearing volume of euro-denominated derivatives such as interest rate swaps — close to zero when Britain voted to leave the EU — has jumped more than tenfold last year alone. 
		 For now, lenders are only moving "the bare minimum" of jobs from London to Frankfurt that they need to satisfy regulators, said Joachim Wuermeling, a Bundesbank board member. 
		 "There will be a second wave, but at the moment it is very difficult to assess how big it will be." 
		 Most banks have been hiring locally for any extra jobs in Frankfurt. 
		 "We have a number of employees ready to move instantly in a hard Brexit situation, but so far almost no one has made the plunge," said a Frankfurtbased employee at a large US investment bank. 
		 Germany's financial capital, which lacks London's global buzz or Paris' cultural flair, has done little to woo banks. Mayor Peter Feldmann, a left-of-centre Social Democrat, avoids the sector. 
		 The federal government in Berlin has, however, promised to make it easier for banks to fire highly paid senior staff. 
		 While partly driven by Brexit, the boom in Frankfurt's commercial and residential real estate market is mainly caused by low interest rates and a strong local economy outside of banking. 
		 Residential rents are up 58 per cent since 2014, and commercial rents for premium office space in prime locations were up 7.3 per cent last year alone, according to BNP Paribas Real Estate. 
		 Expectations of tens of thousands of extra finance jobs have been scaled back. Helaba's latest estimate is that by the end of next year, Brexit will have pushed the staff employed by foreign banks up by 2,000 to about 4,500. Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt Dublin was in the grip of an acute financial crisis when Barry Mangan left the Irish capital for London a decade ago. By the time the JPMorgan Chase executive returned last year, the Irish capital was booming again and set for an influx of Brexit bankers. 
		 Mr Mangan, who is in his mid-30s, is chief risk officer at JPMorgan's payments unit in Dublin's docklands financial centre. His own move was not directly linked to Brexit. But it came as concern grew that an influx of bankers would squeeze both property and school spaces. 
		 Data from IDA Ireland, the state investment agency, suggests that Brexit-related projects will create more than 5,000 jobs in an already accelerating economy. 
		 Although Mr Mangan had heard "horror stories" about Dublin's hot housing market, he and his wife managed to buy a home after six months. 
		 "It took some time, but nothing crazy," he said. 
		 Dozens of companies have already made Dublin their EU hub as the UK prepares to leave the bloc, and this shows no sign of slowing down. 
		 EY, the accountancy firm, reports that 28 financial services groups have committed to relocate staff or operations to Dublin since the 2016 referendum. Among them are Citigroup, Bank of America, Barclays, Legal &amp; General and Axa. 
		 More than 100 companies have sought Central Bank of Ireland authorisation to operate in the country and IDA Ireland said 70 new investments are linked directly to Brexit, many outside the financial sector. 
		 Yet John McCartney, research director with estate agents Savills Ireland, said many companies were setting up in Dublin with only small teams. 
		 "They're finding out about the city, seeing how the land lies ... If the need arises, they will be in a position to scale up," he pointed out. 
		 William Tighe, a director with Dwellworks, a specialist international relocation agency, reported a "sustained uplift" in business due to Brexit, adding that the rise in "actionable relocations" has been in the thousands. 
		 Places are scarce in Irish state schools, leaving many people to turn to fee-paying institutions. "We're seeing more placements into private schools and the international schools as a result of these transferees coming in," said Mr Tighe. 
		 Rents are expensive, with prices in the swishest Dublin suburbs on a par with London or Paris. But the surging house price inflation that took hold after the crash has eased. Residential prices rose 5.6 per cent in the year to January, slowing from 11.8 per cent in the previous 12 months. 
		 Mr Mangan added he was glad to be back in Dublin, saying that non-Irish colleagues who have moved to the city are "generally very pleasantly surprised" at "how vibrant it is and how lively it is". 
		 Arthur Beesley in Dublin Bye-bye to Britain Dutch, Italian and Spanish cities also in mix for people exiting UK For Harm Bots, the new head of Royal Bank of Scotland's expanded Amsterdam office, one of the best things about the Dutch city is its proximity to London and other European financial hubs. 
		 "I can get up in Amsterdam and catch the 7 o'clock flight to London City and still be in the office by 8am, sometimes beating my colleagues who are commuting in London," said Mr Bots, who recently returned to the city he left 14 years ago after stints in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and most recently London. The new head of RBS's Dutch subsidiary NatWest Markets NV is among the hundreds of bankers leaving the UK to work for new European entities. 
		 Despite its benefits, including the fact that English is widely spoken, Amsterdam is unlikely to become a hub for investment banking. One factor holding it back is the rule capping bankers' bonuses at 20 per cent of fixed salary — in effect a tenth of what others earn elsewhere in the EU. Nonetheless, several trading groups — including CBOE Europe and the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise platform — have picked Amsterdam as their post-Brexit hub, as has Japanese bank MUFG. 
		 In Italy, hefty tax breaks by the former Renzi government have lured many Italian financiers back from London. 
		 Davide Serra, founder of a fastgrowing $12bn investment company in London, was an outspoken supporter of the former Renzi government. But the 48-year-old said the tax breaks were not the primary motivation behind his recent decision to move back to Milan with his family from London. 
		 "I have contingency plans," said Mr Serra. "I can move anyone into any major jurisdiction, depending on what Brexit turns out to be. I am hoping for the best but prepared for the worst." 
		 For now, his Algebris business, which specialises in banking investments and makes a third of sales from Italian clients, remains anchored in London with offices in New York, Milan, Luxembourg and Singapore. 
		 Sebastián Albella, head of Spain's securities regulator, has a number of theories why the trickle of post-Brexit bankers moving to Madrid has been below expectations. 
		 He blames a sense of instability caused by the conflict in Catalonia and a lack of tax breaks for companies such as those other countries have used to attract international banks looking to set up new EU hubs. Still, he noted that "the game is not over yet", pointing to the arrival of bankers from Credit Suisse and a number of smaller institutions. 
		 Credit Suisse is expected to move about 250 staff to Madrid, the largest influx of bankers into the Spanish capital, as the Swiss bank establishes an investment banking hub paired with its other main continental European base in Frankfurt.

		 ABSTRACT 
		 In recent decades, Kinshasa and Brazzaville have given rise to movements of prophecy, messianic fervour and revival (Pentecostalist in nature) in the field of religion. The patterns of liberation and deliverance that can be discerned here reflect forms of identity politics in which Africanity, in the ethnic and national sense, is not only a major issue, but a component that is increasingly associated with armed conflict. These processes express a radical paradigm shift that we place within the context of the relationship between Africanity and religious pluralism that has become evident in these two religious areas in recent years. The term 'Mboka Mundele' (the village or country of the Whites) points to an experience of 'colonial modernity', and allows us to describe in objective terms the current urban context in which these 'businessmen of God' emerge. Fernando Kutino, Ntoumi, Yaucat Guendi and Ne Muanda Nsemi are four major politico-religious figures who embody an ideology of Africanity related to complex types of 'magic' and processes of pluralization.
		RESUME 
		 Depuis quelques decennies, les champs religieux kinois et brazzavillois donnent a voir des mouvements prophetiques, messianiques et de reveil (pentecotistes) dont les schemas de libEration et de delivrance traduisent des politiques identitaires pour lesquelles l'africanite, au sens ethnique et national, est non seulement un enjeu majeur, mais une composante de plus en plus associee a des conflits armes. Ces dynamiques expriment un changement de paradigme radical que l'on met en perspective au regard du rapport entre africanite et pluralisation religieuse qui se donne a voir, depuis quelques annees, dans ces deux champs religieux. Significative de l'experience de la " modernite coloniale ", l'expression Mboka Mundele (le village ou pays des Blancs) nous permettra d'objectiver le contexte urbain actuel au sein duquel Emergent ces " hommes d'affaires de Dieu ". Fernando Kutino, Ntoumi, Yaucat Guendi et Ne Muanda Nsemi sont quatre figures politico-religieuses majeures dont on verra qu'elles incarnent une ideologie de l'africanite liee a des " magies " et a des processus de pluralisation complexes. 
		 ********** 
		 In recent decades, Kinshasa and Brazzaville have given rise to movements of prophecy, messianic fervour and revival (Pentecostalist in nature) in the field of religion. The patterns of liberation and deliverance that can be discerned here reflect forms of identity politics in which Africanity, in the ethnic and national sense, is not only a major issue, but a component that is increasingly associated with armed conflict. In the context of long-term history (histoire longue), one may be tempted to read this as a continuation or resumption of Kongo forms of prophetic activity that were in evidence throughout the precolonial and colonial periods (Balandier 1953; Asch 1983; Mokoko-Gampiot 2004; Melice 2011). However, although the ethnic and spatial fragmentation and promiscuity at the heart of these political and religious disputes are largely dependent on colonial borders and/or intermingling, the internal conflicts to which these ethno-identity dynamics lead are the expression of a radical change of paradigm. And this paradigm depends on the postcolonial situation (Mbembe 2001) that we will be interpreting via the logic of the spatio-temporal and social dovetailing that shapes these religious spaces. 
		 While these churches preach a living God and the possibility of human beings playing a part as the actors of their own lives, and while they exhort people to break out of the pattern of misfortune and failure and to believe that nothing is impossible for those who believe, they are also the cause of social divisions, and lead to a process of breakdown of the kind witnessed in the accusations of witchcraft that have burst onto the scene since the 1990s. Although these processes are not identifiable from an institutional point of view, they are linked to transversal tendencies that are developed in different ways by pastoral idiosyncrasies: we will address these tendencies in terms of territory and its socio-historical reconstructions. 
		 In this sense, we would like to investigate the relationship of civilizational exteriority suggested by the way in which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Congolese town was given the emic name Mboka Mundele, the village or country of the Whites, by its Black inhabitants. From a historical and socio-anthropological point of view, this relationship of exteriority could be linked to another, one established by scientific thought: the exteriority of the term 'religion' (1) vis-a-vis African civilization (Marshall 2014). 
		 In both Congos, religion was, indeed, designated by Nzambe (God), a term that was varied in many different ways through its identifications and its functions. At the historical level, Nzambe was thus identified as 'Nzambe ya ba Catholics' (the Catholic Church), 'Nzambe ya ba Protestants' (the Protestant Church), 'Nzambe ya Bakongo' (the Church of the Bakongo), Kimbanguism, Matswanism, the Prophetic Mission of Lassy Zephirin or 'Nzambe ya ba Makwa' (the Mission of the Cedar). All these names are part of a logic of pluralization of ethnic identity. On a more functional level, Nzambe, understood as religion or church, refers to a historical centre of socialization with a certain modern cast in matters of economics, politics, culture, medicine and health, albeit one that also has a link to mortality since it is the main place where death is socialized. 
		 If we can agree on the fact that the term 'pluralization' suggests a context in which monopolies collapse, we can deduce that the term 'religious pluralism' refers to the idea of a religious market that is solidary with other markets (in health, education or development, but also in death, sex, guns, politics, identities, and so on) and therefore other plural supplies of goods and services, material or symbolic. In this context (the updating of religious pluralism in this particular space), Mboka Mundele involves a questioning of the functions of socialization as it affects death, the economy, politics and the ethnicity of churches. Indeed, although the term Mboka Mundele (which once meant the city in contrast to the village) is no longer used by the inhabitants of the two Congolese capitals, a thorough examination of the plural figures of Mundele, as an agent of Africanity, can explain the processes of competition, influence and differentiation at work in this cross-border religious field. 
		 What is involved here is not a perspective comparing Brazzaville and Kinshasa, but an updating of the logics common to a space whose geographical boundaries, as inherited from the late nineteenth century, do not exhaust processes of continuity and fluidity (Gondola 1997). Connected by permanent 'flows' of populations, products and spirits from an 'Africanized' Christianity, the two Congolese capitals present us with a picture of a market that is both unique and cross-border. Among other examples, we may cite the countless Christian television channels of Kinshasa that broadcast to Brazzaville, or the all-powerful 'Christian Community of Women Messengers of Christ', which was created in Brazzaville in 1990 but is based in Kinshasa (Missie 2006). On the other hand, the diaspora territories forged over the last few decades by migratory and missionary movements comprise politico-religious extensions that make the Kinshasa and Brazzaville spaces part of a transnational territory. 
		 The data presented here are part of research conducted separately in Congolese religious circles for several years. Longer or shorter periods of immersive research were conducted in some forty churches in these two cities. Semi-structured interviews and the monitoring of the Congolese press, both religious and non-religious, through the internet have formed the bulk of the empirical material of this article, sometimes supplemented by participant observation in the private spaces of practitioners and leaders. These data form part of a much broader framework of research involving other places in the country, in Central Africa (Tonda 2002; 2005) and in Europe (Demart 2008; 2013), but these areas will not be addressed in this article, nor will the processes internal to the field, the relationships between churches or the practices of their members. 
		 AFRICANITY IN MBOKA MINDELE 
		 From the 'native' perspective suggested by the expression Mboka Mundele, the relationship between Africanity and religious pluralism informs a conceptualization of the experience of 'colonial modernity' (Stoler 2002; Cooper 2010). The perspective suggested here has nothing to do with any idea of the postcolonial 'incommensurability' (Chakrabarty 2008) of the 'vision' of the natives. Rather, we would like to show how the contemporary forms of Mboka Mundele, the city, inform Africanity as an operator of religious pluralism as well as the identity dynamics shaping spaces that were organized historically as required by the needs of the Mundele, 'the White', a figure that is plural in its historical essence. So it is on the basis of the relation between, on the one hand, Africanity--a word that suggests ideas of 'tradition', of 'ancestral character', of 'authenticity' and thus of 'cultural particularism'--and, on the other, Mundele that we will be examining the native experience of the 'Cruel City' (Beti 1954) in religious fields as being inseparable from the political field. 
		 The plural figure of Mundele 
		 The political space has comprised the first market of the production of death and its deadly identities since at least the advent of the global and neoliberal era and its various types of 'magic', of which Pentecostalism is an essential modality (Comaroff and Comaroff 2010; Tonda 2001). But, insofar as they are Mboka Mundele, Brazzaville and Kinshasa were produced according to the principle of the economic consumption of the black labour force by the colonial market. 
		 This market, which had forcibly replaced the native markets, was conceptualized in the African imagination according to a logic of sacrifice rendered by the term Mundele and its variations: Mundele Ngulu (the White as pig), Mundele Mwinda (the White as light), Mundele Ndombe (the White Negro) and Bula Matari (the state). 
		 So Mundele is a concept that expresses more than the physical person of the 'White'. Thus, in Kinshasa, and to a lesser extent in Brazzaville, the story of Mundele's functions was noted at the beginning of the twentieth century, with the Whites turning the Blacks into pigs whose flesh, reduced to a pate, is consumed from tin cans (Lomami Tchibamba 2007). This story of the cannibalism of the 'Whites' did not spare missionaries, especially the Catholics. This was a tacit accusation of witchcraft that, according to Melice (2011), was also to favour the advent of the Kongo prophet Simon Kimbangu in the early twentieth century. Kimbangu was known as the 'Black Christ', and his elevation to martyr status, like that of the Kongo prophetess Kimpa Vita who preceded him (in the early eighteenth century), would be permanently associated with the emergence of an 'inculturated' Christianity in both Congos. 
		 The figure of Mundele was also conceptualized in the notion of Bula Matari (the 'breaker of rocks'), a nickname given to the explorer H. M. Stanley and generically designating 'territorial administrators, colonials, soldiers and police' (Lomami Tchibamba 2007: 317)--the colonial and postcolonial state. In addition to the deadly violence of the colonial era, it is the mixture of ethnically differentiated populations that the plural figure of Mundele came to represent. For it was on the building sites of Mondele Ngulu or Bula Matari, as well as in its churches, schools, barracks and clinics--in short, those places where they experienced the practices and ideologies of Mundele--that these Africans also experienced a certain ethnic pluralism of identity. (2) 
		 But this power that could consume bodies and devour the flesh of the Blacks deployed a predatory activity following the biopolitical recruitment of the production of urban spaces, which were marked by a plurality of people whose identities were not only ethnic. This biopolitics simultaneously divided and mixed the dead and the living. Structured both by a strong symbolic logic (the economic sacrifice of the flesh of the Blacks, the coexistence of the dead and the living) and by plural logics of ethnic identity, these spaces were destined to serve as places in which ethnic powers could nest. This dovetailing resulted both from Africanity and from religious powers shaped by market logics, the logics of an enduring 'material dispute'. 
		 The constructions of Africanity 
		 Within the colonial context of pre-independence the figure of Mundele Ndombe (Black-White) emerges: this referred to those 'Africans who mimic, to a ridiculous degree, the habits and attitudes of Europeans' (Lomami Tchibamba 2007: 333; Mulumba 2007). The terms in which the Europeans are described constitute a severe criticism of the 'White Negro'. This criticism also forms part of a demand for Africanity aimed at emancipating Africans from their ridiculous behaviour and their 'aping' (Martin-Granel 2010) of Whites. This idea was already being voiced by the prophets, (3) who saw religious and political emancipation as dependent on the advent of a strong and true Africanity brought about by a rereading of the Bible, and is being taken up by contemporary prophetic and Pentecostal trends, but in a quite different way since the new birth is accompanied by calls for a clean break with 'traditions', the past, kinship, and so on. 
		 The requirement of 'emancipation' through Africanity was also a topic, during colonization, to which colonialism and its churches (Makiobo 2004) devoted much thought. In this sense, Africanity as a world of normative meanings for ethnically differentiated populations forced to share the same living spaces imposed itself as the product of the relationship between Africans and the world of norms of the Mundele, Bula Matari and 'his' God. 
		 In Brazzaville and Kinshasa--the capitals of the two states keen to 'become modern'--'Bantu socialism' (4) and 'resorting to authenticity' (5) were unable to impose the 'African' development being advocated, since the levers of the national economy were in the hands of the Mindele. (6) In other words, these 'African values' could not break away from the White domination that had created Brazzaville and Kinshasa in accordance with its need for a labour force (Gondola 1997). This logic explains why, across borders, the first leaders of the political market were, ethnically, the Bakongo, who were quicker than the Teke to enrol in the colonial labour force in all areas of colonial modernity, including the 'religious innovations' that marked the 'inculturation' of Christianity and influenced postcolonial politics. 
		 Thus, Africanity emerged as an ideology that was inseparable from the historical experience of the ethnic and religious pluralization of identity on Mundele sites; and Mundele was a power imagined or experienced as a power of death (Mundele Ngulu and Mundele Mwinda), organizing Mboka Mundele in accordance with its need for the consumption of the indigenous labour force and based on the principle of 'command' (Mbembe 2001). As an ideology with prophetic or messianic connotations,7 Africanity would establish its bearers as figures who, without distinction, were political, religious, economic, national and ethno-national, struggling against the death principle of Mundele power. 
		 Postcolonial heterotopias 
		 At the current time, one could say that Brazzaville and Kinshasa still operate according to the scheme described by the indigenous concepts of Mundele Ngulu and Mundele Mwinda. Thus, in Kinshasa, the crowded cemeteries, the abandoned corpses in the morgue and the permanent malangas (mourning rites) can lead to talk of necropolises and thanatocracy (De Boeck 2009). To a lesser extent, the same situation has been observable in Brazzaville, especially after the wars of the 1990s and 2000s. Therefore, the reconstruction of the religious market in these two cities in recent years appears to be closely linked to their characteristics as necropolises or heterotopias, (8) one of whose forms is, significantly enough, the cemetery. (9) 
		 The coexistence of the living and the dead that reconstructs Mboka Mundele in comparison with the 'village of the dead' can be read as an extreme manifestation of much broader processes that make the city a place of religious socialization and the politicization of death (Vangu NGuimbi 1997; Tonda 2000). Religious socialization is evident in the family's enforced disengagement in the treatment of death by a plurality of groups, including the forms of solidarity established by the churches. The 'Cruel City' is imposed here as a 'dead city', an other place produced by the system of Mundele, and partly reproduced and 'governed' by Papa-pastors who establish and multiply these other places or heterotopias--in people's homes, where the dead are displayed before burial; in the streets, through which the funeral processions pass; and in the courtyards of morgues, public buildings and stadiums, among other places. This involvement of religious charismata in the pluralization of the treatment of death occurs, significantly, at the same time as we see emerging new forms of pluralization of those who cause death; militiamen and soldiers, 'child witches' (De Boeck 2000) and 'night husbands', whose relationship with religious pluralism can easily be observed. The emergence of so-called child witches in Kinshasa's urban space is emblematic of this relation. Not only is it contemporary with the media explosion of the 'work of God' (Tonda 2002), but it aligns with the business carried out by the revivalist churches (Pype 2009; 2011; Demart 2013; Demart et al. 2013). The process of the production of childhood as a 'scourge' is, for example, largely the result of an unregulated current in the 'Revival' in which the persecution of witches and an Africanity that is seen as evil are inseparable. 
		 It is in this context that strong, literate personalities, socialized in the 'world religions' in Weber's sense, and in 'revolutionary' or 'authentic' single parties that are distinguished by ethno-nationality, are emerging as 'the businessmen of God'. Fernando Kutino, Ntoumi, Yaucat Guendi and Ne Muanda Nsemi are four politico-religious figures who embody an ideology of Africanity related to complex types of 'magic' and processes of pluralization. Their biographical trajectories bring out the 'logic of accumulation' (Dozon 1995) and capitalization of these prophets, in terms of power, knowledge and assets, which almost inevitably brings them face to face with actors in the political market. We have also decided to focus on their strong investment in public and media space and their extraordinary ability to mobilize crowds around a certain form of Africanity. 
		 ARCHBISHOP KUTINO: FROM PROSPERITY TO CONGOLITY 
		 Coming from the Ministry of Fepaco-Nzambe Malamu, who took him in when he was 'crazy', and later a pioneer in bringing the gospel of prosperity to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Archbishop Kutino revealed himself to the public in the late 1980s. This was partly thanks to the support of a very wealthy Dutch evangelist, Johan Maasbach, who placed the first Christian radio and television channel at Kutino's disposal. The social success that was displayed for many years by 'Archbishop Kutino', the head of his television and radio channel and an important member of the SAPE, (10) reflected a luxurious lifestyle that included frequent trips to Europe. The Kinshasa pastor is apparently of Angolan origin, although he mainly showcases his spiritual origins so as to demonstrate the power of Jesus. The fetishistic practices of his Kongo parents demonstrate Africa's inability to escape poverty and mediocrity, while his piety and faith in Christ justify his own social and economic success. 
		 In 2003, a new discourse started to make itself heard. The context was that of the 'transition' marked by the assassination of Laurent-Desire Kabila (in 2001), the accession of his son Joseph Kabila as transitional president, the war of Ugandan-Rwandan aggression that began in 1998, and the Sun City Agreement of 2002 (which, among other things, recognized the Churches of the Revival in the form of the ERC--Eglise du reveil du Congo--as the sixth denomination in the country). This period of transition continued into 2006, with legislative and presidential elections that were eventually held in 2006. Returning from a trip to Europe and the United States, the Archbishop launched the programme 'Let's save Congo' on his television channel. This 'patriotic revival', as it is called, gained a vast audience among the Congolese population. 
		 Very soon, however, the Archbishop focused on the figure of the President, who was held responsible for the Rwandan aggression that had been taking place since 1996 in the east of the country. He repeated the charges made in 2001 by Honore Ngbanda, (11) a sworn supporter of Mobutu but one who had been 'cleansed' in the Churches of the Revival (12) and who, from his exile in Paris, accused Joseph Kabila of being Rwandan. Without going into the details of this politico-religious scheme of deliverance, where the figure of diabolical evil is located within the self (be that 'self' individual, cultural or national), we will note that the churches' accusation of witchcraft, drawing its full impact from the climate of suspicion, would permanently leave its mark on political debate; in 2006, as in 2011, opposition candidates would counter the mopaya (the foreigner), who was more or less implicitly accused of being a Trojan Horse for the war, with the slogan 'mwana mboka' ('child of the country'). (13) 
		 Above all, from 2003 Archbishop Kutino would experience legal problems that eventually landed him in jail. In June 2003, he organized a rally in Kinshasa, following which a police raid took place on the premises of his TV channel. Material was destroyed and broadcasting halted for six months. Kutino then went into 'forced' exile in France, where he established a parish of his church. On his return to the DRC in May 2006, the Archbishop was given a hero's welcome as a symbol of Congolese resistance. He organized a 'thanksgiving service', after which he was arrested in his office in possession of weapons of war. 
		 In June 2006, the press disclosed that the military court had sentenced Kutino to twenty years in prison, to serve a minimum of ten years without parole, for 'inciting hatred, illegal possession of weapons of war, criminal association and attempted murder' of another pastor. The sentence was upheld on appeal in 2008 on the basis of the attempted murder of Pastor Ngalasi, whose church was nearby. The press then referred to a settling of accounts between the pastors over a 'land issue', while the population was outraged by the indictment of the Archbishop. In the eyes of the faithful, and for much of the public, his trial confirmed their suspicions that the head of state seemed to be attempting to 'silence' the man of God. However, at the same time, the charges gradually revealed the details of the disappearance of the mabonza (offerings) supposedly invested in the purchase of the plot of land. And so, for others--often those who were not members of the revivalist churches--Archbishop Kutino was a swindler and an adventurer, and his theology of prosperity was mainly perceived as an instrument for making himself rich and the population as a whole poor. 
		 In the DRC, as in the diaspora, pastors and Christians of the Revival mobilized to denounce the violation of Kutino's human rights (Demart and Bodeux 2013). Amnesty International issued several reports. Demonstrations were held in support, in Kinshasa and in the diaspora, denouncing the political machinations at work. In Kinshasa, some demonstrators were arrested. The ERC was divided: for its leading pastors, the 'Congolity' of the head of state was not in any doubt, or at least was a secondary issue compared with his political plans (restoring peace and leading the country into elections). These pastors, often from Katanga, as was the head of state, were then accused of corruption and of a betrayal of Kutino, a founding member of the ERC. In the churches of the ERC, members were often caught between two ideological and political positions, and some reached a compromise by abstaining from voting. In 2014, the Archbishop was granted a presidential pardon. He left jail transformed, emaciated and apparently in very poor health. 
		 We cannot go into the details of the trial here, nor into the different trends of the Revival that this conflict revealed and reshaped, but it is important to note that the Archbishop's history makes explicit his penchant for weapons. A first prison sentence of eight months with no remission in 1996 followed the revelation that he had not only weapons of war but also politico-religious links with Mobutu's supporters, if not the intelligence services. (14) But the shift from a theology of prosperity to 'patriotic revival' renders intelligible a shift in the 'blockage' (15) and a significant change in the location of the Africanity that needed to be resisted. This movement refers to the material dispute that was created by the theology of prosperity but that was also illustrated, in a concrete way, by the case of the plot of land. Was this a sort of repetition of the primal scene of conversion to the God of the Mindele, the provider of material power (Mbembe 1993; Bayart 1998)? How, then, can one avoid suggesting that there is an inextricable link between material, political and spiritual powers in the wars waged against the Devil in the 'territories of deliverance' (Demart 2010), and, beyond that, in all markets of the occult, just as there is in the diamond or coltan markets, (16) continuously expanding since the beginning of a neoliberal era that was defined as the end of the era of borders? In the rhetoric of tradition, with the fetishistic practices that are closely linked to it and comprise a 'blockage', is this material dispute (le contentieux materiel) not the idiom of a power struggle mainly involving the state, accused of siding with the enemy because of the assumed foreign origin of the head of state? The trajectory of Pastor Ntoumi in 'the other Congo' supports this hypothesis through his social and political ascent as a result of an 'opposition', manifested here by an unprecedented use of arms. 
		 PASTOR NTOUMI: THE 'ENVOY' OF TERROR AND RECONCILIATION 
		 Formerly known as Frederic Bitsangou, until 1997 Pastor Ntoumi looked after the health of the mentally ill whom he gathered from the streets of Brazzaville and treated in his church in Bakongo. In 1997, when (on 5 June) war broke out between the militia of General Sassou Nguesso and that of Pascal Lissouba, Bitsangou, the so-called 'envoy', emerged as someone who was at once a military, political, ethnic and mystic figure. His ability to inflict death on a massive scale was then added to his roster of abilities and charisma, and to the way in which he capitalized on them. 
		 On 15 October 1997, the victory of the militia troops of Sassou Nguesso, helped by Angolan troops and by the flight of Bernard Kolelas, Pascal Lissouba's Prime Minister and founder of the Ninjas militia, led Pastor Bitsangou to organize militia violence in the Kongo region of Pool, in the south-east of the country. His militia comprised his patients and also young men, the majority of whom were former Ninjas militiamen of Kolelas, himself endowed in the collective imagination with the aura of the extraordinary prophetic and messianic powers of the Kongo tradition. 
		 As the press wrote in 2007, 'guru and healer, he [Ntoumi] reigns over this army of barefoot soldiers who indulge both in armed terror against the population and in the construction of basic infrastructures (i.e. schools, clinics) and various manual trades which bring in substantial revenue'. (17) 
		 The politics of death and the material dispute that guided the military-religious action of terror spread by Ntoumi and his mystical and mystified soldiers are expressed in journalistic rhetoric in the common terms of a tribal or ethnic Africanity. We need simply note that this terror is not only directed against government forces; it also falls on the 'ethnic kinsfolk' (the 'populations') of the leader and his fighters, which helps us understand the inherently ideological character of such rhetoric. The terror of Pastor Ntoumi appears, indeed, as an ethnically anti-kinsfolk terror that thereby turns child soldiers, militias called Nsilulu, into 'child witches' who violate the bodily integrity of their 'kinsfolk' with their physical and sexual weapons. 
		 On the level of the political game, Ntoumi would be defined as 'a friend of the United States and President Bush, whom he contrasts with President Sassou Nguesso, who in his view is supported by France'. (18) It was in the name of this 'friendship' that he would demand the presence of US officials (19) at the negotiating table, which resulted in the agreement of 17 March 2003. (20) Thus, a 'mediator' from Gabon, a representative of the World Bank and another from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were invited to take part in the peace negotiations between the National Resistance Council (Conseil national de la resistance or CNR) of Ntoumi and the Congolese government. Following the agreement, the US ambassador in Brazzaville proposed his 'assistance' to the military man of God who had now become a politician and apostle of peace. But, above all, this agreement gave its blessing to the military-religious action of the pastor by bringing him onto the national political scene. After twelve years of underground resistance, he was named 'Delegate General in charge of promoting the values of peace and repairing the consequences of war' in December 2009. 
		 This politico-religious conversion reflected the insecurity he fostered as a member of the 'opposition' in Pool, in the Kongo region. It would, of course, be interesting to examine the ethnic cleansing carried out by the pastor in the context of the psychiatric normalization enterprise previously conducted by means of the Gospel, on the one hand, and in the context of the overall policy framework, and the issues relating to Franco-American strategies in the region, on the other. However, as far as we are concerned, let us note especially that this agreement confirmed the political career of Pastor Ntoumi by capitalizing on his ability to deal out death while reducing Africanity to an effective ideology, obscuring its historical link with a certain power. In this case, that power was the 
		 Mundele or Bula Matari system, which was inherited and reconfigured by Mundele Ndombe (the White Negro), under pressure, in all areas, from material dispute and the anti-kinship logic as it affected ethnicity and lineage. Many of our respondents in Brazzaville have argued that Ntoumi was being used by the government and the Congolese army (officers are said to have benefited from the money disbursed by the state to wage war against the warlike pastor). This is likely. However, it does not entirely account for the fact that the ethno-national logic of his mission was belied to a significant extent by his actions and the transformation of the Kongo region of Pool into a military-religious 'camp'. 
		 The 'transnationalism' demanded and staged through a network providing support for the political rise of the pastor contrasted strongly with another form of transnationalism, that of Pastor William Arsene Yaucat Guendi, as evidenced by its place of production: Europe. 
		 WILLIAM YAUCAT GUENDI: 'PROPHET OF THE NATIONS' OR 'MAKWA PROPHET'? 
		 It was in Paris that William, a former activist of the Union of Socialist Youth of the Congolese Labour Party (Parti congolais du travail or PCT), encountered God's divine power. While in Algeria, he was 'guided' towards the Institute of Economics although he preferred computer studies, given the 'plethora in the economic sector in our country', and after three years of study he changed subject. 
		 In Paris, as part of the engineering and programming syllabus, he attended a conference on 'The computerization of the Third World and its consequences'. During the buffet after the conference, he heard 'people singing in the premises next door'. After the praise giving, some words caught his attention: 'The Lord saves, the Lord heals.' Then came the testimony of various people, including a woman cured of a 'generalized cancer' and a twelve-year-old girl, 'originally a dwarf, who has resumed her growth after the "things" that had condemned her had been burned'. William enquired of the head of the religious group: 'Sir, tell me, what is this sect?' 
		 The 'cult' in question was an evangelical congregation called 'Meeting Hope' ('Rencontre Esperance'), which gave him a Bible. William began to read in order, he said, to 'contradict the gentleman'. To do this, he needed to formulate 'as many questions as possible'. However, from this position of 'doubt', he was 'overwhelmed' and began to 'speak strangely', before meeting a man who told him: 'The Lord has said, "Seek and you will find.'" This man gave him the teaching on the Sermon on the Mount, adding: 'Keep carefully what you have just received.' Thus began the Paris-based prophetic-therapeutic vocation of the man who considers himself the 'father of the spiritual revival in Congo Brazzaville', first in white circles (not without competition from the marabouts), and later extending far beyond these. 
		 A few years later he returned to his home country, and, in 1987, he founded his church: the Prophetic and Apostolic Universal Mission of the Cedar, more commonly known as 'the Mission of the Cedar' or 'William'. The church is located in the northern part of the capital; in the politico-ethnic geography of Brazzaville, inherited from the colonial biopolitics of Mundele, the north of the city corresponds to expansions of the originally multi-ethnic district of Poto Poto. Although the establishment of the church in this area has followed a geopolitical or ethno-national spatial logic, the 'Prophet of the Nations' would also, like Pastor Ntoumi, be confronted with the logic of death that is constitutive of colonial and postcolonial power. 
		 For the members of his Makwa ethnic group (based in the north of the country), the arrival of a Makwa prophet essentially indicated the advent of their own God, one that competed with the God of the Bakongo. For William, however, the important point was to define himself as 'Prophet of the Nations'. And in this attempt to define his mission, the 'prophet' went so far as to prophesy against the interests of his brothers in the north, announcing the defeat of their political leader in the presidential elections. On the same day, 13 April 1997, six weeks before the start of the war, the members of his church were savagely beaten in the northern districts of Brazzaville and driven away by the Cobra militia of General Sassou Nguesso (Tonda 1997). 
		 William's prophecy recognized the challenge posed by the 'northern' single party and its leaders, who spoke in religious terms of Satanism and witchcraft. From the perspective of the northern supporters of Sassou Nguesso, this prophecy showed that William was a northern traitor in the service of the ethno-regional cause of southern Kongo. The violence against church members was a harbinger of war in 1997, and took place inside the 'North Camp' (Tonda 1998): it would reveal a major issue, irreducible to the ethnic arguments put forward, when the pillaging of goods punctuated the fighting, regardless of the ethno-regional camps in which this took place. 
		 The material dispute here appears at the heart of a massive production of death. William's religious enterprise nonetheless demonstrated that it was fully included within the economic logic of material dispute, particularly through his aims for 'development', to which the village of Djiri can bear witness. With a population of more than 700 people, this village, which in many respects displays the characteristics of a camp of 'disciplinarisation' (Foucault 1997: 163) by means of economic and religious knowledge, turned the Prophet of the Nations into a powerful economic entrepreneur employing a workforce disciplined by the Pentecostal fervour that he was able to produce, maintain and strengthen by such mechanisms as publicizing his work in the media, including in the church's own newspaper and website. 
		 Here, two dynamic processes of identity are dovetailed. We see the national and transnational ambitions of the leader, on the one hand, and the affirmation of ethnic identity of the faithful, endorsed by the relations between the Prophet of the Nations and the traditionalist Congolese authorities in Kinshasa, on the other. (21) However, when investigating the confusion surrounding border ambitions as opposed to the ethno-prophetic demands of a religious movement, we cannot ignore the Bundu dia Kongo movement in Congo-Kinshasa. 
		 NE MUANDA NSEMI AND THE RESTORATION OF KONGO TERRITORY 
		 Bundu dia Kongo (BDK) (22) claims to be fighting for the rehabilitation of the cultural values of the Kongo ethnic group and for the rebirth of the civilizations that existed in Central Africa before the arrival of Mundele, the White man. As such, it challenges the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), whose borders were established by the Berlin Act. But while the movement has existed since 1986, (23) the 2000s were marked by major clashes between this prophetic movement and the government in Kinshasa. While the religious movement has denounced the massacres orchestrated by the state in the province of Bas-Congo since 2002, the state has accused the BDK of acts of insurrection (including the assassination of officials from state enterprises) and secessionist intentions. 
		 On the BDK website, it says that the founder of the movement was visited by the Spirit of God in 1969, while he was a chemistry student at the University of Lovanium (Kinshasa); the Spirit revealed to him that Simon Kimbangu was unable to complete his mission and his work had been deflected from its path: 'Lead my people to the "Kongo Nzila" because the Kongo tradition is the main axis of the universal religion adapted to the mentality of the African Negro peoples. The Kongo religion will be the soul of the Black African Renaissance.' (24) In line with the classical trajectory of prophetic careers, Muanda Nsemi refused the mission, given his scientific training, saying: 'I've never been interested in religion. I am not qualified to perform such a task.' (25) 
		 Not until seventeen years later did he accept the mission and establish the BDK, whose objective was not only to promote the 'renaissance' of the African people and its values but to restore economic resources to the geographical area of the former Kongo Kingdom. The movement appears both as a 'staging post for integration' of foreigners from countries in the area of the former Kongo Kingdom (including the two Congos and North Angola) and as a 'barrier excluding non-natives of this area' (see Kiangu Sindani 1992: 71-4), namely Whites and ethnic groups that have become 'mixed' with the Bakongo. Following this logic, Kinshasa has been confiscated by the Bangala, originally from Equateur (under the Mobutu regime), and the Baswahili, originally from the east (under Joseph Kabila's regime), while the country's independence is the result of Kongo nationalist federalism and the capital was part of the former Kongo Kingdom. 
		 In the 2000s, a series of clashes and massacres took place in Bas-Congo. The followers of the BDK attacked government representatives, including the non-Kongo leaders of state-run companies. Under the Minister of the Interior, General Denis Kalume, government repression was ruthless. In 2005 alone, there were over one hundred dead, including both followers of the movement and members of the police. The insistence on the way in which Kongo mentality and culture had been literally defiled by the ethnic mix resulting from colonial and precolonial occupation was expressed in the following terms: 
		 sending police, with their genocidal mentality, to a province with a noble mentality, is a disaster for the province, a moral catastrophe for the aboriginal people in the province. From 1965 to date, a centralizing and dictatorial unitarianism has failed. The Territorial Army of Non-natives has spread anti-values banned by the Sacred Law of the Lord Akongo. The time has thus come to draw the lessons from this negative past, and to change course, (quoted in Kiangu Sindani 1992) 
		 In 2006, Muanda Nsemi was elected Member of the National Assembly as an independent candidate for the Luozi region in Bas-Congo. However, this election did not end the fighting. Between June 2006 and February 2007, there was more bloodshed in Bas-Congo as a challenge was mounted to the outcome of the election on behalf of the governor of the region, Mbatshi Mbatsha, a member of the PPRD (Parti du Peuple pour la Reconstruction et la Democratie), the ruling party. He was accused of not being Mukongo; he was in fact from the Mayombe, a region of Bas-Congo. It was claimed that there had been fifty deaths, and there was a renewed outbreak of violence in 2008. Eventually, the movement was banned and urged to become a political party in order to remove any ambiguity--and this finally became a reality with the arrival of the party Bundu Dia Mayala, with Ne Muanda Nsemi as its president. 
		 Since his election to the National Assembly, Ne Muanda Nsemi has denied the charges against the BDK and has denounced the methods of the 'restoration of state authority'. In 2008, those attending a parliamentary session could hear him denying each of the charges laid by the state: these extended from the forms of mediation that had been created by the movement to deal with the failures of a 'corrupt' state, and that were not in any way linked to the 'courts', to the 'alleged' links between the BDK and the Ninjas of Pastor Ntoumi (see above) or the FLEC (the Cabinda independence movement in Angola). For Ne Muanda Nsemi, these accusations of BDK militarization were part of a 'complete putup job by the state' to attract the sympathy of Congo Brazzaville and Angola for the 'massacre of the Bas-Congos'. 
		 In 2009, Lokasola N 'Koy Bosenge noted in an article published on the Societe civile (civil society) website that 'once again, everything now suggests that the powers that be are about to honour for the umpteenth time those who had opted to challenge them by military means'. (26) Observers could draw a comparison with the CNDP (Conseil national pour la defense du peuple) of Laurent Nkunda, (27) who, having waged war in the eastern DRC, was 'rewarded' by ministerial positions in the provincial government. Would this movement today be the subject of such discriminatory treatment if it were once as militarily strong as the CNDP of Laurent Nkunda? The question remains open; however, the dossier was brought up again in connection with the case of Chebeya, a human rights activist whose assassination in June 2010 was linked to 'dossiers' that were compromising for the state and that concerned the massacres of followers of the BDK and the mystical-military rebellion of Enyele, an insurrection that took place in Equateur. These arguments are regularly brandished by the opposition. 
		 However, Ne Muanda Nsemi's career was heading towards an incorporation within the centralizing project of the state; in 2011, he stood under the banner of another party with ethnic rather than religious overtones, 'Congopax', and was elected as member of parliament for the city of Kinshasa. His language now expressed a more conciliatory attitude towards power; this was ideologically consistent with several leaders from Bas-Congo who were calling on people to support the government and break away from a systematic posture of opposition. 
		 CONCLUSION 
		 As characters with multiple or plural vocations, these pastors and prophets embody the deep intricacies of different social fields within postcolonial African societies. The dynamic processes that are intrinsic to them form and inform the relationship between Africanity and religious pluralism within territories 'originally' considered as 'villages or countries of the Whites'--that is, villages or countries of modernity. In this sense, we can say that Mboka Mondele indicates a structural elsewhere from which a set of things can be imagined, conceived or carried out, starting with Africanity in relation to the dynamic processes of national, ethno-national and/or transnational identity produced by these spaces. 
		 Thus, the processes of conflict, competition and alliance at work are expressed through differentiated and strategic uses of the Bible, as a symbol of modernity, and the idiom of witchcraft (and thus of practices and representations of 'occult economies'), as a symbol of Africanity. These practices reflect not only the belief of 'everyone' (both Christians and 'pagans') in the contents of the myths that define them but also the fact that the Bible and witchcraft are being set up as weapons of war against each other. Vested with what is simultaneously a spiritual and a political agency, (28) these 'weapons' exercise their power indiscriminately, without regard for the spatio-temporal variations in the conflict intrinsic to these religious forms. The logics that govern the process whereby misfortune and 'blockages' (regarding individual success, health and national development) in customs, attitudes, kinship or power lead to religious geographies can be heuristically apprehended in the long term (temps long) and through multiple perspectives. This is particularly true when it comes to distinguishing what is a variation of scale as opposed to a difference of logic in the transformation of the mechanisms of deliverance. For throughout the prophetic-Pentecostal market, a notable continuity can be discerned. Just as the misfortunes of the individual are referred to the family economy, those of the nation can be interpreted in accordance with the logic of a 'we' or a collective (family) 'body' subject to 'blockages' or 'external' attacks with 'internal' complicity. The case of Archbishop Kutino shows particularly clearly the logical continuity between a theology of prosperity and an accusation of witchcraft in the guise of ethno-nationalism. The careers of Pastor Ntoumi and Prophet of the Nations William Yaucat Guendi, meanwhile, are examples of religious vocations closely related to the trajectories of political militancy and divine healing, which lead to original entrepreneurships in 'development' and 'political healing' after a period of ethno-national conflict. And the Kongo prophetism that Ne Muanda Nsemi has established against the postcolonial state articulates the idea of economic development through the emergence of an ethno-transnational religion that could revive a precolonial territory. 
		 In different forms, the transition to military action at the behest of, or against, religious movements systematically links ethnicity to material dispute whose variations inform the mythical and contemporary figures of Mundele. Through their involvement in the work of God, mosala ya Nzambe, in Mboka mundele, the men of God confront identity issues and the political, economic and mortuary questions that constitute the institutionalization of religious pluralism in this space. These markets invested by religious leaders--which have their entrepreneurs, their clients, their marketing strategies, their 'places' and 'non-places' (Auge 2008)--are often indistinguishable from the markets of 'occult economies' (Comaroff and Comaroff 2010), thanks to sometimes spectacular conversions in the politico-religious and military-religious fields. The resulting blurring of categories and typologies signals the dovetailing of the registers and temporalities that underlie these religious enterprises and innovations. 
		 The notion of 'necropolitics' (necropolitique) developed by Mbembe (2006) may be related here to the militias of the religious chiefs, those 'war machines' that allow the religious power whose constituency is the ethnic group (ethnie) or the nation to make 'foreignness' (of the Rwandan or any other 'race') a justification for killing. 
		 The blurring that results from this also applies to the empowerment of religious-political schemes, such as the accusation about the origins of the Congolese president, that are largely taken up outside the churches--for instance, within the political movements of the diaspora that are openly 'anti-pastor' (Demart and Bodeux 2013) or those that disqualify Honore Ngbanda because of his Mobutist past, while repeating the central argument about Congolity conveyed by the accusation about the Rwandan origins of the head of state. 
		 Consequently, it is not surprising that the neoliberal era of political pluralism, which in Brazzaville and Kinshasa followed the era of single parties, was marked by the rise of leaders mainly located in the Pentecostal religious market and having a more or less direct connection with the markets of death, whose rhetoric and military expression are currently among the most significant forms. How, then, can we fail to analyse political-religious or even military-religious conversions in terms of the 'capacity for sacralisation of urban space based on the use of ancient and contemporary foundation myths' (Dorier-Apprill 2006)? But above all, in these heterotopias, the reference to Mindele, those 'ghosts', (29) reveals, in the context of endless transition (Mbembe 2001; 2006; Marshall 2009), the potential violence of 'imperial debris' (Stoler 2008), those remnants of the colonial era, the effects of which, in the lives of people or environments (social or religious, for instance), continue to question the strength of the imperial legacy far beyond its fragmentation.

		10.15184/aqy.2015.176 Flaked-tool technology can provide insights into social and cultural changes and interregional connections. This study of changing tool production covers the Upper Palaeolithic to the Late Neolithic in the Yakutia region of eastern Siberia. This region is home to the Palaeolithic Dyuktai complex, the Mesolithic Sumnagin complex and Neolithic traditions; it thus enables a better understanding of the material culture of these societies in Siberia and improves our knowledge of the complex migration processes towards the New World. Keywords: Siberia, Yakutia, Upper Palaeolithic, Late Neolithic, lithic technology

		 Introduction 
		 The prehistory of Beringia offers an intricate array of different cultures and technological traditions that are closely interrelated. Indeed, the peopling of the New World is the result of various migration waves arriving from north-east Asia. From the Palaeolithic to the Late Holocene, Siberian prehistoric societies have played a major role in the large-scale migration processes towards the Americas. Siberian Palaeolithic sites such as Ushki Lake in Kamchatka have been considered as possible ancestors for the Nenana and Clovis complexes (Dikov &amp; Titov 1984), although recent research suggests otherwise (Goebel et al. 2010). The Siberian Palaeolithic sites assigned to the Dyuktai complex are considered to be the Asian equivalent of the Denali complex in Alaska (e.g. Plumet 2004a; Holmes 2008; Gomez Coutouly 2011a, 2012) based on the very similar type of technological implements. The Sumnagin Mesolithic complex of Siberia is also seen by a few researchers as having technologically influenced some of the Early Holocene Northwest Pacific coastal occupations such as Anangula (Kozlowski &amp; Bandi 1984; Slobodin 2011). Finally, it has been argued that the Palaeoeskimo cultures found their roots in the Siberian Neolithic cultures (e.g. Anderson 1980; Dumond 1984a; Powers &amp; Jordan 1990; Plumet 1994, pers. comm.; Tremayne 2011). Hence, better understanding the material culture from Palaeolithic to Neolithic societies in Siberia will definitively improve understanding of the complex migration processes towards the New World.
		Pressure microblades are found in Beringian prehistoric assemblages for tens of thousands of years, from the early Upper Palaeolithic in most of greater Beringia, up to the Late Holocene in some areas such as the interior of Alaska and regions of Siberia (Gomez Coutouly 2011a). Thus, study of pressure-based assemblages is of major importance in understanding more comprehensively the technological and cultural relations between prehistoric groups from the North Pacific. Indeed, the first artefacts used to draw a cultural connection between Asian and American prehistoric sites were pressure-flaked microblade cores (Nelson 1935, 1937). The pressure technique had not yet been formalised at that time and the comparison was made on typological grounds. 
		 Yakutia region: a case study 
		 The archaeological record of Yakutia serves as an excellent case study given that the archaeology of Yakutia has played a major role well beyond its borders, from comparisons to its Siberian neighbouring regions (Kamchatka, Chukotka and so on), to comparisons involving the wider research question of the peopling of the Americas. This region is home to major Siberian prehistoric sites and complexes such as the Dyuktai complex (where this Palaeolithic culture was first defined), the Sumnagin complex (also first defined based on Yakutian assemblages) and some of the Neolithic assemblages discussed as possible ancestors for the Palaeoeskimo. My analysis of Upper Palaeolithic to Neolithic archaeological collections from the Museum of the Centre for the Archaeology and Palaeoecology of Arctic People (Russian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, Yakutsk, Russia) (see online supplementary material for further details), indicates that for more than 10 000 years prehistoric people in the region used pressure-flaking as the primary technique for the production of tools. This technique evolved over time from the production of pressure microblades to that of pressure bladelets, and finally to the production of large pressure blades. Therefore, this is a rare opportunity to look in detail at the evolution of this particular manufacturing technique over a period of thousands of years within a specific region and to examine the broader technological changes in order to draw some large-scale cultural and technological connections. This article will not attempt to characterise the entire lithic industry, nor will it challenge the presently established cultural chronology for the region. While this discussion mainly revolves around the pressure microblade and blade components, other elements of the lithic industry will be discussed when appropriate. The chronology of the prehistoric complexes in Yakutia (the case study region) is as follows (mainly based on Mochanov &amp; Fedoseeva 1986; all dated using the CalPal2007 calibration curve at 68.2% probability): 
		 * Dyuktai complex (Upper Palaeolithic): c. 17 000-13 000 cal BP 
		 * Sumnagin complex (Mesolithic): c. 13 000-7000 cal BP 
		 * Syalakh complex (Early Neolithic): c. 7000-c. 5700 cal BP 
		 * Belkachi complex (Middle Neolithic): c. 5700-c. 4300 cal BP 
		 * Ymyakhtakh complex (Late Neolithic): c. 4300-c. 3300 cal BP 
		 A note on pressure-flaking 
		 Crabtree's experiments on pressure flaking and blade production clearly demonstrated that "the wider the blade, the greater the amount of pressure that is required [to produce it]" (Crabtree 1968: 468). Pelegrin has experimented with several different pressure techniques (termed modes') for the removal of blades and microblades in order to reproduce various archaeological examples that vary widely in size from small microblades to very large blades (Pelegrin 1988, 2003, 2012; Gomez Coutouly 2011a, 2011b). As a result, Pelegrin has proposed five main pressure-flaking modes for the production of microblades and blades (Figure 1): hand-held (mode 1), shoulder crutch (mode 2), short abdominal crutch (mode 3), long crutch (mode 4) and pressure with a lever device (mode 5). In sum, modes 1 and 2 produce microblades; mode 3 produces slightly larger microblades or bladelets; mode 4 produces blades; and mode 5 produces large blades (see online supplementary material Figures S2 &amp; S3). 
		 Key features of pressure flaking include edge regularity and parallelism, a straight rather than curved profile, maximum width at the shoulder (i.e. immediately below the bulb) and the presence of a very small point-like pressure bulb. 
		 The Dyuktai complex (Upper Palaeolithic, c. 17 000-13 000 cal BP): the Yubetsu method and pressure microblades 
		 Mochanov's investigations at Dyuktai Cave led to the definition of the Dyuktai Palaeolithic complex. This is primarily characterised by the presence of wedge-shaped microblade cores that are part of a broader bifacial industry (Mochanov 1980; Mochanov &amp; Fedoseeva 1986). Burins, bifacial projectile points and knives, and expedient flake tools are also common in these assemblages. The artefacts discussed here were recovered from Dyuktai Cave and Verkhne-Troitskaya. 
		 Microblade cores from the Dyuktai complex (Figure 2) are dominated by wedge-shaped forms that are usually prepared according to the Yubetsu method (e.g. Gomez Coutouly 2011a) and virtually all pressure-flaked microblades are made using the hand-held or shoulder-crutch technique (modes 1 and 2) (see online supplementary material for further details). Along with the Yubetsu method, more expedient microblade cores on flakes are also present in various Dyuktai complex assemblages, such as at Ezhantsy or Verkhne-Troitskaya (e.g. Gomez Coutouly 2011a). Although there are some scarce counterexamples (Figure 3d; Gomez Coutouly 201 la), microblades of the Dyuktai complex are almost never retouched or transformed into tools following detachment (Figure 3e--j). Instead, they were used as insets in grooved bone, antler and ivory tools (e.g. projectile points and knives). The associated toolkit also includes bifaces and bifacial points (Figure 3a-b), end scrapers (Figure 3c) and burins (Figure 3k).

		 [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] 
		 [FIGURE 3 OMITTED] 
		 The Sumnagin complex (Mesolithic, c. 13 000-7000 cal BP): the end of the Yubetsu method and the appearance of pressure bladelets 
		 The Sumnagin complex found across Siberia is a terminal Upper Palaeolithic or Mesolithic complex (Mochanov &amp; Fedoseeva 1986; Slobodin 1999; Pitul'ko 2001; Plumet 2004a, 2004b) that was originally defined based on assemblages from the region of Yakutia (Mochanov 1977). The toolkit includes conical microblade cores, multifaceted burins, end scrapers, large bifacial adzes and other lithic tool types. Apart from the large bifacial adzes, no bifacial tools are associated with this complex. Some of the new tool forms that appear during this time period are also present in the subsequent Neolithic complexes (Pitul'ko 2001; Dyakonov 2007). The Mesolithic artefacts discussed here were all recovered from the Ust-Timpton I site. 
		 Microblade cores of the Siberian Mesolithic are no longer wedge-shaped as were those of the Dyuktai complex. Instead, they are almost exclusively conical or tabular in shape (Figure 4). This is not only a morphological variation, but also a radical technological shift that has direct implications for the core-holding device (clamp vs grooved system) (see online supplementary material for further details). 
		 Along with this change in morphology, and thus in the core-holding system, appear slightly larger microblades (or small blades), corresponding to pressure-flaking modes 2 and 3 (Figure 5b-h). Indeed, mode 3 seems to be widespread for the production of larger microblades (or bladelets) during this time. The mean width of microblades from the Sumnagin complex at the Ust-Timpton I site suggests a combination of mode 1 or 2, with mode 3 pressure-flaking (supplementary Figure S3). These three changes (core morphology, core-holding device and pressure-flaking modes) should be considered as parts of a fundamental change in microblade technology, and not as separate inventions. 
		 The microblades produced by Mesolithic cores were either used unretouched, or were subsequently transformed into formal tools. Microblades that lack intentional retouch (Figure 5a-d &amp; f-h) were probably intended for use as insets in grooved bone, antler or ivory tools (e.g. projectile points and knives), as was the case in the Palaeolithic. Good examples outside Yakutia are furnished by the Siberian Mesolithic site on Zhokov Island (New Siberian Islands), where various organic tools with microblade insets have been preserved in permafrost (Pitul'ko 1993, 1998; Pitul'ko &amp; Kasparov 1996). But microblades were also regularly transformed into various types of tools, such as burins, end scrapers, drills and points (Dyakonov 2007; Figure 5e &amp; i-k), which is one of the main differences when compared with microblades from the Palaeolithic period. One artefact, a blade blank with a partial retouch along the edges in order to create a small bifacial tip (Figure 51), suggests the possibility of pressure-blade production mode 4 during the Mesolithic. As shown here, this type of tool is also characteristic of the subsequent Neolithic periods when pressure blades are common. Therefore, a Mesolithic date for this particular tool may be questionable. Multifaceted burins (Figure 5m), typical of subsequent Siberian Neolithic cultures, also make their appearance during the Sumnagin complex.

		 [FIGURE 5 OMITTED] 
		 Siberian Neolithic cultures: the spread of pressure blades 
		 It is important to clarify that the term 'Neolithic' does not have the same meaning in Siberia as it does in Europe. In Siberia, the appearance of pottery (supplementary Figure S4) is not associated with the establishment of sedentary settlements as it is in the European Neolithic. So far, studies concerning ceramics in Siberia have mainly focused on styles, chronology and geographic distribution, and "it must be recognized that very little is known currently about the reasons why pottery was adopted in the region and for what purposes it was used" (McKenzie 2009: 197). Some authors notice, however, that the appearance of ceramics coincides with an intensification of an economy based on fishing, a pattern that can be generalised not only to Yakutia and Siberia, but to the whole of the Eurasian continent: "it is possible to make a broad and overreaching generalization that much of the pottery use [by foragers across Eurasia] occurred in fishing contexts" (Barnett 2009: 556). Siberian Neolithic cultures (Mochanov 1969; Chard 1974; Mochanov &amp; Fedoseeva 1986; Pitul'ko 2001; Hoffecker 2005) were mobile groups with an economy based on hunting reindeer and moose, as well as exploiting river and lake resources. The subsistence economy does not vary significantly during the three stages of the Siberian Neolithic. The most distinctive feature of Siberian Neolithic tool industries is the appearance of polished tools (supplementary Figure S5), but also the widespread use of pressure-blade production mode 4. Evidence of this technique is clearly visible on both cores and blades from these assemblages. Along with blades, microblade cores (mode 2 and 3) are still found in Neolithic assemblages. Use of the mode 4 technique during the Siberian Neolithic was determined from the regularity of blade and blade scar lengths and widths in the assemblages. The artefacts ascribed to the Syalakh, Belkachi and Ymyakhtakh complexes are primarily from the sites of Belkachi I, Sumnagin I, Ust-Timpton I, Tommot I and Onn'yosskogo. 
		 1. The Syalakh complex (Early Neolithic, c. 7000-5000 cal BP): the appearance of pressure-flaking with a lever device 
		 The Syalakh complex shows strong continuity with the Sumnagin Mesolithic complex in several respects and is marked by the introduction of pottery and the presence of bone harpoons. The lithic industry consists mainly of blade products (Dyakonov 2007), adzes, partly polished points and bifacial arrowheads. Small blade (Figure 6a--b) and microblade cores persist throughout the Neolithic, but large, pressure-flaked blades and blade cores first appear during the Early Neolithic. In most cases, these cores are pressure-flaked using the mode 4 technique (Figure 6c), but there is at least one example of mode 5 technique (Figure 7) (see online supplementary material for further details). Production of very large blades using this technique is known in other parts of the world during the Neolithic (e.g. Manolakakis 1996; Perils 2004), but this is the first recognition of this technique in a Siberian context. Furthermore, given the nomadic nature of Siberian Neolithic populations, this is rare evidence of pressure-flaking using a lever within nomadic populations. Pressure-flaked microblades and blades are left unretouched (Figure 8b--g), probably to be used as insets, such as those of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic. Some of the blades, however, are further modified into tools, as with the typical blades with bifacially flaked tips (Figure 8h-j). Multifaceted burins (Figure 8k-l) and bifacial points (Figure 8m-n) are also part of the tool-kit. The retouch on the bifacial points is also made by pressure-flaking. 
		 [FIGURE 6 OMITTED] 
		 [FIGURE 7 OMITTED] 
		 2. The Belkachi complex (Middle Neolithic, c. 5700-4300 cal BP): the persistence of pressure-flaked microblades and blades 
		 The lithic industry of the following period, the Belkachi complex, is characterised by tools made from microblades and blades, multifaceted burins, axes, projectiles and drills. No evidence of mode 5 pressure-flaking with a lever device has been identified, but blade cores (mode 4) are clearly represented (Figure 9a-b) (see online supplementary material for further details). Small blade cores and microblade cores (Figure 9c-e) are still present and, in morphological and technological terms, have not evolved much since the Mesolithic Sumnagin complex. Blade and microblades are unretouched (Figure 10a-e), intentionally retouched or transformed into tools (Figure 10f-g). A number of grooved points of bone and antler have blade insets still attached to them (Figure 10j). Multifaceted burins persist and it is interesting to note that some are made on exhausted pressure-flaked microblade cores (Figure 10h-i). 
		 3. The Ymyakhtakh complex (Late Neolithic, c. 4300-3300 cal BP): pressure-flaked microblades and blades and little evidence for the presence of pressure with a lever 
		 Late Neolithic communities in Yakutia were more mobile than those of earlier Neolithic periods, but the Ymyakhtakh complex is characterised, as before, by blade production. Small blades and small microblades persist (Figure 11a-c), as well as large, pressure-flaked blades (Figure lid). There is no direct evidence for the use of pressure-flaking with a lever device. Some tenuous evidence could indicate the presence of this technique, but it is far from demonstrated (see online supplementary material for further details). Multifaceted burins (Figure 12a-b) and various sorts of bifacial points and tools (Figure 12c-f) remain a feature of these assemblages. New types of tools were also introduced, such as the standardised rectangular insets with bifacial pressure-flaked retouch (Figure 12g-k) mentioned above.

		 In Yakutia, the emergence of the Sumnagin Mesolithic complex at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition coincides with the appearance of conical microblade cores and the virtual disappearance of wedge-shaped cores produced by the Yubetsu method during the Palaeolithic, an evolution seemingly occurring throughout Siberia as well. Even in the absence of radiocarbon dates, stratigraphic context or other diagnostic artefacts, the presence of conical cores strongly suggests a Mesolithic or Neolithic occupation. Similarly, with very few, if any, exceptions, the presence of wedge-shaped Yubetsu-style cores is evidence for Upper Palaeolithic occupation. The transition from wedge-shaped to conical cores between the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic may have been a gradual process, but there is a clear technological and functional continuity in the pressure-blade assemblages. Unretouched microblades were still used as insets in grooved antler pieces such as projectile points and knives during the Mesolithic. There were also several important changes between the Palaeolithic Dyuktai complex and the Mesolithic Sumnagin complex. Microblades were retouched into formal tools such as burins, truncated blades, gravers, borers and projectile points; multifaceted burins and large bifacial adzes were produced; and bifaces and bifacial projectile points disappeared (Powers 1973; Mochanov &amp; Fedoseeva 1986; Dyakonov 2007; Gomez Coutouly 2011a). The next major transition, from the Mesolithic to Neolithic, is also marked by continuity and innovation. The Neolithic Syalakh complex represents a major cultural change, with the appearance of pressure-flaked blades, the introduction of ceramics, new tool types including polished stone tools, the first signs of social stratification during the Neolithic and an economy based on hunting reindeer and moose. In flaked stone technology, the introduction of mode 3 pressure-flaking using a lever device is especially significant and further research should seek to determine whether blades obtained by this technique were intended for a specific purpose and were in use during the whole of the Neolithic or only during its first stage (the Syalakh complex). The identification of this apparently rare manufacturing technique in a Siberian context has significant implications for our understanding of social and economic changes during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. In Europe, pressure blades are often interpreted as a prestige item associated with higher social status. It is possible that a similar scenario was unfolding in Siberia. 
		 The prehistoric migration waves towards the New World 
		 One of the first migration waves from Siberia to Alaska that is easily recognisable concerns the diffusion of pressure-flaked microblades that spread during the Pleistocene--Holocene transition. The most ancient known human occupation in Alaska so far, Swan Point CZ4 (c. 14 000 cal BP), is the only one in this region to have unearthed a whole microblade toolkit made of Yubetsu microcores and therefore has clear technological ties with the Dyuktai complex of Siberia (Holmes 2008, 2011; Gomez Coutouly 201 la). Afterwards, in Alaska, the Yubetsu method was rapidly abandoned and replaced by the Campus method (Holmes 2008; Gomez Coutouly 2011a, 2012) and other conical and tabular microcores. As for the Palaeolithic of Siberia, most pressure-flaked microblades in Alaska were also made using the hand-held or shoulder-crutch technique, although there can be some exceptions (Gomez Coutouly 2011a). 
		 The clear division between microcore morphology in Palaeolithic assemblages and that in later Mesolithic and Neolithic assemblages in Siberia does not carry over to the archaeological record of eastern Beringia. Microcore forms recovered from Alaskan assemblages of Holocene date tend to be more conical or tabular (Holmes et al. 1996: figs 6-9), but wedge-shaped microcores are found throughout the Holocene (Broken Mammoth, Swan Point and so on). It has been proposed that the Sumnagin complex gave rise to some of the coastal sites from the Pacific Northwest area (Ackerman 1992, 2008; Dumond &amp; Bland 1995; Slobodin 2011). There are some technological parallels between the Sumnagin complex and such Early Holocene sites as Anangula in the Aleutian Islands. But there are still some differences in how these microblade cores were prepared. Among them, Sumnagin cores have removals all around the circumference of the core--which is rarely the case in the Anangula assemblage (Gomez Coutouly 2015)--and are used to pressure-flake bladelets, in contrast to most coastal sites from Alaska and British Columbia, where only small microblades are being produced (Gomez Coutouly 2011a). Of course, the differences are not only seen in the pressure microblade component, but also in other aspects of the stone tool industry (Gomez Coutouly 2011a, 2015). The influence of the Siberian Mesolithic is not only perceived in Early Holocene sites of the Pacific coast, as it has also been proposed that the presence of conical microblade cores, along with wedge-shaped ones in interior Alaska during the early to mid Holocene, could have been the result of a Sumnagin technological influence (West et al. 1996; Slobodin 2011; Gomez Coutouly 2013). 
		 Whether the Sumnagin complex influenced the Early Holocene archaeological record of Alaska's interior and its coastal regions is still to be demonstrated. Some researchers, however, consider that the Palaeoeskimo cultures that colonised the Arctic region during the Middle to Late Holocene have their roots in Siberia, maybe as early as the Mesolithic (Powers &amp; Jordan 1990; Plumet 1994) or, at the very least, during the Neolithic. The Denbigh Flint Complex in Alaska, the first manifestation of the Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt), marks the onset of the Palaeoeskimo cultures (e.g. Irving 1957; Plumet 1994). This complex, dating to c. 4000 cal BP (Slaughter 2005), has a pressure microblade component (Desrosiers &amp; Sorensen 2012), as do the earlier Pleistocene and Holocene complexes of Alaska (such as the Denali complex) (Gomez Coutouly 2011a). And yet most researchers believe that the origin of the Palaeoeskimo is not to be found in these earlier Alaskan complexes, but rather in the Neolithic cultures of Siberia, and more specifically in the Syalakh, Belkachi and Ymyakhtakh complexes of Yakutia (e.g. Mochanov 1969; Anderson 1980; Dumond 1984a; Powers &amp; Jordan 1990; Plumet 1994, pers. comm.; Odess 2005; Tremayne 2011). This hypothesis is based on various close technological features, including the presence of similar types of ceramics (cord-wrapped), the fact that they are both interior-adapted populations with a subsistence economy relying on caribou hunting, as well as some similar stone artefacts (e.g. Anderson 1980; Plumet 1994). With regard to stone tool technology, Anderson (1980) and Plumet (1994) highlight the following resemblances: bifacially shaped burins, triangular end scrapers with bifacially retouched halting ends, polished blades and small bifacial points, among other traits. 
		 When comparing the Siberian Neolithic artefacts (Mochanov 1969; Mochanov &amp; Fedoseeva 1986) to the Denbigh Flint Complex artefacts (Giddings 1951, 1964; Bandi 1965; Anderson 1984, 1988; Dumond 1984b; Giddings &amp; Anderson 1986; Kunz 2005; Tremayne 2010, 2011; National Park Service n.d.), there are some parallels in the stone tool technology, but also some important differences. There are some small bifacial points from the Neolithic cultures (e.g. Figure 12c-e) that are similar, on typological grounds, to early Palaeoeskimo tools (c.f. Giddings 1964; Anderson 1984; Dumond 1984a). Some larger bifacial points are also very similar in shape, size and in the diagonal pressure retouch (cf. Figure 8m-n; Giddings 1964: fig. 56c). The importance of microblades being transformed into tools (retouched, burins, end scrapers and so on) is also a typical aspect of the Denbigh Flint Complex (Giddings 1964). The similarities in burin technology are, however, still to be demonstrated. Although there are various types of burins within the Denbigh Flint Complex (Giddings 1951, 1964; Kunz 2005; Tremayne 2010, 2011; National Park Service n.d.), they are largely made on bifacial or unifacial blanks. On the contrary, the Mesolithic and Neolithic burins from Yakutia are mainly made on exhausted microblade cores (Figures 5m; 8k--1; 10h-i; &amp; 12a), although similar bifacially flaked burins do occur. Furthermore, various tool types of the Siberian Neolithic seem to be missing from Denbigh assemblages (such as the blades with a bifacial tip or the bifacially retouched rectangular insets). But the most obvious differences in the respective lithic toolkits can be seen in the complete absence of large, pressure-flaked blade production in Alaskan assemblages. Even if it is not the main type of production, blades and large blades are undeniably a distinctive characteristic of the Yakutian (and Siberian) Neolithic cultures. Indeed, pressure-flaked microblades have been produced in Alaska during the entire fiolocene, but there is yet to be found an assemblage comprising large blades made with pressure techniques. The only core with small, pressure-flaked blades from Alaska is an obsidian core from Nogahabara I (Odess &amp; Rasic 2007), an Early Holocene site. Moreover, Palaeoeskimo cultures that produce pressure-flaked microblades seem to be small, hand-held microblades, rather than the larger, pressure-flaked bladelets that are sometimes present in the Siberian Mesolithic and Neolithic assemblages. 
		 The reasons for all of these differences between Siberian Neolithic and Alaskan ASTt assemblages may be multiple and diverse (group mobility, activities, raw material available and so on), and do not necessarily imply the absence of cultural connections. Nonetheless, if the Siberian Neolithic and the early Palaeoeskimo cultures are affiliated, these differences in stone tool assemblage composition will also have to be taken into account and explained. 
		 Conclusion 
		 The production of pressure-flaked blades within Siberia and the spread of the technique to other regions of north-east Asia and North America provide a major insight into broad cultural interactions, but also address specific and tangible aspects of these prehistoric populations. Through the analysis of the prehistoric stone tool artefacts from Yakutia and Siberia (their tool types, their evolution and their major technological shifts), we are truly able to glimpse the migration processes that have shaped the history of Beringia and the Arctic from the Late Pleistocene up to the Late Holocene. It is to be expected that the material presented in this article will also be used for comparison by the many specialists from Siberia, Alaska and the Arctic. This should lead to a better comprehension of the cultural and technical processes at stake, thereby enabling new technological (and hence cultural) correlations to be drawn.

<titre>For Sephora, the store is core to its beauty</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW</auteur>
<texte>
		It's lunchtime in <mention id="1856">La Défense business district in Paris</mention> and <meronyme id="1857">the Sephora store</meronyme> is full of shoppers browsing through its high-end make-up and beauty collections.  
		 One young woman is testing out lipstick colours on a virtual mirror; another completes a touchscreen questionnaire to find the perfume that best reflects her desires. She plumps for a bottle of Dior's J'Adore and takes it to the personalisation counter for engraving.
		Like its stores in New York's Times Square and Dubai Mall in the Middle East, Sephora in <mention id="1858">La Défense</mention> has recently reopened after an extensive refurbishment. The investment reflects how bricks and mortar and experiential retail are key to Sephora's growth. The LVMH-owned group, which stocks about 300 brands alongside its own label, has increased sales fourfold in the past eight years, fuelled by a booming beauty market. 
		 "A lot of people are scared of the retail apocalypse so they're not investing in stores, and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," said chief executive Chris de Lapuente in an interview on the shop floor. "We're investing in our stores, taking our top 100 stores in the world and renovating them to the best possible standard."  
		 The global cosmetics market was worth $532bn in 2017 and is expected to grow more than 7 per cent a year to $806bn by 2023, according to Orbis Research.  
		 LVMH on Wednesday said that like-for-like sales at the selective retailing division that Sephora is part of rose 8 per cent to€7.1bn in the first six months of the year. Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimates that the beauty group accounts for about 60 per cent of the unit's sales, and has a profit margin of 12-13 per cent. Sephora is LVMH's second-largest brand by sales. 
		 Mr de Lapuente says one attraction of Sephora is that consumers "discover brands they can't find anywhere else", noting that about a third of its offerings are exclusive to Sephora, and it acts as an incubator for upcoming or niche brands.  
		 Exclusivity might be with Huda, which began selling false eyelashes in Dubai and subsequently developed a collaboration with Sephora; pop star Rihanna's cosmetics brand Fenty, which is on track for€500m sales this year; or an exclusive collaboration with Dior for the Dior Backstage range of make-up.  
		 Pointing to the beauty bar where customers can get a free makeover, Mr de Lapuente added: "Experiential retail is crucial to our success. Sephora is a place where people come for advice, they come to listen. We teach, inspire and play . . . You're not going to get this online. Online you can do your research . . . here you can come and experiment."  
		 Mr Fujimori agrees, saying Sephora "successfully combines experiential retail with a leading ecommerce presence, leveraging digital technology to enhance the shopping experience in-store and online". 
		 The challenge now for Sephora is to stay ahead in a world where there are more make-up and beauty brands than ever, and social media has lowered barriers to entry and boosted the speed to market. Meanwhile, Amazon last month announced the launch of its professional beauty stores, aimed at the mass market. 
		 "Amazon is just another one of the many choices out there," said Mr de Lapuente. "They have a strong e-commerce offering. They don't have stores. We love that consumers love to shop online and in store." He says that customers who buy both on- and offline tend to purchase three times more than those who buy using just one channel. Ecommerce represents an average of 20 per cent of sales in each country for Sephora, which uses influencers to build its community. "Amazon just forces us to raise our game."  
		 Mr de Lapuente, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, joined Sephora as CEO in 2011. It has since launched in 14 new markets, including Mexico, Brazil and Malaysia and now has 2,600 stores in 35 countries, opening stores at a rate of up to 150 a year.  
		 The priority, however, is Asia - "a fantastic opportunity" according to Mr de Lapuente - where sales are growing 20 per cent a year, and 30 per cent in China. Asia's younger consumers, its growing middle class and a high interest in prestige beauty are attractive, and this year Sephora will open stores in Hong Kong and South Korea. The region accounts for roughly 15 per cent of overall sales. 
		 Despite Sephora's increasingly international footprint, it is small or absent in some key markets. It re-entered Germany in 2017, and has no presence in the UK - having pulled out a few years ago - or Japan. "They're opportunities for one day," said Mr de Lapuente. 
		 The pressure is on to keep on innovating. "Beauty is so fast-moving, you can't cruise," said Mr de Lapuente. He says innovation will come both from new products (citing untapped potential in haircare and wellness), and from the way in which brands reach consumers. He sees opportunities in areas like voice-activated ordering through home assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, and social commerce through platforms like China's WeChat.  
		 But despite such technological developments, for Mr de Lapuente, the store has a robust future.  
		 At <mention id="1859">La Défense</mention>, customers are returning to work with Sephora's distinctive striped bags modelled on the black and white stripes of Italy's Siena Cathedral. "Is physical retail alive or dead?" mused Mr de Lapuente among the throng of shoppers. "It looks pretty alive to me. The store is where the magic happens."

<titre>Paris wields carrots and sticks in pitch as EU financial centre</titre>
<auteur>PATRICK JENKINS</auteur>
<texte>
		Milan's pitch to City of London institutions last week would have been comic if it wasn't so tragic. Bizarrely, the lobbying arm of Italy's financial centre chose to arrive for a charm offensive only days after the country's referendum on controversial constitutional reforms, which prime minister Matteo Renzi lost, plunging Italian politics - and its financial sector - into mayhem. 
		 If ever there was a chance of a big finance group shifting operations to Italy, now was not the time to press the case. 
		Other eurozone rivals, by contrast, have been upping their game. Paris, in particular, appears to have enjoyed a surge of interest. In recent weeks, several asset managers have said privately that they might well choose Paris over rival centres such as Dublin, Luxembourg and Frankfurt if Brexit ends up being "hard" and necessitates the establishment of a new EU hub.  
		 That is a U-turn from even a few months ago, when City financiers were as dismissive of Paris's merits as they were of the tortured advertising slogan for <mention id="1860">its La Défense business district</mention> ("Tired of the fog? Try the Frogs! Choose <mention id="1861">Paris La Défense</mention>"). 
		 So what is new? The political sea change has been the most obvious factor. Ever since François Fillon triumphed last month to become the centre-right candidate for May's presidential election, the man who served as prime 
		 minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy from 2007 to 2012 has been feted as France's likely next president (assuming he is not toppled by National Front candidate Marine Le Pen). 
		 The current president, Socialist François Hollande, is not only disliked at home (his approval rating is just 4 per cent) but has long been regarded with suspicion in the City. His threat of a 75 per cent wealth tax, though never implemented, was enough to repel high-earning individuals and employers alike. Mr Fillon would be a breath of fresh air for business, with promises to raise working-hour limits and grant companies €40bn of tax breaks. 
		 At the same time, the Paris financial centre lobby has moved on from weather-based jibes. Already there are attractive personal tax breaks for returning French nationals and foreign labour - with up to half of pay exempt from income tax for five years. The current government is offering to extend that to eight years and make "inpatriation bonuses" tax-free - benefits that financiers believe a Fillon government would preserve and maybe even further enhance. 
		 Alongside the big carrots is a fairly sizeable stick - particularly for those asset managers who are professing a sudden fondness for all things French. The Paris lobby's pitch book contains an ominous page warning that UK-based asset managers who think their European business model is "Brexit-proof" may well be mistaken.  
		 The two main EU directives (Ucits and AIFMD) currently used by asset managers to sell cross-border allow funds to be administered from locations such as Dublin, Luxembourg and Paris, but with fund managers in London under so-called "delegation" rules. The pitch book warns that "the current permissive structure for EU funds may not last". The likely greater use of delegation rules by UK funds post-Brexit "may become a great concern for European regulators", such as (Paris-based) securities watchdog Esma. 
		 No wonder there is chatter that the likes of Fidelity are considering shifting large chunks of their workforce to another EU financial centre such as Paris. France's Amundi, Europe's biggest listed fund manager, is doing its bit for the cause. It now has€1.3tn of assets under management, making it the world's number eight, after striking a deal on Monday to acquire Italy's Pioneer for€3.5bn. 
		 Most bankers are probably less enamoured of Paris. HSBC may be the exception. It warned in February that in the event of Brexit it could move 1,000 staff from London to the French capital, where it owns CCF. Now the drip-drip seems to have begun. The group has not announced any mass migration, and will hold off from anything dramatic, at least until Brexit negotiations progress. But insiders report that certain investment banking roles, particularly those held by French nationals, have begun to move from London to Paris.  
		 The draw for HSBC is not just the natural efficiency of having a ready-made subsidiary operation in the city. If the rumour mill is right, Henri de Castries - current board member and one-time favourite to succeed Douglas Flint as chairman - will soon be France's finance minister.

<titre>EXCLUSIVE-Suspects had planned attack on <mention id="1863">Paris business district - sources</mention></titre>

<texte>
		(Updates with details, more sources, quote form Interior minister) 
		 By Emmanuel Jarry 
		 PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants flushed out of a Paris suburb by police in a shootout on Wednesday were planning to attack <mention id="1864">the French capital's La Defense business district</mention>, three sources told Reuters. 
		 A source close to the investigation source said the attack was being prepared for Thursday in <mention id="1865">the district that is home to some of France's biggest companies such as the oil major Total and the main trading room of Societe Generale bank</mention>.
		Several police sources said the targets were <meronyme id="1866">the Quatre Temps shopping centre</meronyme> and the main square of <mention id="1867">the district of high-rise office buildings on the western edge of Paris</mention>. 
		 "The police forces were looking for terrorists who were preparing another attack on the basis of information from the (local) counter-terrorism services and overseas," said the source close to the investigation. 
		 "This new team was planning an attack on <mention id="1868">La Defense</mention>," the source said. 
		 A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and another militant died when police raided the apartment in the St. Denis suburb as part of the investigation into last week's coordinated bombings and shootings. 
		 Officials said police had been hunting Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian Islamist militant of Moroccan origin accused of ordering the Nov. 13 attack. More than eight hours after the launch of the pre-dawn raid it was still unclear if they had found him, but they had found something else. 
		 "They were expecting to find Abdelhamid Abaaoud but they came across another thing - a team that was preparing to attack <mention id="1869">La Defense</mention>." 
		 The French interior ministry declined to confirm or deny the information, but later, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve appeared to hint at an extra attack plan. 
		 "These operations were led against people who might have struck again, and once again we see that crimes, murders and barbarity have been avoided." 
		 Seven people were arrested in the operation, including three people who were pulled from the apartment, officials said. 
		 "It is impossible to tell you who was arrested. We are in the process of verifying that. Everything will be done to determine who is who," Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said at the end of the operation. 
		 The police sources indicated that Paris had received a tip about the planned <mention id="1870">La Defense</mention> attack from Morocco's intelligence service and four of its officers were in the French capital to meet police here.

<titre>Burundi: Ban calls parties to refrain from violence during presidential election.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jul 21, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- In a "worrisome context", and following the decision of the government of Burundi to hold the presidential election on 21 July, the United Nations chief called yesterday on the authorities to do all in their power to ensure security and a peaceful atmosphere during the polls. 
		 "Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon further calls on all parties to refrain from any acts of violence that could compromise the stability of Burundi and the region," reads the statement issued by the UN Spokesperson.
		Mr. Ban reiterates his appeal for the resumption of a frank dialogue and urges parties to avoid undermining the progress achieved in "building democracy" since the signing of the Arusha Agreements, adds the statement. 
		 The inter-Burundian dialogue that started on 14 July 2015 under the facilitation of Uganda has been indefinitely suspended. 
		 "The Secretary-General notes that the suspension of the dialogue took place without agreement being reached on a range of issues that would have contributed to the creation of a climate conducive to the holding of credible and peaceful elections, as contained in the relevant recommendations of the East African Community (EAC) and the African Union." 
		 Recalling that the United Nations Electoral Observation Mission has deployed observers countrywide, the UN Chief calls on all parties to facilitate their work and, "in particular," on the government to ensure their security. 
		 According to the UN, civil unrest erupted on 26 April in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, after the ruling Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD) party elected President Pierre Nkurunziza on 25 April as its candidate for the then-scheduled 26 June presidential election. It was postponed to July 15, then July 21.

<titre>UN human rights office warns Burundi crisis 'spiralling out of control'.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Aug 14, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The situation in Burundi continues to deteriorate amid ongoing killings, arrests and detentions in the latest post-election turmoil to afflict the country, the United Nations human rights office has reported. 
		 "We urge all sides to resume dialogue before the situation spirals completely out of control," warned Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as she addressed reporters today in Geneva.
		"Burundi has been slipping closer to the edge with every high-profile attack and killing, and we call on leaders on all sides to take concrete steps to renounce the use of violence and to resolve differences peacefully," she continued. "Where violations and abuses have occurred, there need to be prompt investigations with a view to bringing the perpetrators to account and justice for victims." 
		 According to the UN, civil unrest erupted on 26 April in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, after the ruling Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD) party elected President Pierre Nkurunziza on 25 April as its candidate for the then-scheduled 26 June presidential election. 
		 Mr. Nkurunziza has been in office for two terms since 2005, and a broad array of actors warned that an attempt to seek a third term was unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of the 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi that ended a decade of civil war in the country. 
		 The OHCHR spokesperson observed that since the outbreak of violence in April, at least 96 people have been killed, mostly among opposition supporters, while some 600 people have been arrested and detained. Among those detained, there have been at least 60 cases of torture and many more cases of ill-treatment, she added. 
		 "So far, no trials have taken place in relation to the violence, killings, torture and ill-treatment since April, although the authorities have repeatedly indicated that investigations are under way and that some police elements have been arrested," Ms. Shamdasani said, noting that the actual numbers of persons killed, detained or tortured may be much higher than initially thought. 
		 "We understand that in very few cases have investigations actually been initiated. Continuing impunity in Burundi can only fuel cycles of violence." 
		 Along with the increasing human rights violations, the mounting violence across Burundi has also provoked a widespread humanitarian crisis as refugees have spilled across the country's borders and fanned throughout the region. 
		 Indeed, the most recent data state that over 200,000 people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries with 85,200 Burundian refugees in Tanzania, 71,600 in Rwanda, 28,300 in Uganda, 14,322 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 7,000 in Kenya, and 3,000 in southern Africa.

<titre>A week from presidential polls, Burundi on 'brink of devastating violence' Security Council told.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jul 10, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Two weeks after the contested legislative and communal elections that took place in Burundi and with presidential polls just days away, senior United Nations officials warned the Security Council today that situation prevailing in the Central African country is once again at risk of sliding into violence. 
		 "Burundi is on the brink again [and] the grave danger the country faces should not be underestimated, given the increasing polarization and the apparent choice of Burundian leaders to put personal interest before those of the country," declared UN Assistant-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Taye-Brook Zerihoun.
		"An escalating pattern of politically motivaPeaceful protests have been met with unwarranted use of force, including lethal force, in violation of Burundi's obligation under national and international law to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly. Demonstrators have been imprisoned and subjected to torture and ill-treatment.ted violence, coupled with this country's history of recurring bloodshed and atrocities, should alert us to the potential for serious crisis," underlined UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. 
		 Both officials echoed similar concern as they briefed the Security Council on the situation in Burundi; Mr. Zehiroun on the electoral process and the political and security situations through the work of the UN Election Observation Mission (MENUB) and Mr. Zeid on the protection and promotion of human rights. 
		 "On 2 July, MENUB assessed that the legislative and communal electoral process of June 29 took place against the background of a political crisis, and in a climate of widespread fear and intimidation in parts of the country," said the Assistant Secretary-General. 
		 Some opposition political parties and civil society organizations, notably those opposed to a third term for President Pierre Nkurunziza, called the elections a "sham" and declared they would not recognize the results. 
		 Participants at the Security Council meeting on the situation in Burundi. UN Photo/Loey Felipe/Evan Schneider   
		 Fundamental freedoms of participation, assembly, expression, opinion and information suffered increasing restrictions during the campaign period and as Election Day drew nearer, according to the MENUB observers deployed in all 18 provinces of Burundi. 
		 In the past six months, went on to say Mr. Zeid, members of opposition parties, civil society activists and media figures have been targeted for intimidation, severe harassment and arbitrary detention. 
		 "Peaceful protests have been met with unwarranted use of force, including lethal force, in violation of Burundi's obligation under national and international law to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly. Demonstrators have been imprisoned and subjected to torture and ill-treatment. We have also received reports of extrajudicial killings. To date these violations have not been investigated, prosecuted or sanctioned." 
		 While MENUB assessed that the Independent National Election Commission adequately handled the voter registration and the nomination of candidates, opposition parties repeatedly accused the electoral management body of "lacking credibility and independence," continued Mr. Zehiroun. 
		 Preparations and arrangements for Election Day were largely sufficient, and instances of violence and explosions preceded, and in some cases took place alongside Election Day activities, mostly in Bujumbura, he pointed out. 
		 "In view of its findings, MENUB concluded that the environment was not conducive for free, credible and inclusive elections. The African Union, the Eastern African Community, and the International Conference on Great Lakes Region expressed similar concerns." 
		 According to the Election Commission, the preliminary results of the legislative elections show that Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD), the party received 60.2 per cent of the votes, a result rejected by the opposition, Mr. Zehiroun said. 
		 "Preparations for the presidential election are ongoing. Ballot papers have been printed with all the eight candidates approved by the Election Commission including those who have announced they would boycott the elections," he stressed, adding that the political and security situations in Burundi have remained tense and volatile since the polls. 
		 "The crisis arising from President Nkurunziza's decision to run for a third term in office has undermined a decade of steady progress in building democratic institutions, and precious gains in the sense of a common national community," warned UN rights chief Zeid, stressing that more than 145,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries, and convinced that Burundi is on the brink of "devastating violence" again. 
		 Contrary to some recent reports, the massive outflows of refuges appear to have been sparked, not by rumour, but by precise and targeted campaigns of intimidation and terror. Refugees interviewed by his Office in the Democratic republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Tanzania continue to refer to the Imbonerakure militia as the main threat, but some have also stated that militants from other groups are also employing violence - a new and disturbing development. 
		 During an emergency summit on 6 July, the Assistant Secretary-General added, the East African Community (EAC) issued a Communique, in which were made a number of recommendations, including the postponement of the presidential elections to July 30th 2015; the formation of a government of national unity involving both who participated in the elections and those that did not; and the deployment of an EAC electoral mission to observe the presidential elections. 
		 For Mr. Zehiroun, that Communique is a "clear path forward". 
		 According to the UN, civil unrest erupted on 26 April in Bujumbura after the ruling CNDD-FDD party elected President Pierre Nkurunziza on 25 April as its candidate for then-scheduled 26 June presidential election. Mr. Nkurunziza has been in office for two terms since 2005, and a broad array of actors warned that an attempt to seek a third term was unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of the 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi that ended a decade of civil war in the country.

<titre>Burundi: UN experts urge Security Council action amid mounting violence.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jul 17, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The escalating pattern of politically motivated violence in Burundi demands a response from the United Nations Security Council before the hostilities can evolve into wholesale atrocities, a group of the Organization's independent experts have warned. 
		 "The international community must not simply stand by and wait for mass atrocities to unfold, thereby risking a major conflict of regional proportions before it finally decides to act," the experts said in a statement released today by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
		According to the UN, civil unrest erupted on 26 April in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, after the ruling Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD) party elected President Pierre Nkurunziza on 25 April as its candidate for the then-scheduled 26 June presidential election. 
		 Mr. Nkurunziza has been in office for two terms since 2005, and a broad array of actors warned that an attempt to seek a third term was unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of the 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi that ended a decade of civil war in the country. 
		 The mounting violence across Burundi has also provoked a widespread humanitarian crisis as refugees have spilled across the country's borders and fanned throughout the region. Indeed, by late last week, more than 145,000 people had already fled to neighbouring countries. 
		 In today's statement, the experts, which include Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns; Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul; Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; Michel Forst; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye; Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, Maina Kiai; and the Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Seong-Phil Hong, added their concern that the situation in Burundi was accumulating "the well-known and visible marks of a society which previously suffered divisions leading to grave violence." 
		 "This can escalate into major conflict through the use of outright repression against, and intimidation of, the population at large, the instrumentalization of the police, the closure of independent media, as well as the detention of the opposition and other civic leaders," they continued. "We also witness efforts to coerce the judiciary, some of whose highest members have fled the country claiming their lives were at risk." 
		 At the same time, noted the Special Rapporteurs, armed militias, with the collaboration of authorities, exercised targeted violence against civilians. 
		 Burundi's elections, originally scheduled for 15 July, have now been postponed by six days to 21 July in order to mitigate the effects the tensions may have on the final vote. However, the delay, the experts cautioned, did not remedy the atmosphere of fear pervading throughout the country. 
		 To that point, they appealed to the Security Council to exercise its "unique role for peace and security and for preventing conflicts worldwide" and address the crisis head-on. 
		 "This is a crisis that is eminently preventable - everyone can see the risks. What is lacking is action," underscored the independent experts. "Given the painful history of Burundi and the region, the long engagement of the United Nations in the country to re-build peace, the Security Council must be all the more alerted to the increasing potential of an escalation of massive violence."

<titre>Burundi: UN condemns assassination attempt on leading human rights defender.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Aug 04, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations human rights office have strongly condemned the assassination attempt on Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, a leading Burundian human rights defender who was shot and wounded by unknown assailants in the capital on Monday. 
		 In a statement issued yesterday evening by his spokesperson, Mr. Ban wished Mr. Mbonimpa a full and speedy recovery and called for a prompt and transparent investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice.
		"This incident, which comes only a day after the killing of General Adolphe Nshimirimana, is part of a growing pattern of politically-motivated violence in Burundi that must be broken before it escalates beyond control. 
		 "The Secretary-General stresses that accountability and the resumption of a genuine and inclusive political dialogue are the best response to such attempts to destabilize Burundi." 
		 According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Mr. Mbonimpa was badly injured after being shot four times, including in the neck, by two people on a motorbike yesterday evening in Bujumbura while he was on his way home. 
		 OHCHR also voiced deep concern at the brutal arrest and ill treatment, on 2 August, of the RFI and AFP local correspondent, Esdras Ndikumana, by agents belonging to the Service national de renseignement (SNR), the national intelligence agency. 
		 "Mr. Ndikumana was taking pictures on the crime site where General Adolphe Nshimirimana was killed on 2 August, when he was arrested and brutalized by SNR agents," OHCHR spokesperson Cecile Pouilly told a news briefing in Geneva. 
		 "They took him to their HQ in Bujumbura and reportedly subjected him to torture, claiming that he was a 'journalist enemy'. Mr. Ndikumana is currently under medical care, suffering from a broken finger and psychological trauma." 
		 OHCHR called on the Burundian authorities to launch "prompt, transparent and thorough investigations" into these very serious incidents and ensure that those responsible are held to account, stressing that impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations must stop. 
		 It also condemned the killing of General Nshimirimana and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. In addition, the Office voiced concern about the large number of arbitrary arrests over the last few months. More than 600 people have been arrested and remain in detention without charge, some of them since April. 
		 Civil unrest erupted on 26 April in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, after the ruling Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD) party elected President Pierre Nkurunziza on 25 April as its candidate for the then-scheduled 26 June presidential election, which was twice postponed. 
		 Mr. Nkurunziza has been in office for two terms since 2005, and a broad array of actors warned that an attempt to seek a third term was unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of the 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi that ended a decade of civil war in the country.

<titre>Burundi: after 'broadly peaceful' polls Ban urges parties to resume inclusive political dialogue.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jul 23, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Taking note of the "broadly peaceful" conduct of polling in the Burundian presidential elections on 21 July, the top United Nations official today called on all parties to continue to remain calm and immediately resume an inclusive political dialogue. 
		 "Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calls on the Burundian parties to engage in good faith in the political dialogue putting Burundi's national interests first and fully determined to implement the relevant outstanding provisions of the 6 July East African Community (EAC) summit outcome document," reads a statement issued by the UN Spokesperson.
		Among other things, the said document stipulates that "whoever wins the presidential elections in Burundi should form a government of national unity involving those who participated in elections and those who did not." 
		 The Secretary-General, adds the UN Spokesperson, reminds the Burundian authorities of their responsibility to guarantee and protect the safety and security of the civilian population and ensure an end to further acts of violence, as well as accountability for any human rights violations committed. 
		 "In this regard, the Secretary-General welcomes the deployment of AU human rights observers and military experts aimed at helping prevent an escalation of violence and facilitating a peaceful resolution of the serious political crisis affecting Burundi." 
		 Civil unrest erupted on 26 April in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, after the ruling Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD) party elected President Pierre Nkurunziza on 25 April as its candidate for the then-scheduled 26 June presidential election. It was postponed to July 15, then July 21.

		 The mounting violence across Burundi has also provoked a widespread humanitarian crisis as refugees have spilled across the country's borders and fanned throughout the region. Indeed, by mid-July, more than 145,000 people had already fled to neighbouring countries.

		Feb 05, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- NetJets Europe, a Berkshire Hathaway-backed company and the worldwide leader in private aviation, today announced it has successfully obtained certification to operate its Signature Series Phenom 300 light aircraft at London City Airport. NetJets Europe is the largest private operator at the airport, with over fifty percent of all traffic. In 2014 alone, NetJets connected to 374 destinations across the globe out of the financial heart of London. 
		 Over 53 percent of NetJets' European customer base comes from the London finance sector - with private equity and hedge fund management seeing the most growth over the past twelve months. In 2014, 41 percent of new business in Europe was generated from the financial industry - demonstrating the recovery taking place in that sector.
		Mark Wilson, NetJets Europe President and COO said: "Private aviation continues to play a key role in the city, especially with London emerging as the economic growth engine not only for the UK, but also Europe. Our fractional ownership model is an unrivalled business tool when customers have access to over 100 aircraft across Europe, serving more than 900 airports across the continent. Commercial airlines are unable to offer the same level of flexibility and choice - meaning NetJets Europe is more relevant than ever before." 
		 NetJets Europe worked closely with the aviation authorities to obtain certification for the Phenom 300 to fly to London City Airport. This required considerable time and financial investment for pilots to train and perfect the steep approach, short runway and proximity to the city's tall landmark buildings. "NetJets is committed to safety and we set training standards for our flight crew that go above and beyond the requirements of aviation authorities across the globe," added Mark Wilson. "As part of our certification, we paid particular attention to the stringent noise requirements of the airport - which the whisper-quiet Phenom 300 meets by a large margin." 
		 Speed and efficiency is a core requirement for those flying privately and NetJets Europe customers now save over two hours on their overall journey time by using London City Airport. One of the airline's most popular city-pairs is London to Paris-Le Bourget Airport. Flight volumes on this route grew by 10.6 percent year-on-year from 2013 to 2014 - 3.3 percent ahead of the overall industry growth rate. Customers can now go from their desk in Canary Wharf to closing a business deal in <mention id="1871">La Defense</mention> on a Phenom 300 in 1.5 hours*. 
		 Declan Collier, CEO of London City Airport said: "NetJets Europe continues to play a significant role in the development of the private aviation market in the UK and Europe. We are pleased to see standards being raised further with the certification of the Phenom 300. Its arrival at the Jet Centre offers a new flying experience to our customers. Those choosing to fly into London City are choosing the nearest airport to central London - just four miles from Canary Wharf, seven miles from the City and nine miles from Mayfair - and can enjoy our 90 second promise from aircraft to car. It is therefore a perfect fit to announce the new light jet aircraft of choice for discerning travellers, at the private jet centre of choice in the UK's capital. We look forward to welcoming NetJets' Phenom 300 passengers and helping to make their journey special." 
		 NetJets placed an order for 125 Phenom 300 aircraft - including sixty firm orders - as part of a $17.6bn investment in its 700-strong global fleet. It has become the company's fastest-selling jet to date. There are currently 36 aircraft flying globally, each one has been custom fitted with NetJets' Signature Series interiors - making them completely bespoke to any other Phenom 300 in the market. 
		 "We are very delighted to celebrate this milestone with NetJets Europe. The Phenom 300 is the top performer in its class, and the ideal aircraft for airports like London City", said Peter Griffith, Embraer Vice President Marketing &amp; Sales, Europe and Africa. "It's our commitment to support our customers in their operation with Embraer's ample European support organisation, and I'm confident that the Phenom 300, now operated from and to London City, will be a real game-changer for NetJets' European customers." 
		 Today's announcement follows swiftly after NetJets also paved the way for the long range Bombardier Global 6000 jet to fly into London City Airport last year. 
		 *Based on a 10-minute car journey from Canary Wharf to London City Airport, a 90-second boarding process, a 50-minute flight on a Phenom 300 aircraft and a 30-minute drive from Paris-Le Bourget Airport to <mention id="1872">La Defense</mention>.

<titre>Paris attempts to lure business from London with new skyscrapers</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		Paris will build seven new skyscrapers in <mention id="1873">its business district</mention> as part of an aggressive campaign to lure financial services companies from London after the UK leaves the EU. 
		 As much as 375,000 sq m of office space, about the size of 50 football pitches, will be built by 2021 as part of the city's wider efforts to "accommodate the new talent" coming to the city.
		Marie-Célie Guillaume, chief executive of Defacto La Défense, the body responsible for managing <mention id="1874">the financial hub in western Paris</mention>, said that they wanted to send a "powerful message to businesses that are uncertain about their future in London".  
		 Paris is vying with Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin to attract banks, insurers, start-ups and other companies worried about what will happen when Britain leaves the political bloc. Paris has been one of the most aggressive in its efforts. 
		 Immediately after the June 23 referendum, President François Hollande's socialist government changed the tax rules for expatriates in Paris to make it more generous, and put together a high-level team to lobby international companies. 
		 On a visit to London on Tuesday, Emmanuel Macron, the independent French presidential candidate and frontrunner to win the election in May, said he wants British "banks, talents, researchers, academics" to move to France after Brexit. 
		 Senior bankers in the UK and France have expressed scepticism that Paris could become the new financial hub of Europe, citing inflexibility of the French labour code, the language barrier and high taxes. 
		 They say, however, that some operations in London that rely on EU "passporting" rights to operate across the bloc could move to the continent. 
		 In January, HSBC became the first big bank to confirm plans to move jobs out of London after the Brexit vote, saying it aims to relocate 1,000 roles in its London-based investment bank to Paris. 
		 UBS said about the same number of its London employees could be affected by Brexit, while Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said that more than 4,000 of his bank's 16,000 UK staff could be displaced. Neither has yet said where they might move, however. 
		 In September, French financial regulators said they were simplifying the process of registering new financial companies in Paris, in part by allowing documents to be filed in English. They said this came "in the context of the Brexit vote". 
		 <mention id="1875">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> late last year unveiled an advertising campaign aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, with the slogan: "Tired of the fog? Try the frogs!"

		 GETTING around's not easy at the moment for cocker spaniel Sam. 
		 But the pot on his leg is all part of the healing process after operations funded by well-wishers. 
		 The Gazette told last April how Sam - then aged only six weeks - was brought to Saltburn Animal Rescue Association (SARA) with what was thought to be a leg injury but was actually a deformed front paw, caused by a genetic condition, which needed specialist - and expensive - treatment.

		 By Dave Robson Senior Reporter dave.robson@trinitymirror.com But it was later discovered to be a genetic condition that would need specialist, and expensive, treatment. 
		 But even though his leg isn't holding him back at the moment, Ann says it can't be left uncorrected. 
		 But on closer inspection, it became clear that he has a genetic condition which sees one of his front paws bend back under his leg. 
		 Sam's paw is folded back over on itself, meaning he essentially has to walk on his "ankle". 
		 Our top tips for boosting But after SARA supporters raised more than PS5,000 in just two weeks, work to correct his leg could begin. 
		 AT first glance, cheeky cocker spaniel Sam seems like any boisterous puppy. 
		 She said: "He's a cheeky boy - naughty, demanding but very, very lovable, and he runs around like a normal puppy. 
		 Now aged four months, Sam is loving life with his foster carers and running around like any other boisterous pup, but his leg is already showing signs that the problem can't be left uncorrected. 
		 But look closer and you can see a deformed front paw which, if left uncorrected, would mean major problems in later life. 
		 Ann said: "Following advice and x-rays by our local vet, it was decided it wasn't an injury - he was born with this deformity - but to put it right would require quite a difficult and costly operation. 
		 Try something new. -try changing your and notice the world Be aware of the present moment; your thoughts and feelings, your body and the world around you After being quoted in the region of PS5,500 for the surgery, SARA sent out an SOS - Save Our Sam - pleading for donations. 
		 "But if you have an animal with a dangling leg, it can be dangerous. He could get it trapped in something and it's just going to get worse. 
		 And in just a fortnight, animal lovers on Teesside exceeded the amount needed. 
		 Animal charity Saltburn Animal Rescue Association believes Sam deserves to enjoy life on four paws. 
		 MINDFULness is about allowing ourselves When we do that, it can positively change "He's managing now but as he grows older, it will be very disabling and could even result in him losing the leg. To do nothing isn't an option." 
		 With this in mind, and wanting to get the best for him, we contacted Fitzpatrick Referrals. "They said yes, they can operate and hopefully put his paw right, but it could cost us anything up to PS5,500. 
		 SARA chairman Ann Prosser said: "We just want to express our gratitude to The Gazette and readers who donated. It's been a really humbling experience. 
		 However, if you are constantly feeling mood, or if you just need to talk, "We didn't expect to get the lot - he was going to have the surgery any way - we were going to make it happen somehow, get the full amount, little bit over, quickly is fantastic. 
		 And while it's been a long road, with lots of pots, physio, hydrotherapy and TLC, our pictures and video show he's nearly there. 
		 But with the team behind Channel Four TV show The Supervet quoting up to PS5,500 for the surgery, SARA has now issued an SOS plea - Save Our Sam - to help pay for his treatment. 
		 Nearly PS600 has already been pledged, but there's still a long way to go.

<titre>Old homes and new homelands: imagining the nation and remembering expulsion in the wake of the Mali Federation's collapse.</titre>
<auteur>MARIE RODET</auteur>
<texte>
		10.1017/S0001972018000189 
		 Abstract 
		 This article examines concepts of 'home' and 'abroad' for migrants and citizens in the twilight of empire. It focuses on the 'cheminots refoules', railway workers with origins in the former French Sudan (today's Republic of Mali) who were expelled from Senegal shortly after both territories declared independence, and other 'Sudanese' settled in Senegal, sometimes for several generations. Using newly available archives in France, Mali and Senegal, and interviews with former cheminots and 'Sudanese migrants' on both sides of the border, this article seeks to historicize memories of autochthony and allochthony that have been constructed and contested in postcolonial nation-building projects. The Mali Federation carried the lingering memory of federalist political projects, but it proved untenable only months after the Federation's June 1960 independence from France. When member states declared independence from each other, the internal boundary between Senegal and the Sudanese Republic became an international border between Senegal and the Republic of Mali. In the wake of the collapse, politicians in Bamako and Dakar clamoured to redefine the 'nation' and its 'nationals' through selective remembering. Thousands of cheminots and 'Sudanese migrants' who had moved to Senegal from Sudan years (or decades) earlier were suddenly labelled 'foreigners' and 'expatriates' and faced two governments eager to see them 'return' to a hastily proclaimed nation state. This 'repatriation' allowed Republic of Mali officials to 'perform the nation' by (re)integrating and (re)membering the migrants in a nascent 'homeland'. But, having circulated between Senegal and Sudan/Mali for decades, 'Sudanese migrants' in both states retained and invoked memories of older political communities, upsetting new national priorities. The loss of the Mali Federation raises questions about local, national and international citizenship and movement in mid-century West Africa. Examining the histories invoked to imagine postcolonial political communities, this article offers an insight into the role that memory has played in constructing and contesting the nation's central place in migration histories within Africa and beyond.
		Resume 
		 Cet article examine les concepts " d'etre chez soi " et " d'etranger " pour les migrants et les citoyens au crepuscule de l'empire. Il porte son attention sur les " cheminots refoules " originaires de l'ancien Soudan francais (l'actuelle Republique du Mali) qui furent expulses du Senegal peu apres la declaration d'independance de ces deux pays. Il s'interesse egalement aux autres " Soudanais " installes au Senegal, parfois sur plusieurs generations. A partir d'archives recemment ouvertes en France, au Mali et au Senegal, et d'entretiens avec d'anciens cheminots et " migrants soudanais ", de part et d'autre de la frontiere, cet article cherche a historiciser les memoires d'autochtonie et d'allochtonie construites et contestees dans des projets postcoloniaux de construction nationale. La Federation du Mali se voulait porteuse de la memoire persistante de projets politiques federalistes, mais elle s'avera indefendable quelques mois seulement apres l'independance de la Federation de la France en juin 1960. Avec la rupture de la Federation, la frontiere interieure entre le Senegal et la Republique soudanaise devint une frontiere internationale entre le Senegal et la Republique du Mali. A la suite de cet effondrement, les politiciens a Bamako et a Dakar appelerent a redefinir la " nation " et ses " nationaux " par un processus de souvenir selectif. Des milliers de cheminots et de " migrants soudanais " qui avaient quitte le Soudan pour se rendre au Senegal des annees (voire des decennies) auparavant furent soudain etiquetes " etrangers " et " expatries ", confrontes a deux gouvernements desireux de les voir " retourner " dans un Etat-nation proclame a la hate. Ce " rapatriement " permit aux responsables de la Republique du Mali de " performer la nation " en (re)integrant les migrants et en les obligeant a (re)adherer a une " patrie " embryonnaire. Or, ayant circule entre le Senegal et le Soudan/Mali pendant des decennies, ces " migrants soudanais " conservaient des souvenirs de communautes politiques bien plus anciennes, qu'ils commencerent des lors a revendiquer, contrariant ainsi les nouvelles priorites nationales. La fin de la Federation du Mali interroge les citoyennetes locales, nationales et internationales et la mobilite en Afrique de l'Ouest dans la deuxieme moitie du vingtieme siecle. En examinant les recits invoques pour imaginer des communautes politiques postcoloniales, cet article apporte un eclairage nouveau sur le role qu'a joue la memoire dans la construction et la contestation de la centralite de la nation dans les recits migratoires en Afrique et ailleurs. 
		 Introduction 
		 The Mali Federation collapsed on the night of 19-20 August 1960. It was the tragic end of an ambitious project to preserve ties between French West Africa's eight territories as nationalist politicians renegotiated their relationship to France and the French empire. The idea of African federalism was not new on the continent but gained its momentum in the 1950s and 1960s against the backdrop of expanding pan-Africanist ideas and decolonization, which led to the creation of several federations such as the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation (1952) and the East African Community (1967). Most of these federal experiences were deemed to fail, though mostly due to increasing competition over political leadership and differing socio-political views, in a context of heightened tensions between socio-cultural diversity and emerging territorial and national identity. In the case of the constitution of the Mali Federation, whose main initial political goal was to preserve the unity of the late French West African Federation, France and Cote d'Ivoire clearly opposed the project in defence of their political and economic interests and ultimately succeeded in preventing Upper Volta and Dahomey from joining in 1958 (Kurtz 1970). 
		 In its final phase, the Mali Federation joined only Senegal and the Sudanese Republic in a union that lasted only nineteen months--and only two months of formal independence. In the final two months, preparations for the Mali Federation's presidential election exacerbated social and political tensions as Leopold Sedar Senghor and Modibo Keita rallied supporters in their respective constituent republics. The campaign for the federal presidency represented two different ideas of nationalism and decolonization: Senghor, president of the Mali federal assembly, wanted to maintain ties with France, and believed in distinct and discrete nationalities; Keita's Union Soudanaise-RDA (Rassemblement Democratique Africain, hereafter US-RDA) favoured a definitive break with the colonial past, closer relations with the Soviet bloc, and an incorporative idea of the nation that would, over time, unify postcolonial categories of belonging into an inclusive and expanding panAfrican federalism. 
		 A week before the election, Keita, the federal government's provisional head, accused Senegalese leaders of plotting with Paris to dissolve the Federation. Senghor and Mamadou Dia, vice-president of the Federation, in return mobilized Senegalese troops to secure against fears of a Sudanese coup. In a suburban Dakar station thirty-six hours later, 130 people under military guard--all high-ranking Sudanese officials and their families were forced aboard an express train bound for Bamako. The passengers disembarked at Kidira, the riverside town that marked both the geographic centre of the Dakar-Niger railway and the border between the Federation's two constituent republics. Now, it was the end of the Senegalese line. Crossing the railway bridge on foot, Modibo Keita entered the Sudanese Republic to a hero's welcome. He climbed aboard a Sudanese train and continued eastward to Bamako. At every station, crowds turned out to cheer Keita and hear his denunciation of the federal collapse, French neocolonialist designs, and the treachery of the Senegalese politicians who had struck a bargain to trade African unity for national sovereignty. Within a month, politicians in Senegal and the renamed Republic of Mali, rushing to salvage political legitimacy from the federal wreckage, had proclaimed separate independences on each side of their shared border. (1) 
		 For the cheminots (railwaymen) of the Dakar-Niger railway, their families and, more generally, the Sudanese living in Senegal, the Federation's collapse brought different problems. Under French rule, inter-territorial labour unions and migration had shaped politics and social ties that spanned the colonial borders. As in other colonial territories on the continent, those railwaymen forged alliances and came to the forefront of socio-political movements against colonial rule and its discriminatory policies (Cooper 1996; Grillo 1973). Yet, with the tense independence that split 1,288 kilometres of railway, people in station towns were forced to re-evaluate their relationship with their places of residence. For those populations originally from French Sudan who had been living in Senegal for decades, and sometimes even for several generations, the collapse forced the difficult choice of either staying in a country whose political leaders had overtly expressed great hostility towards their now ascribed 'homeland' or returning to a country that they or their ancestors had left under very different political and social circumstances. In the following months, patriotic appeals and administrative pressures persuaded thousands of cheminots, their families, and other Sudanese populations living in Senegal to cross the Faleme River and return to their 'homeland' over the now international border. In Malian Kayes, Senegalese Thies and the other railway towns between Dakar and Bamako, generations of trade, travel, migration and labour activism had sustained ties and shaped expectations that differed from national priorities set in new national capitals (Jones 2002; Rodet and County forthcoming). Indeed, populations along the railway had developed enduring intergenerational and translocal links between Mali and Senegal, with people regularly travelling back and forth between regions along the railway (Rodet 2008). They shaped translocal communities through specific * * remembering of 'home' and 'homeland' (indeed, in 'remembering', one can find 'member'; see Rodet and Reinprecht 2013). (2) 
		 Stung by Senegalese leaders' actions, the Sudanese Republic closed the border to all trade with its former partner. (3) The Dakar-Niger railway and the people who lived by it suffered the most immediate effects of this decision. Senegalese officials in Bakel, on the border with Mali, had complained that Malian customs agents had confiscated over 750,000 CFA francs from Senegalese nationals crossing from Mali in September and October I960. (4) In turn, these officials began to confiscate cash held by migrant workers returning to Mali in early 1961. (5) Besides, with international freight traffic blocked, Senegalese railway operations changed dramatically. Kidira, the station town that had marked the midpoint of the federal railway, was transformed into a distant outpost in independent Senegal's eastern borderlands. The Senegalese railway's centre of gravity shifted to the urban centres of the coast and the trading stations in the peanut basin. With service reduced, the Senegalese railway authorities began to reduce the number of workers employed. Approximately one-quarter of the more than 5,000 cheminots working in Senegal had been 'Nationals of the Sudanese Republic' under federal law. (6) Most of the railway's administrative staff in Thies hailed from the Sudanese Republic. (7) Far fewer Senegalese cheminots worked in the smaller railway centres on the Sudanese side of the border. (8) Any exchange of nationals would be lopsided. 
		 The political implications of the Federation's collapse have been widely analysed by political scientists and historians alike, but the social dimensions and the lived experiences of those events by the concerned populations--cheminots and others--have been barely touched upon. This article explores these often unheard voices of the decolonization process in West Africa. In particular, it attempts to examine how Sudanese populations who were settled in Senegal at the time of the Federation's collapse navigated the national identity that was newly ascribed to them by the Senegalese and Malian authorities and the extent to which their experiences and memories of 'home' and 'homeland' permeated the way in which they adapted to the new political situation. 
		 Here, memories and migration were certainly central social and political challenges of decolonization: migrants' experiences and practices sometimes conflicted with new national memories in the making, highlighting the complexities of the processes of building a national identity in the wake of independence. Thus, examining complex histories and memories of 'home' and 'homeland' along the Dakar-Niger railway, this article sheds light on multi-layered and sometimes competing processes of both national and diasporic identity building at the time of the decolonization process in West Africa. The article ultimately attempts to examine how perceptions of the past, in confrontation with the political and social realities of the time, affected the incorporation of 'migrants' in independent Senegal and Mali. 
		 Disputed memories of belonging: territory, nationality and affiliation in the Mali Federation 
		 In order to prevent the balkanization of French West Africa, the Sudanese Republic merged on 4 April 1959 with Senegal to form the Mali Federation, which became entirely self-governing when it gained independence from France on 20 June 1960. The idea of this formation mainly relied on both a pan-Africanist ideal and the memories of long-standing economic, social and cultural connections dating back to the West African precolonial empires. Over generations, and in a much more accelerated manner since the construction of the Dakar-Niger railway under French colonial rule at the beginning of the twentieth century, numerous families had built translocal lives sustained by continuous flows of people, goods and experiences back and forth and intermarriages over several generations from the Sudanese hinterland to the Senegalese coast (David 1980; Manchuelle 1997; Rodet 2009; 2015). Many people living and working in Senegal in the 1950s located their family history in French Sudan and thought of it as 'home', even if they had spent little or no time there. 
		 Under the federal Malian structure, Sudanese politicians and technocrats had moved into the administrative offices of the former French West Africa and the stately villas of the former French administrators. Senegalese officials and citizens chafed at seeing Sudanese in offices that had been disproportionately staffed by Senegalese clerks during the period of French rule. An anonymous Senegalese bureaucrat complained that 'you had to speak Bambara to get anything done in the Administrative Building', so great was the Sudanese presence (Foltz 1965: 148). Acutely aware of the Federation's demographic imbalance, many Senegalese worried that Sudanese interests would dominate the new state, just as the growing cadre of Sudanese bureaucrats seemed to dominate Dakar (Ndiaye 1980: 31-2). Speaking in Wolof just days before the Federation's collapse, Mamadou Dia made an even more unlikely claim. 'Our country was colonized by France. Today we no longer suffer this arrangement. We have become free and independent. It is not to allow another country, and above all a territory so similar to our own, to come and colonize us in turn' (quoted in Zuccarelli 1988: 82). 
		 The same day Modibo Keita's train left Dakar, Sudanese cheminots in Thies, 'visibly sad' at the news, wondered aloud about their fate in Senegal. (9) The physical rails quickly became 'Senegalese' when the railway was nationalized after the Federation split, but for people living and working along the rails, the question of citizenship was more hotly contested. Dialimady Koite, secretary-general of Mali's railway workers' union, condemned the events in Dakar and proclaimed the union's indefatigable support for 'the Malian cheminots living in Senegal'. (10) 
		 Officials in Bamako recognized that the cash-poor country would require considerable human effort to meet their socialist goals. They appealed to expatriate citizens of the former Sudanese Republic to 'return' and build the new Mali (Gary-Tounkara 2008: 200-2). (11) The call was addressed particularly to cheminots working in Senegal, many of whom had graduated from colonial French Sudan's few technical schools. (12) While Keita, Koite and other political leaders pleaded with skilled workers to join Mali's new national railway, Senegal had a different problem. Graduates of Bamako's Terrasson de Fougeres technical school dominated the railway's highest ranks. Thus, Senegalese cheminots and trade unionists often attempted to convince their Sudanese colleagues and friends to stay despite the collapse, claiming that the collapse was purely political, and they ultimately remained united as cheminots. (13) 
		 In the twilight of empire, nationalist politicians and new states in West Africa assumed that family histories rooted in colonial and precolonial territories and polities would extend to postcolonial citizenship (Malkki 1992; County and Skinner 2008; Mann 2015). With the September 1960 'socialist option' of the Republic of Mali, Modibo Keita announced that the new state included people far beyond its borders. In a radio broadcast, he named several prominent Federation loyalists from Senegal. The new republic included them 'and all the other Senegalese who have remained faithful to their vows and their commitment to the Federal government'. (14) 
		 The question of nationality before the Federation's collapse had primarily been a Senegalese question. Long the seat of the French West Africa government, Dakar maintained its political primacy in 1959 when it was named the Mali Federation's capital. Frederick Cooper claims that the politicians and intellectuals in charge of Senegal in the late 1950s argued for a distinction between a unified citizenship for all Africans living in the French Union (and later French Community) and a set of nationalities whose membership would be determined by territorial governments (Cooper 2015). Yet Modibo Keita, on the Sudanese side, had been hostile to a unified citizenship and more generally opposed to further common institutions with France within the framework of the French Community. And despite the Senegalese claims for a unified citizenship, a practical distinction between Sudanese and Senegalese had a long history in Senegal, which relied on the memories of the two distinct cultural, economic and social spaces of the colonial era instead of the historical continuum claimed by political leaders at the time of the constitution of the Federation. The term 'Bambara' in particular had a long history of praise and stigmatization in Senegalese (colonial) records, where they represented the 'other', and very often the slaves. (15) The cheminots and their families heading from French Sudan and living in Senegal on the eve of the Federation's collapse further experienced this distinction: while they were often called 'Sudanese' or 'Bambara' by the local Senegalese populations, they also attempted in some cases to defend their specificity by priding themselves on keeping Bamanankan as the main language spoken at home and on maintaining social ties with their 'homeland' through the steady flows of information, goods and people along the Dakar-Niger railway (Rodet 2015). Mahmadou Sacko, whose father worked as a construction supervisor for the Dakar-Niger railway in the early twentieth century, explained how he and his siblings were forbidden by their parents from speaking Wolof at home in Thies. (16) 
		 Distinction was also reinforced by the railway reorganization and the devolution of its competencies to the former administrative regions, as well as 'Africanization' measures that replaced metropolitan French employees with Africans in the post-war processes of decolonization. The commission charged with dividing the federal colonial railway authority issued a decision that localized the employment of cheminots, transferring employment status and pension responsibility from the former colonial railway divisions (regions) to the newly autonomous public companies (regies). It created the category of 'depayse' (relocated), which was applied to African workers from outside the colony who received financial compensation for working away from home (Tixier 1965: 931-2). This in turn led to a series of personnel moves that these new authorities designed in order to cut costs by reducing the number of workers from outside the territory of each new regie (ibid:. 923-4). Thus, the 4 February 1960 order that eliminated the category of 'depayse' was particularly important in the Mali Federation. Levelling pay provided a disincentive for cheminots to remain in jobs outside their home territory, but it also equalized payment for all Malians no matter which constituent republic they called home. Yet, despite the official abolition of relocation bonuses in February, the Dakar-Niger railway still calculated expatriate worker salaries at a higher rate. The expatriate category initially applied to French cheminots working in the colonies, but Senegal's declaration of independence from the Mali Federation transformed de facto Sudanese cheminots from nationals to expatriates. Worried about the increased labour costs and the possibility of layoffs should the railway administration decide to keep some or all of its top-level Sudanese employees on the expatriate pay grade, Senegalese cheminots protested against any such unequal pay scale. (17) Rumour spread that the Senegalese government would not pay Thies's sizeable contingent of Sudanese at all. (18) 
		 Immediately after the Federation's collapse, more than four-fifths of the cheminots working in Senegal were Sudanese, and although Senegal's national railway could certainly not maintain this entire workforce, if all of them left the country and the railway at the same time, the railway risked being paralyzed. (19) At the beginning of September 1960, at a meeting of Sudanese Terrasson graduates in Rufisque, a teacher working in Dakar said that if Sudan's cheminots and public works employees left Senegal, Sudan could reconquer the rebellious republic and reunite the Federation, (20) a statement that echoed to some extent some of the concerns addressed by Dia before the collapse. 
		 In its truncated 1960 annual report, Senegal's newly created national railway authority stated that it could not maintain the workforce it had inherited and, in October 1960, it decided that members of 'the group of Sudanese serving in Senegal' would 'return to their country of origin'. (21) In the second week of October, 400 cheminots and their families boarded trains in Thies for an overnight voyage that would end at the border at noon. (22) Railway officials on both sides of the border were unsure if they could send the Senegalese train into Malian territory, so the passengers disembarked at Kidira, trudged across the railway bridge to Diboly, and boarded trains sent by the Republic of Mali's newly organized national railway. By November, over 1,000 cheminots--and several thousand relatives and dependants--had crossed the Faleme bridge. (23) Other state employees with ties to Sudan also left Senegal in response to official decisions, social pressures and political appeals (Traore 2005: 80-2). (24) Reluctant repatriates and anticipatory nationalists alike bade farewell to their jobs, their friends and their families in Senegal, loaded their possessions onto eastbound trains, and 'returned' to the Republic of Mali for the very first time. 
		 The Federation's collapse certainly became a founding national moment for the newly declared Republic of Mali, which henceforth experienced a particularly heightened nationalist climate (Campmas 1978: 199; Rillon 2013: 92). When the Republic of Mali and families in Mali called on their children abroad to 'return', this call garnered an overwhelming response. People who had spent only months in Senegal headed east alongside people who had been bom there. Cheik Doumbia, who was bom in Kaolack of Sudanese parents and had been working for the railway since 1951, had never thought of resettling in Mali, but after the Federation collapsed, his father, a stationmaster in Kayes, sent a telegram: 'come if you have received decision'. The younger Doumbia had no choice but to obey his father's call. (25) Government bureaucrats, cheminots, artisans and students all heeded similar calls. Young mothers boarded the eastbound trains with newborn babies in their arms. (26) After a difficult trip, a festive and patriotic reception met them at the border. The US-RDA leadership in Kayes mobilized party activists, musicians, dancers and cooks to transform the experience of expulsion into a happy homecoming. 'Fasobaara, anw ka fasobaara ke, ' they sang in Bamanankan, exhorting each other to 'work to build the nation'. (27) Every day for nearly three weeks, 300 to 400 volunteers set out from Kayes in special trains. Members of the US-RDA women's association cooked meals for the repatriates to eat after they arrived on Malian soil and social workers provided first aid for adults and children. (28) Similar scenes were repeated in each station of the railway from Kayes to Bamako. (29) The repatriated drifted to the homes of friends and relatives, or slept in converted public buildings and used Kayes as a staging area as they contacted relatives further down the line to arrange for more permanent accommodation. A retired cheminot in Mahina donated 100 kilograms of rice and slaughtered a bull to help feed the refoules lodged in and around the station. He also took up a collection to meet the new arrivals' needs and received 4,500 CFA francs, or approximately one month's salary for a new worker. (30) In the neighbouring administrative centre of Bafoulabe, residents denounced Senghor and Dia and demanded that all ties with Senegal be cut. Some of the town's older residents, recalling their experiences as migrant labourers in Senegal, were not surprised by the events in Dakar. Acerbically they assured young Malians that 'these acts of treachery are not new'. (31) 
		 In Bamako, officials made creative use of the resources available to help integrate repatriated workers. West of the city centre, 2,000 families of repatriates and urban migrants moved into waterlogged but free plots of land (Samake 1998: 35). (32) On the national level, the government deducted a small portion of the wages earned by the country's formal sector workers and used the money to establish a solidarity fund that paid repatriated cheminots half-salaries for twelve months, allowing them to meet their families' basic financial needs while officials worked to place them in new jobs (Traore 2005: 82). (33) Some left to work on the railways in neighbouring Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. (34) A few others went further afield to technical training programmes in Yugoslavia. (35) 
		 The plight of the repatriated cheminots had become rhetorically tied to the country and, more broadly, to the continuing political struggle against imperial domination. (36) On Radio Mali, announcers read a letter allegedly sent by sympathizers in Dakar who celebrated the new republic as a victory over French neocolonialism. They were careful to highlight that 'the Malians expelled from SENEGAL leave stronger because of their ordeal ... because those who have the sympathy of their people and of another people are twice as strong'. (37) The US-RDA leadership continued to thank party members in Kayes for their support of 'our brothers expelled from Senegal', one of the locality's many sacrifices 'to safeguard the dignity and the liberty of the whole Nation'. (38) Maintaining attention to the railway, Senegalese dissidents based in Bamako broadcast their disgust over 'the anguish in which the [Senegalese] cheminots have lived ... [S]ince the manufactured collapse of the Mali Federation, the Senegalese railway reports more than a billion [CFA francs] in deficit despite the shameful repatriation of Malian cheminots.' (39) 
		 Yet, as we shall see, some of the repatriated cheminots and the Sudanese living in Senegal who returned to Mali experienced a long and precarious journey in the process of resettlement, which disrupted their initial memories of 'home' and 'homeland' and their sense of belonging. 
		 Failing memories? The practicalities of belonging 
		 Most people recognized the symbolism of the early days of the Malian Republic, such as when the population of Bafoulabe 'congratulate[d] the party faithful of Kayes for how they handled the situation of the cheminots', and, because the trains' late arrival prevented them from offering such a spectacular welcome, they decided to redeem themselves by contributing more to the solidarity fund. (40) Government officials fretted over the slow pace of job creation and job placement for repatriated cheminots. The solidarity fund was meant to pay out after one year, a fact that the head of the railway nervously raised in a meeting of Bamako's regional officials in September 1961. (41) When the fund did end, it became both a pressing concern for those cheminots still without jobs and a test of the government's ability to give economic shape to its political rhetoric. Auxiliary workers, the lowest rank of permanent employees, were particularly worried. Police reports in Kayes noted that their situation 'remains as confused as ever, and this has caused them to worry'. Union officials promised new jobs in state industrial ventures, but cheminots recognized that 'the positions taken up by the Government have not always brought concrete results. A new worksite with 500 jobs cannot be achieved in the short term. Workers see the reality of this proposition and they remain pessimistic and impatient to hear the government's official decision.' (42) 
		 The arduous wait for news and jobs drove many cheminots to reappraise the possibilities offered by the new state. Those who secured work on the railway often traded prestige for employment. Mechanics took up partial employment as manual labourers, with hours slashed in order to offer part-time jobs to the remaining unemployed cheminots (43) In this context, the letter from a woman on behalf of her repatriate brother takes on extra significance. She pleaded with the governor of Kayes to find or create even a part-time job 'to save us from disgrace'. And, while the letter described her immediate family's dire straits, it also evoked a national concern. (44) In 1961, one man wrote to the regional governor in Kayes and alluded to the connection between repatriated workers and the state's duty to address the problems created by repatriation. Emphasizing his patriotic choice to leave Senegal, he introduced himself as 'a mechanic by profession' who had not worked in his field of expertise since 1956. 
		  I will gladly accept any task that is assigned to me in order to meet the needs of my family ... I used to live in Senegal, [and] at the collapse of the Mali Federation, I came to reinforce the ranks of those who build the Malian Nation, since all Malians aware of their duties had to return to Mali after all that the Senegalese had done. (45)  
		 Two months later, at a union meeting, a certain Diombana (46) publicly criticized the government's decision to encourage expatriates to return, since their subsequent unemployment had exposed the new republic's economic fragility. He continued, saying that: 'The work of the Government, as gigantic as it may be, will be in vain if one single repatriated worker remains unemployed, for it was shouted from the rooftops [in Senegal] that Mali will be incapable of accommodating all its repatriates.' (47) Diombana even claimed years later that he personally had regretted coming back to Mali: had he known what it would be like, he would have stayed in Senegal. (48) Some graduates of Ecole Terrasson also wrote to complain that they still had not found work years after the Federation's collapse. (49) 'Modibo was the first one expelled from Senegal,' cheminots often said in the early 1960s as a wry comment on how they felt betrayed by the new government. (50) Some cheminots' wives did not hesitate to castigate the Malian railway authorities about the conditions of their repatriation: numerous pieces of luggage had gone missing during the transfer from Kidira to Diboli. (51) 
		 Some of the repatriated soon became the objects of political suspicion and appeared as the new 'enemies within' since they did not intend to bend to the party's discipline. (52) Diombana spent some time in prison for insisting that, rather than force demoralized cheminots to squander their mechanical expertise and adopt agricultural labour, the government should have supported them so that the new country could profit from their skills. (53) Indeed, shortly after the welcome in Kayes, government representatives had come to railway towns and urged cheminots to take up farming jobs. Officials, including the mayor of Kayes (a cheminot union leader in the 1950s) and the national labour union coalition, criticized cheminots for refusing to farm, raise livestock and gather wood. One self-styled patriot in Kayes offered the national government his unsolicited advice, suggesting that the state provision the towns and villages along the railway so that 'all the native Malians 
		 now living in Senegal' could return to Mali and 'labour together to build the nation'. (54) Some cheminots did transfer their employment to work as local administrative agents, teachers or technical experts elsewhere in the country. (55) This seemed to be more out of necessity than choice, and government officials complained bitterly that cheminots were not interested in open posts outside the railway. (56) The government expected cheminots to do whatever work was asked of them--most commonly agricultural labour--in the same way as they requested the youth to 'return to the land' to build the new nation (Gary-Tounkara 2008; Rodet and County forthcoming). (57) 
		 Such a predicament demanded sacrifices. In a meeting in late November 1962, Dialimady Koite tried to encourage the members of his union to identify with the nation, asking them to 'work more than ever because it is necessary to build the nation'. (58) At the same meeting, Sibiri Kanoute, a delegate from Kayes, accepted the importance of nation building while he lambasted the government's attempts to draw the cheminots closer to the state: 
		  At the railway, you don't dare speak because you risk being labelled 'anti-nationalist' ... All the cheminots here have things to say. Who among you has nothing to say? ... But you don't dare. We struggled to chase away the European colonialists because they did not support the interests of the workers and the country. But those who are at the head of the railway now did not earn their place there ... We cheminots, we are determined to work in the country's best interests, but this burden must not be carried by the workers alone, it must be carried by everyone. (59)  
		 Everyone agreed that something had to be done to assist the repatriates who remained unemployed, but cheminots in Kayes had a more pointed critique, arguing that the fallout from the Federation's collapse was part of a national problem and not simply a problem for the railway. (60) 
		 While publicly proclaiming the repatriated cheminots' civic virtue, US-RDA leaders recognized that they often returned from Senegal carrying a different set of political values. Reports from Kita noted 'with satisfaction' that cheminots arriving from Senegal had made public declarations in favour of the new state and had conducted themselves well since their arrival. (61) In other towns, they challenged the established political leadership, for example when a group of repatriates in Bafoulabe accused the area's National Assembly deputy of cronyism and corruption. (62) The spark for this was that the deputy, Hamady Diallo, had said that all the refoules could not possibly stay in Mahina. 
		 Within the railway workers' union, repatriated cheminots formed an important interest group that coalesced into an irritated voting bloc as hundreds of them remained unemployed more than a year after arriving with the expectation of working for Mali's national railway. A government report on the railway warned that the repatriates 'recognize neither the union Leadership nor the Railway Administration, except through the mediation of their own representatives ... [T]he group from the region of Kayes has been the strongest due to the poor methods used to find jobs for repatriated agents.' (63) Reports of backroom negotiations at the highest levels of government show that the 'national interests' articulated in economic policy began to diverge from 'the interests of the workers'--or at least from those of railway workers. Despite the economic blow to the regional economy and the continued unemployment of hundreds of cheminots who had left Senegal, the leaders of the US-RDA could not agree to negotiating with their western neighbours to reopen the railway to international freight traffic. (64) In January 1962, police reports complained that merchants in Kayes talked loudly and openly about how the Dakar-Niger railway was Mali's ideal link to ports and world markets, far better than links with Guinea or Cote d'Ivoire. 
		 For the Malians who stayed in Senegal in the wake of the Federation's collapse, the issue of citizenship became particularly charged as its acquisition was required for access to polling stations, social services, and even bursaries for students. Demba Traore, originally from Kayes, explained how he was obliged to return to Mali following the collapse although he had been a pupil in Diourbel since 1958. (65) His father had left French Sudan several years earlier for Senegal in order to find work. At the time of his departure from Kayes, he had entrusted his children to his brother. Later, he had managed to bring Demba to Senegal so that he could pursue his education. But because of the collapse, Demba had to acquire Senegalese nationality in order to obtain a bursary and pursue his studies. Yet, his father categorically opposed this. Demba had to return to Mali in January 1961 with his brother, who was in the same situation. Arouna Coulibaly, bom in 1940 in Kobongoye in the Senegalese Siin and whose father had migrated from Nioro in French Sudan to Senegal in 1924, was doing the paperwork to establish his citizenship in Senegal when the Federation collapsed. (66) He ultimately decided to establish his identity papers in the name of Fall, the Wolof equivalent of the Mande patronym Coulibaly, to prevent any further administrative issues because of his Malian origins in this period of high diplomatic tensions. 
		 Independent Senegal struggled with its history as French West Africa's political centre. Nationals of neighbouring countries--particularly Mali--had grounds to make material claims on the Senegalese state without necessarily offering their political support. To avoid a flood of requests, these colonial and federal claims could not be accorded the same status as the needs of Senegalese citizens, and the state limited a broad range of services. This strategy created an environment in which officials judged citizenship applications with an ahistorical view of the country's political past and an eye for minimizing the state's financial obligations. One Sudanese-born applicant who had lived in Senegal since World War One drew a wary note for having a 'definite [financial] interest' in acquiring citizenship in the country that was home to all his material investments as well as the source of his quarterly pension. (67) The citizenship requirement was stated more explicitly in the analysis of the right of a Malian cheminot's widows to collect pensions from the new national railway. (68) One man born in Kayes had moved to Senegal before his tenth birthday and applied for Senegalese citizenship shortly after leaving the army in late 1961. His file suggests he was a strong candidate: four years of schooling in the colonial system, six years as an apprentice carpenter in the Dakar-Niger workshops in Thies, and thirteen years of army service, mostly peaceful tours in Senegal. He had never fallen foul of the law and posed no risk to public safety. He spoke fluent Wolof, had married a Senegalese woman, and lodged his family in the home of a Dakar police officer. Although his file indicated that he was 'perfectly integrated into Senegalese society [la collectivite senegalaise]', he had not held a job since leaving the army six months earlier and had no personal wealth. In his report to the governor of Cap-Vert, the regional police chief opined that such an applicant 'offers nothing of interest to Senegal'. (69) 
		 Around the same time, repatriated cheminots had to navigate between their uncertain position within Mali's shaky economy and the certainty of their memories and enduring relationships in Senegal. Many of the Sudanese cheminots who left Senegal had held important posts in the railway (especially those based in Thies) and owned property in the city either near the railway's bureaucratic headquarters or in one of the working-class neighbourhoods associated with cheminot life in each station town. In large cities such as Thies and Tambacounda, their former neighbours managed these properties, collected rents, paid taxes, and at regular intervals transferred the remaining money to the repatriated proprietors in Mali. (70) Some of these Malian workers returned to Senegal after their retirement, and sometimes even before then, as we shall see, to find their homes waiting for them. 
		 When connected memories strike back 
		 A Kayes police report from January 1962 noted that: 
		  Those who have not yet been hired back are worried for their future. People believe that they will no longer receive their half-salary. They have no more confidence in the words of the Union and they invade the Government Ministries looking for work. Dissatisfaction reigns in their world and the reaction is that some will not wait to return to Senegal. (71)  
		 Other reactions included that Mali should discourage its citizens from returning to Senegal. '[T]his is serious,' the governor of Kayes wrote in the report's margins. (72) So serious, in fact, that some had already tried it. One cheminot returned to Senegal in February 1962 and submitted his application for Senegalese citizenship shortly thereafter, despite his expulsion from the country less than a year and a half before. '[I] only need to be naturalized to return to my work on the D.N. in Senegal,' he explained, treating his application as if it were a bureaucratic formality and alluding to a waiting job on the Dakar-Niger railway, which no longer existed. 'I did not have a job in Mali,' he added as a postscript. (73) Officials in Dakar picked up on this, deciding that 'his choice is only guided by the need to recover the job that he had left after 20 August'. (74) 
		 The threat of migration--by cheminots and others--made trains and railway stations important sites for the expression of state power (Rodet and County forthcoming). In 1961, the Senegalese government deemed rumours of Malian plans to demolish the railway tracks between Kayes and the border part of a hard-line policy meant to encourage Malians residing in Senegal to repatriate and isolate those who did not. (75) Indeed, when Senegal began a short-lived policy of requiring Malian travellers to have visas in late 1961, the US-RDA branch in Kayes suggested that the government suspend all train services with Senegal and transfer the railway's western terminus to Gouloumbo, 20 miles east of the border. (76) 
		 Despite the closure of the border until 1963, intermittent trade between the two countries continued via the road from Kayes (Lambert 1993:43). Neither government could reconfigure the region's long-standing migratory networks, as stated by Malian administrative reports that regularly denounced the circumvention of the border via Mauritania by Malian nationals attempting to reach Senegal. (77) State officials often cited train stations on the border and far beyond it as sites of anti-national activities such as emigration and smuggling. Memories of Senegal's break with the Federation lived on, underscoring the border's political threat and the problematic nature of train travel. '[I]n each train from "Katanga",' (78) local officials in Kayes complained in 1962, 'comrades come and go without luggage. These people deserve to be watched.' (79) Those most suspect were the ones coming from Senegal, 'foreigners' who brought dubious morals, economically unproductive enterprises, and political subversion. (80) To stop the flow of illegal importations from Senegal, the governor of Kayes made provisions for four members of the party's youth wing to ride the trains along 175 miles of track between Mahina and the border to prevent the movement of both smuggled goods and smugglers. (81) Even with heightened surveillance, officials throughout western Mali continued to see 'Malians flock to the station in order to continue to Senegal or France'. (82) 
		 In Kayes, the economic decline caused by the closed border with Senegal, its position at the far west of the country, and political disagreements with the central government and neighbouring administrative districts that stemmed from this distanced the city from the rest of the country. Tidiani Traore, a politician from Kayes, came under scrutiny from the US-RDA's radical wing in January 1961 after having decried the 'suffocation' faced by Kayes with the rail line closed. (83) Traore was denounced as a Senegalese agent, but the following month a joint meeting of government ministers swept the most serious charges aside, explaining: 'We can only reproach Tidiani for having spoken about reestablishing the railway between Mali and Senegal, even though the anger bom from the collapse of the Federation has not yet dissipated in us.' While admitting that support for re-establishing the railway did not necessarily mean collusion with Senegal, the Malian politicians were effectively acknowledging that the August 1960 plan to halt transborder railway services stung Mali more than Senegal. (84) Throughout the closed-border period, the railway question coloured all political discussion in Kayes. Senegalese intelligence reports from the summer of 1961 indicate that enormous pressure was being put on Modibo Keita to do something about re-establishing a rail link. Geographically and politically, people in Kayes felt isolated from the rest of the country. The city's financial affairs suffered so greatly that two wealthy merchants from the region proposed a plan in which Mali could solve its problems with the politically troublesome and administratively remote districts of Nioro and Kayes by transferring them to neighbouring Mauritania and Senegal. (85) National leaders worried that the growing number of public expressions of popular discontent in the region were tied to the government's inability to find employment for nearly half of the repatriated cheminots who had left Senegal, while further insisting that 'the regionalist attitude in Kayes must be denounced and combated'. (86) And, in Bafoulabe, Koli Sissoko scandalized 100 National Assembly deputies by saying that the district of Bafoulabe would be better off in Senegal. (87) Residents of Mali's westernmost cities grudgingly acknowledged the Senegalese assessment that Kayes was 'a state within the state' in Mali. (88) 
		 As the US-RDA tightened its control over Malian politics, overt challenges to authority were tolerated less and less. The number of secret police reports from this period testifies to the extent of the surveillance that Kayesian politics merited according to the central government. When the contents of one report were leaked to cheminots in the summer of 1962, police feared that the resulting public outcry over the practice would drive subversive political discussion further underground. (89) 
		 Even after reconciliation with Senegal in 1963, (90) authorities in Mali viewed railway travel with suspicion. While officials in Kayes said that relations between officials and civil servants in the Cercle were generally good, the head of the Ambidedi district believed that the town's stationmaster should be kept under close watch. (91) The local party branch complained that the customs service's request to halt all international passenger services at Ambidedi both undermined the city's functional role as an administrative centre and imposed an unnecessary burden on travel and communication between the westernmost towns along the railway and the rest of the country. (92) In a 1964 union meeting, one cheminot complained: 
		  The city of Toukoto ... is, for me and for many of my comrades, our primary residence. Four local customs agents in the train station spare no traveller in what they call the execution of their duty. They dig through all the luggage, registered or not, at arrival as well as at departure, no matter the destination or origin, be it within or beyond the borders of this country ... Thiemoko's widow ... coming from Bamako and still in mourning, was [a] victim of this abuse, much to the dismay of the people gathered around. (93)  
		 In 1965, a police officer reported that an old woman living in Kayes had been reported at the Diboli station before reaching Kidira. (94) She had woven amulets into her hair and had hidden within them the total sum of 30,010 Malian francs and 1,650 CFA francs. She had obtained a circulation permit from her son-in-law in order to travel from Kidira to Dakar. 
		 By 1967, trains and stations served as sites for a growing number of internecine conflicts between state institutions and branches of the US-RDA, particularly the party militia that assumed an even more important role after the national government inaugurated its socialist 'Active Revolution' in 1967. Just as customs agents had upset cheminots in 1964, militia bands upset customs agents as well as railway passengers by searching all trains from Bamako to the border and beyond, and relieving passengers of anything that they considered to be questionable. The railway administration did not like this because it upset their clients. And the general population worried that the militia was taking over the operations of certain state institutions such as the railway. (95) 
		 In March 1967, local US-RDA sections along the railway received a circular from Idrissa Diarra, the US-RDA national political secretary, warning them of a threat posed by a group of anonymous cheminots spreading political tracts and rumours that criticized the UNTM (Union nationale des travailleurs du Mali) (96) and the US-RDA and questioned the motives of politically active workers who defended either group. Such paranoia was not limited to the railway, but the railway presented a special problem because it 'brought into the open the real position of certain anti-party elements, camouflaged in the cheminots' ranks, who plan to create a climate of social disorder'. The subversive threat came from the cheminots' ability to relocate themselves all over the line, organize meetings and take advantage of their networks. Faced with such an egregious 'violation of our party's principles of sacrifice and patriotism', Diarra ordered local branches to keep watch on all travel and political activity in station towns. (97) Later that year, public speeches by union leaders at Mali's national cheminot conference all stressed the line's economic importance to the country and the related obligation that cheminots needed to address 'the need to reinforce unity within the union and ideological training for the workers on the rails in order to prevent the return of certain hidden anti-revolutionary activities which had cast doubt on the cheminots' revolutionary credentials and gravely compromised the railway's economic worth'. (98) While the central government clearly saw in some cheminots' actions a growing political threat and anti-national behaviour, one can wonder to what extent these were not just some of the few circumventing strategies adopted by long-standing diasporic communities along the railway in order to fight against top-down ascribed national identity and behaviours in an increasingly repressive political climate. 
		 Conclusion: a claim to translocal belonging along the railway 
		 Announcing the constitutive congress of the Republic of Mali's national union of railway workers on 26 September 1960, Mali's state radio lamented the unilateral treason of Senegalese leaders Dia and Senghor, whose desire to leave the Federation had torn apart a 'railway brotherhood woven together over so many decades'. (99) But the broadcast had more resonance in the world of politics than in the railway centres of the two new states. Indeed, the Senegalese maxim Kees-Kaay: benn dekk, haari gaar (Wolof: 'Thies and Kayes: one city with two train stations') held true: the ties between the countries proved stronger than the animosity between the states. Even the history of 19-20 August 1960 published by Senghor and Dia's government acknowledged the two countries' strong ties. The authors emphasized Sudanese responsibility for the Federation's collapse, while at the same time they insisted that the difference between the two countries was primarily political, counselling readers that Senegal would 'wait for tempers to calm' before talking to Keita's government: 'We refuse to cause irreparable damage to the Sudanese' (Republique du Senegal 1960: 30). If politicians in Bamako abandoned their dreams of restoring the Federation or punishing Senegal for leaving it, the Senegalese officials advised, then in Mali and in Senegal 'children and grandchildren can again take up our ties of friendship and brotherhood that exist between these two peoples so closely related [deux peuples freres]'. (100) 
		 Such ties were closest along the railway, including among people who, while not railway employees themselves, benefited economically and socially from the railway. Sitting in his home's courtyard across the tracks from the Mahina train station, Mamadou Diakite recalled his 'return' to the Republic of Mali as a move that was both unproblematic and fraught with danger. Born in Senegal to a cheminot from Mahina and the daughter of migrant farmers who left the Niger River valley to settle in Senegal's peanut basin, Diakite spent most of his first thirty years in Senegal but relocated to Mali in 1962 at the request of his repatriated father. Except for his midnight border crossing--when Senegalese guards alternately coaxed him back to the riverbank and shot at his truck--the voyage was uneventful. Arriving in Kayes, Diakite's father arranged for cheminot friends to ship him and the truck to the family home in Mahina. Over the next year, Diakite and his three brothers travelled between Mali, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire, driving the truck as a small-scale business, working in a series of odd jobs, and enduring the material and moral challenges that come with life away from home. 'Tumja man lambe Ion,' he said, repeating the Xaasonga adage that exile knows no dignity. Bandits preyed on travellers along Burkina Faso's roads and tales of sorcery and cannibalism terrified migrant farmhands in Cote d'Ivoire, but in Diakite's story, people in Mali and Senegal lived safe from these threats. This sense of tranquillity infused his whole narrative. As of 2009, all four brothers had settled between Mahina and Toukoto, and none of them strayed far from the line. The railway, Diakite explained, was their dignity: 'Anw ka danbe de don [It is our dignity].' (101) Having faced the privations of life abroad, the four Diakite brothers had chosen to guard their honour by staying close to the railway. 
		 Relocation along the tracks over generations engendered change within a socially and culturally acceptable continuum. Sissokos and Sakilibas (common Mande patronyms) moving from Sudan settled in Wolofophone western Senegal as Gueyes (Gueye is the Wolof equivalent of Sissoko and Sakiliba); Falls and Coulibalys could alternate their family names based on local linguistic practices, political considerations and personal inclinations. (102) In the colonial period, migrants from French Sudan and the upper Senegal River valley entered the administrative record having changed their Mande and Fulbe names to local Wolof forms (Pheffer 1975: 312). Some changed them back again during the Sudanese ascendency in Mali Federation politics (Foltz 1965: 149). And some changed only after being expelled from Senegal. Other migrants stubbornly refused to change. 'Beninese Keitas, Ivorian or Guinean Diops, Malian Gueyes' across the territory of the former French West Africa, and particularly across its now international borders, shaped diasporic communities, in some cases continuing to call Mali their 'homeland' despite never having visited the country of their ancestors (Keita 1983: 54). 
		 Anthropologist Bruce Whitehouse describes the Mande idea of 'dignity' (Bamana: danbe; Xaasonga: lambe) as a 'place-bound attribute, inextricably linked with local social hierarchies and family histories' (Whitehouse 2012: 21). Dignity is lost in exile because travellers move alone--or sometimes in groups away from the people who give shape to the hierarchies and away from societies where their histories have meaning. Another Mande proverb emphasizes the productive role of place in the concept of dignity. Woloyaro mayara be danbe dafa--a place to be bom and grow old brings dignity. Dignity is produced in space, and a dignified life can be lived only in this space (Bailleul 2005: 324). For cheminots railway workers as well as family members such as Diakite--'the railway' is a space produced by railway-specific conceptions of genealogy and administration, the perceptions of socially important work, and the rhythms of lived experience that were only possible with the comings and goings of the trains. With the collapse of the Mali Federation in 1960, these conceived, perceived and life spaces all clashed with hardening national cartographies. As Diakite suggested, exile knows no dignity, but some of these communities found their dignity in the railway as the backbone of their diasporic identity. Moving from Mali to Senegal was not an 'exile', nor was the reverse necessarily a 'return'. As long as the trains circulated, the international border only marked the difference between two states; it could not fundamentally disrupt the long-standing cultural continuum along the railway.

<titre>WRAPUP 8-Two die in police raid targeting suspected Paris attack mastermind</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Adds details of <mention id="1877">La Defense</mention> plot, victims of Paris attacks identified) 
		 * Two die, seven arrested in raid. Identities being checked 
		 * Investigators seeking alleged mastermind of Paris attacks 
		 * Group were planning to attack <mention id="1878">business district</mention> -sources
		* Some 33 Islamist State militants die in Syrian strikes 
		 By Antony Paone and Emmanuel Jarry 
		 SAINT DENIS, France, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and another militant died on Wednesday when police raided an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis seeking suspects in last week's attacks in the French capital. 
		 Three sources told Reuters the raid stopped a jihadist cell that had been planning an attack on <mention id="1879">Paris's business district</mention>, <mention id="1880">La Defense</mention>, after coordinated bombings and shootings killed 129 across the city. 
		 Officials said police had been hunting Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian Islamist militant accused of masterminding the Nov. 13 carnage, but more than nine hours after the launch of the pre-dawn raid it was still unclear if they had found him. 
		 Seven people were arrested in the operation, which started with a barrage of gunfire, including three people who were pulled from the apartment, officials said. 
		 "It is impossible to tell you who was arrested. We are in the process of verifying that. Everything will be done to determine who is who," Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said at the end of the operation. 
		 Molins said the assault was ordered after phone taps and surveillance operations led police to believe that Abaaoud might have been in St. Denis, near to the soccer stadium which was site of one of the attacks that hit Paris last week. 
		 Investigators believe the attacks -- the worst atrocity in France since World War Two -- was set in motion from Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St. Denis just before 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT). 
		 "We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake," said Sabrine, a downstairs neighbour from the apartment that was raided. 
		 She told Europe 1 radio that she heard the people above her talking to each other, running around and reloading their guns. 
		 Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion. 
		 "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up...," he told Reuters, without giving details. Three police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was also killed. 
		 FLEEING RAQQA 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the radicals and has launched three large air strikes on Raqqa -- the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria. 
		 Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224 people. 
		 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Wednesday the bombardments have killed at least 33 Islamic State militants over the past three days. 
		 Citing activists, the Observatory said Islamic State members and dozens of families of senior members had started fleeing Raqqa to relocate to Mosul in neighbouring Iraq. 
		 French prosecutors have identified five of the seven dead assailants from Friday - four Frenchmen and a man who was fingerprinted in Greece last month after arriving in the country via Turkey with a boatload of refugees fleeing the Syria war. 
		 Police believe two men directly involved in the assault subsequently escaped, including Salah Abdeslam, 26, a Belgian-based Frenchman who is accused of having played a central role in both planning and executing the deadly mission. 
		 French authorities said on Wednesday they had identified all the Nov. 13 victims. They came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. 
		 Until Wednesday morning, officials had said Abaaoud was in Syria. He grew up in Brussels, but media said he moved to Syria in 2014 to fight with Islamic State. Since then he has travelled back to Europe at least once and was involved in a series of planned attacks in Belgium foiled by the police last January. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters that the St. Denis cell was planning a fresh attack. "This new team was planning an attack on <mention id="1881">La Defense</mention>," one source said, referring to <mention id="1882">a high-rise neighbourhood on the outskirts of Paris that is home to top banks and businesses</mention>. 
		 A man in St. Denis told reporters that he had rented out the besieged apartment to two people last week. 
		 "Someone asked me a favour, I did them a favour. Someone asked me to put two people up for three days and I did them a favour, it's normal. I don't know where they came from I don't know anything," the man told Reuters Television. 
		 He was later arrested by police. 
		 AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Hollande is due to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington two days before that to push for a concerted drive against Islamic State. 
		 Obama said in Manila on Wednesday he wanted Moscow to shift its focus from propping up Syria's government to fighting the group and would discuss that with Putin. 
		 Russia is allied to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the West says he must go if there is to be a political solution to Syria's prolonged civil war. 
		 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Western nations had to drop their demands for Assad's exit if they wanted to build a coalition against Islamic State. 
		 But Hollande said countries should set aside their sometimes diverging national interests to battle their common foe. 
		 "The international community must rally around that spirit. I know very well that each country doesn't have the same interests," he told an assembly of city mayors on Wednesday. 
		 He confirmed that a French aircraft carrier group would set sail later in the day and head to the eastern Mediterranean to intensify the number of strikes on militant targets in Syria. Russia has said its navy will cooperate with this mission.

<titre>A first absolute chronology for Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age Myanmar: new AMS [sup.14]C dates from Nyaung'gan and Oakaie.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		10.15184/aqy.2018.66 Late prehistoric archaeological research in Myanmar is in a phase of rapid expansion. Recent work by the Mission Archeologique Francaise au Myanmar aims to establish a reliable Neolithic to Iron Age culture-historical sequence, which can then be compared to surrounding regions of Southeast Asia. Excavations at Nyaung'gan and Oakaie in central Myanmar have provided 52 new AMS dates, which allow the creation of Myanmars first reliable prehistoric radiometric chronology. They have also identified the Neolithic to Bronze Age transition in central Myanmar, which is of critical importance in understanding long-range interactions at the national, regional and inter-regional level. This research provides the first significant step towards placing late prehistoric Myanmar in its global context. Keywords: Southeast Asia, Myanmar, Late Neolithic, Bronze Age
		Introduction 
		 Myanmars location makes it pivotal to tracing cultural, genetic, linguistic and technological links between South, East and Southeast Asia. Investigations of its prehistory, however, are in their infancy, with virtually no sites investigated in the uppermost and lowermost thirds of the country. Even the more intensively studied central area lacks a coherent culture-historical sequence until the appearance of the Pyu city-states in the early centuries AD. Recent research in archaeology and related disciplines in Thailand and Vietnam has fundamentally advanced our understanding of the Neolithic and Bronze Age transitions in Mainland Southeast Asia, both of them thought to be linked to migrations and/or stimuli from present-day China. Of the approximately 2500km-long border between China and the continental Association of Southeast Asian Nations states (ASEAN), approximately 1600km is with Myanmar. Characterising Myanmars Neolithic and Bronze Age periods may therefore offer important complementary information to that obtained from its eastern neighbours---perhaps identifying additional routes, timings and mechanisms of biological and/or cultural transmission. This paper lays out chronological building blocks from our investigation of two sites in central Myanmar: Nyaung'gan and Oakaie (Figure 1). 
		 Since excavations of the cemetery at Nyaung'gan in 1998-1999, the site has been virtually synonymous with Myanmars late prehistoric period. Relative dating of grave goods associated with the 43 excavated burials attributed the cemetery to the Bronze Age--the first site of this date to be found in Myanmar (Moore &amp; Pauk 2001; Tayles et al. 2001). No charcoal was recovered, and the radiocarbon dating of human remains failed due to a lack of extractable collagen (using late 1990s techniques). The major aims of the Franco-Myanmar project were to provide an absolute chronology for Nyaung'gan and the surrounding area, and to contribute towards a national culture-historical framework and comparative bioarchaeological, material culture and environmental data for Thailand's and Vietnams rich archaeological datasets, as well as those being developed in Cambodia and Laos. This paper addresses the first and essential issue--the chronology. 
		 Archaeological sites 
		 Nyaung'gan is located 10km north-east of the Chindwin River, on the edge of a Cenozoic volcanic crater (95.0600[degrees] east, 22.4110[degrees] north). The environment is semi-arid, averaging 675mm of rainfall per annum. Modern, active copper mines 30km to the south (Maung Maung Khin et al. 1970) were previously assumed relevant to Nyaung'gan's Bronze Age phase (Moore &amp; Pauk 2001: 37-38) (Figure 1). The Franco-Myanmar project began by investigating the extensive ceramic and lithic surface scatters south of the modern village of Oakaie. Ten excavations at four different loci with a combined surface area of 348[m.sup.2] were conducted over three seasons. These revealed mortuary, occupation and industrial evidence. 
		 The OAI1 cemetery was partially exposed during two contiguous excavations in 2014 (80[m.sup.2]) and 2015 (105[m.sup.2]). Forty single and six multiple burials of adults--both males and females--and sub-adults were cut into a sterile volcanic tuff at varying depths and at orientations that suggest at least two and possibly three phases of use (Figure 2). Funerary offerings included bivalve shells, pottery, stone beads and bracelets, bone bracelets, shell beads, spindle whorls, a cowrie shell and a dog burial. A single bronze axe was found in Si5, an upper level burial. Due to complex grave intercutting, superpositioning and recent disturbance, it is currently impossible to attribute definitively OAI1 burials devoid of metal to the Bronze Age or preceding periods (cf. Pryce 2015). Twenty radiocarbon dates from O All have been obtained from human bone, human tooth enamel and bivalve shell. 
		 OAI2 is a settlement area centred around 95.0420[degrees] east, 22.3905[degrees] north, approximately 750m west of OAI1. Excavation here aimed to provide a wide area perspective of habitation deposits containing domestic and industrial material culture. All five excavation squares, totalling 114[m.sup.2], revealed a dense, sherd-packed, 300-500mm-thick occupation deposit, representing two phases according to ceramic analysis. Postholes were numerous, as were lithic debitage and artefacts, animal bone and flecks of copper-base corrosion products. A single adult male inhumation was found, as well as seven under-floor infant jar burials, one of which contained two stone bracelets (Figure 3). Eight radiocarbon dates from OAI2 have been obtained from human bone, human tooth enamel and charcoal. 
		 OAI3 is located approximately 200m south-west of OAI2, at 95.0403[degrees] east, 22.3893[degrees] north. The aim in excavating OAI3 in 2016 was to explore the sequence of occupation, as opposed to the horizontal variation identified at OAI2. Six cultural layers were found above the sterile layer at a depth of 2.1m (Figure 4). The first cultural layer below plough soil comprised a dark brown soil matrix with numerous postholes and large quantities of ceramics, lithics, animal bone, nine copper-base fragments and a single infant jar burial. The intact domestic deposits were extremely dense, representing floors or middens, and one feature had been heated sufficiently to cause some ceramics to deform. Lithics were present as finished and near-finished adzes, beads, bracelets, grindstones and hammer stones, as well as related debitage. A single bloated and vitrified copper-stained crucible fragment was found in the first layer (Pryce et al. 2017). The third layer consisted of a lighter brown matrix that contained similar but fewer features and material than the second cultural layer, except for the complete absence of copper-base artefacts. The interface of the third and fourth layers consisted of a well-defined floor surface covered with horizontally aligned ceramic fragments. Beneath this was a 200-500mm-thick deposit with fewer artefacts and a near absence of lithic tools or debitage. The boundary between the fourth and fifth layers sloped to the south-east and was followed by 200-650mm of a dark brown matrix containing some ceramic fragments, but far fewer cut features than the second and third cultural layers. The sixth layer comprised a light-coloured, hard volcanic tuff, as per the sterile seventh layer, but containing very few ceramic sherds. Seven charcoal radiocarbon determinations were obtained from the upper metal-bearing phase, and eight from lower contexts devoid of metal artefacts. 
		 OAI4 was a settlement and industrial site at 95.0465[degrees] east, 22.3955[degrees] north, approximately 950m north-east of OAI3. Excavation in 2016 revealed two cultural layers 700-850mm in depth. Compared to OAI3, the density of material was far lower than expected, given the plough soil rich in lithics, animal bone and ceramics. A sterile volcanic tuff was encountered at a depth of 850-1000mm. Further excavation 50m to the southeast encountered two undisturbed cultural deposits beneath the plough soil. The upper phase was 300mm-thick and the second, lighter in colour, was 600mm thick, with gravel inclusions. Both layers contained lithics (artefacts and production debris), animal bone and ceramics, the latter having morpho-stylistic differences between phases comparable to those at OAI2 and 3. Two charcoal radiocarbon determinations come from the upper phase and one from the lower phase. 
		 We view the four excavated loci, OAI1-4, as components of one settlement. This is supported by an intensive systematic pedestrian survey of the type developed in the Eastern Mediterranean and Mesoamerica, and previously tested in Thailand (Banning 2002; Bevan &amp; Conolly 2004; Pryce et al. 2011). Two square kilometres covering all four loci were walked with a spacing of 20m. All artefacts were recorded and collected every 10m, and subsequently assessed by the project's find specialists. The presence of prehistoric material decreased towards the east, but no significant attenuation was found to the north, south or west. Current data suggest the surface area of this late prehistoric site to be at least 1k[m.sup.2], which is exceptionally large for Southeast Asia. 
		 Nyaung'gan 
		 As the 1998-1999 excavations at Nyaung'gan were intended to provide a site museum, the uppermost burials and their grave goods were partially exposed and then pedestalled for ease of viewing. This permitted wide exposure of the archaeology but limited diachronic perspective. Our 2016 excavations investigated the full time-depth of the cemetery, and recorded and removed each burial. Targeting the highest extant ground surface within the cemetery, a 4 x 4m square trench (NYG1) was placed between former trenches 4 and 5 (Figure 5). Two burials--Si and 2--oriented north were found at a depth of 0.5m, accompanied by pottery vessels. Three layers could be distinguished stratigraphically, but due to the friable ashy fill, it was not possible to identify the grave cuts (Figure 6). A further 4 x 4m square (NYG2) was placed 12m to the south, in which three individuals were exposed (Figure 7). The first, S3a, was represented only by a skull and had disturbed S3b, a previous burial, immediately below. S3b was oriented north-north-west and was associated with a dog burial, and funerary deposits including a turtle, a bone bracelet, stone beads and pottery. The third burial, S4, was oriented north-west and also incorporated pottery grave goods. All burials were found approximately 0.8m below the current ground surface, but no grave cuts could be identified. [C] Antiquity Publications Ltd, 2018 
		 A final trench (NYG3) covering 2 x 11m was placed immediately adjacent to test pit 1 from 1998-1999, which had produced the majority of the copper-base artefacts. The upper layer, approximately 100mm thick, was highly disturbed and yielded a single leadedcopper arrowhead or spearhead. While its context is not secure, we have assumed, based on the absence of later period sites in the area, that it does relate to the Bronze Age cemetery (Pryce et al. 2017). A highly disturbed burial--S5--was found in NYG3 just below the current ground surface in the western part of the excavation. Towards the centre, one individual--S6--was found at approximately 0.4m below the current ground surface, oriented north-west, and accompanied by pottery vessels, a cattle skull and ribs, and stone beads. The final individual--S7--oriented north-north-west, was uncovered below S6, and was accompanied by pottery vessels and stone beads (Figure 8). 
		 Ceramic techno-typology 
		 The methodology applied to the Oakaie and Nyaung'gan ceramic assemblages from the 2014-2016 excavation and survey seasons relies on the concept of the chaine operatoire and its application as a descriptive and analytical tool to every sherd recovered (Roux &amp; Courty 1998, 2007; Roux 2010, 2016). Most of the pottery analysed, whether from funerary or settlement contexts, belongs to the same technical tradition: roughed-out using coils and discontinuous pressure, followed by shaping with paddle and anvil for medium and large closed forms. As such, we consider that there was social continuity in the population during the period in question, with the differences in the ceramic assemblage limited almost exclusively to morphometry and decoration. 
		 These differences allow us to identify two main phases (Figure 9). The youngest of these is the copper-/bronze-bearing level at OAI1, currently only represented with certainty by individual S15, the burials excavated at Nyaung'gan in 1998-1999 and 2016's upper level burials S1 and S6. This phase is also represented by large paddled and impressed burial jars in the upper copper-/bronze-bearing layers at OAI2 and 3. The second phase, which sees a significant drop in the proportion of decorated wares, is represented in the 2016 season's burials S2, S3b, S4 and S7 at Nyaung'gan, and the non-copper-/bronze-bearing layers at the occupation/industrial sites OAI24. It is possible that OAI3's layers 4-6 represent an even older phase. Likewise, pottery from OAI1 burials devoid of metal could potentially be differentiated on the criteria of carination and paddle-impressed decoration, but we currently lack chronostratigraphic resolution for this cemetery. 
		 Chronology 
		 The Franco-Myanmar team's 52 new radiocarbon determinations allow us to provide some absolute dating for what has been a critical chronological lacuna for over 20 years, not only for the Nyaung'gan area, but also for central Myanmar and the country as a whole (Pryce et al. 2015). Radiocarbon (AMS) dating was performed at a number of laboratories in the UK, France, the USA and New Zealand, using their respective methodologies (Brock et al. 2010; Hoper et al. 2015; Dumoulin et al. 2017). The combined dataset was calibrated using OxCal v4.24 (Tables S1-5, see online supplementary material (OSM); Bronk Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2013). Our radiocarbon methodology is not without issues and we were obliged to experiment substantially. Despite archaeobotanical flotation of grave fills, stomach cavities and pot contents, we were unable to recover any charcoal from mortuary contexts. Following unsuccessful attempts to extract collagen from 13 OAI1 femur samples, five of these samples were re-submitted for bone apatite dating, including SI 5--the only grave containing a copper-base artefact. In 2015, teeth and ribs from OAI1 and OAI2 burials were sampled for apatite dating. These determinations, which were all successful apart from the tooth in OAI1/S29, indicated that the ribs were consistently more susceptible to post-depositional diagenesis and that the teeth gave more reliable dates. All of our apatite dates, however, risk being young--as is often the case (Zazzo 2014)---and we use them cautiously. 
		 Eight bivalve shells found in association with OAI1 burials were also dated. This approach was used with great success in Thailand using freshwater species (Higham &amp; Higham 2009). We have thus far been unable to identify the shell species, but some of the dates are suspiciously early (in particular OAI1/S26 &amp; S45). This may be due to species-specific marine or freshwater reservoir effects. Until there is full identification of shell species, we are likewise inclined to discount these dates (Table SI, OSM). Flotation provided numerous charcoal samples from OAI2-4, and teeth samples were taken from the adult burial at OAI2, as well as at NYG1-3 (Tables S2-5, OSM). As per OAI1, the NYG enamel apatite dated later than was expected for burials assigned stratigraphically and from material-culture to the Neolithic (S2-5 &amp; S7), and was indistinguishable indeed from those burials ascribed to the Bronze Age (SI &amp; S6), with all of them falling in the ninth to fifth centuries BC at two standard deviations. We note that the NYG 1-3 matrices of friable volcanic ash would have allowed for easy passage of water, thereby increasing the risk of diagenesis. Due to these issues, we rely heavily upon the charcoal dates (notwithstanding the old wood effect') and use dates derived from other materials as relative guidance at present. 
		 While the [sup.14]C determinations provide the numbers, it is their combination with the stratigraphic, bioarchaeological and particularly the ceramic data that provide the framework for our chronological reconstruction of the late prehistoric Nyaung'gan/Oakaie area. The excavation of OAI3 was especially critical, as our strategy was to achieve maximum depth, rather than the large open area exposure as at OAI2. The absence of metal in layer 3 and below at OAI3 implies that the majority of the deposit was potentially 'Neolithic', and only the upper 300-400mm were Bronze Age sensu stricto. Ceramic analysis also indicated a clear shift from proportionally less to more decoration in the OAI3 Neolithic to Bronze Age layer transition, a distinction also seen at OAI2 and OAI4. 
		 But what of the cemeteries? OAI1's sole metal-bearing burial, S15, cuts burial Si8 and has a ceramic assemblage highly comparable to those from the 1998-1999 excavations at Nyaung'gan, as well as NYG3/S6. In particular, a large paddle-impressed jar found in OAI1/S15 is very similar to those used for underfloor infant burials in metal-bearing levels at OAI2 and OAI3, as well as one found during the excavation of OAI1/S9. This was probably invasive, as its placement destroyed the individual's lower limbs. We thus consider it reasonable to interpret OAI1/S15 as representing Early Bronze Age burial activity, despite its later first-millennium BC bone apatite direct date (Table S2, OSM). Intercutting, superpositioning and pottery assemblages at OAI1 strongly suggest that there is at least one, and possibly two, burial phases prior to that of S15. Not only do all these burials lack metal, but from extrapolation from OAI2-4 using pottery techno-typologies, it is probable that a large proportion are Neolithic. 
		 At Nyaung'gan, the bronze-bearing burials excavated in 1998-1999 have comparable pottery assemblages to individuals NYGl/Sl and NYG3/S6 excavated in 2016. In NYG3, S6 superposes S7, which has a similar pottery assemblage to individuals S2, S3b and S4 (S3a and S5 were incomplete and disturbed burials, respectively), suggesting that these metal-less burials are also potentially Neolithic. The relation between these older burials and the lower-level burials at OAI1 is not yet clear. We recognise that our Neolithic burials at Nyaung'gan and Oakaie 1 all have direct [sup.14]C dates that are regionally unacceptably late, but given the complementary ceramic and stratigraphic evidence, we are inclined to attribute this discrepancy to elevated apatite diagenesis (Table S5, OSM). The Neolithic and Bronze Age phases evidenced at Nyaung'gan and Oakaie 1 were probably not widely separated in time. 
		 Discussion and conclusion 
		 To make sense of our local chronology we have leant upon the relatively secure charcoal dating from the settlement/industrial sites--which may suffer from the 'old wood' effect-- and extrapolated them to the cemeteries, as described above, to support the teeth and bone apatite dates, which are probably artificially young. As such, a precise date for the debut of the Bronze Age in the Nyaung'gan area cannot yet be assigned. Figure 10, however, shows that a line plotted between charcoal dates attributed to copper-/bronze-bearing and copper/bronze-devoid phases indicates a transition during the tenth to ninth centuries BC. For the copper-/bronze-devoid phase, the lack of incised and impressed ('i&amp;i') pottery generally considered typical of the initial Mainland Southeast Asian Neolithic is notable (Rispoli 2007; Chi &amp; Hung 2010). Concomitantly with the earliest [sup.14]C charcoal determinations in which we have confidence dating only to the thirteenth to twelfth centuries BC, it is clear that the investigated area is, at the oldest, Late/Terminal Neolithic. Thus, our 
		 Caption: Figure 10. Charcoal radiocarbon determinations from OAI2-4 settlement industrial sites, metal-bearing vs metal- devoid layers clearly identified at OAI2 and OAI3, showing the c. 1000 BC Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age transition. Determinations for OAI3 contexts 30054, 30060 and 30061 are considered suspect, but we present full data. entire local chronology can be constrained between the thirteenth to eighth centuries BC (or 600 years) at a maximum, and probably significantly less, in the order of 400500 years. As there is no indication of Iron Age or historical-era activity in the area, the question remains as to why the Nyaung'gan/Oakaie sites were abandoned by the mid first millennium BC. 
		 No other Bronze Age culture area in Myanmar has been dated radiometrically, hence comparisons at the national scale are not yet possible. Excavations at Halin, approximately 80km east of Nyaung'gan, and Ywa Gon Gyi, approximately 100km south of Mandalay (Pautreau et al. 2010; Hudson &amp; Nyein Lwin 2012), however, are claimed to have yielded examples of the 'i&amp;i' pottery characteristic of early Mainland Southeast Asian immigrant farming populations, in association with a total of five radiocarbon dates. The three Halin dates fall in the early to mid third millennium BC, while the two from Ywa Gon Gyi fall in the mid to late third and early to mid second millennia BC respectively. We have not been able to examine the ceramic samples to check the 'i&amp;i' claims, but note that four of the five dates offered (the exception being the youngest Ywa Gon Gyi date, on burnt animal bone) (Pautreau et al. 2010), are significantly older than those currently accepted for the debut of the Mainland Southeast Asian Neolithic, at c. 2000-1800 BC (Higham et al. 2011a; Oxenham et al. 2011). 
		 The Nyaung'gan/Oakaie chronology presented above documents the transition to copper-base metallurgy rather than the introduction of the first agricultural practices, and it is appropriate to compare this with the few other reliably dated regional sequences. The sites in question--Ban Chiang, Ban Lum Khao, Ban Non Wat, Non Nok Tha, Non Pa Wai and Tha Kae--are all located in central and north-east Thailand (Figure 1) and have recently been subjected to a comprehensive radiocarbon dating or re-dating programme to establish an authoritative late prehistoric cultural sequence (Higham &amp; Higham 2009; Higham et al. 2011b, 2014, 2015; Rispoli et al. 2013; Higham &amp; Rispoli 2014). The necessity for this effort derives from controversial claims made in the 1960s and 1970s concerning a fourth-millennium BC (Bronze Age) designation for contexts at the Ban Chiang and Non Nok Tha sites (e.g. Solheim 1968; Bayard 1972). While substantial chronological revisions have been subsequently proposed (e.g. White 1988, 2008), there remained until recently a division in opinion between those who advocated a 'Long Chronology Model (LCM)' with copper-base metallurgy appearing in the early second millennium BC, and those proposing a 'Short Chronology Model (SCM)', with a late second-millennium BC Bronze Age transition. The difference between these positions was not merely chronological but also concerned the mechanism of cultural transmission from or via present-day China. The LCM advocates metal-using migrants from north-west China, while the SCM proposes a 'trade and exchange' model with the Chinese Central Plains and the south-east (Pigott &amp; Ciarla 2007; White &amp; Hamilton 2009; Higham et al. 2011b). 
		 Higham et al.'s (2015) new dating programme has established that a thirteenth- to tenth-century BC Bronze Age transition occurred in central and north-eastern Thailand. These results are supported by technological and geochemical studies of contemporary metal production and consumption behaviours (Pryce et al. 2010, 2014). At present, there are no reliable data for Laos, and the chronology for northern Vietnam remains unclear (Oxenham 2015). But what of Myanmars pivotal geographic position, with regard to the diachronic movement of people, materials and culture over its long terrestrial borders with South and East Asia? 
		 There is, of course, no reason why Myanmars late prehistoric chronology should exactly match that proposed by Higham et al. (2015) for Thailand. Indeed, our objectives at Nyaung'gan/Oakaie specifically included searching out variation in regional and interregional cultural transmission. We note that although a stimulus for the Bronze Age of Myanmar could have come from the second-millennium BC northern Indian Copper Hoard Culture (Coningham &amp; Young 2015), there is a dearth of evidence for making such an argument east of Bengal. Similarly, the late prehistoric chronology of the mountainous Yunnan province in China is relatively poorly understood compared to Guangxi and Guangdong (Ciarla 2007), and thus a direct transmission from south-west China remains possible. It is remarkable, however, that the Neolithic to Bronze Age transition of the tenth to ninth centuries BC proposed for central Myanmar should be so consistent with the Thai evidence, which falls perhaps only 100-300 years older. It should also be noted that at Ban Non Wat, incised and impressed ceramics were absent from later Neolithic contexts (Higham &amp; Higham 2009), which seemingly mirrors the situation at Nyaung'gan/Oakaie. Furthermore, the archaeometallurgical evidence itself is highly suggestive of a strong connection with Myanmars eastern neighbours, and thus the SCM. From the very outset of central Myanmars Bronze Age, copper and bronze artefacts with lead isotope signatures consistent with copper production at Non Pa Wai in central Thailand and the Vilabouly Complex in central Laos were appearing in Nyaung'gan/Oakaie area deposits. This is in addition to as yet unidentified sources that do not correspond to the Monywa mineralisation (Pryce et al. 2017). This implies that the exchange networks necessary for the transport of copper-base raw materials or finished products to central Myanmar over more than 1000 geodesic kilometres, and thus far longer following suitable river valleys, mountain passes or coastal routes, were active within several generations of the Thai Bronze Age transition, if indeed they were not already active for other materials or population movements. 
		 Many of the specialist studies (e.g. archaeobotany, bioarchaeology (archaeothanatology, strontium isotopes, dietary stable isotopes, aDNA), lithic analysis and archaeozoology) for Nyaung'gan and Oakaie are ongoing, and thus more detail will be forthcoming. With what we argue to be the beginnings of a reliable chronology in place, we can nevertheless be reasonably certain that this area presents evidence of late second-/early first-millennium BC activity at a scale practically unknown in Southeast Asia, and a late prehistoric trajectory intimately intertwined with its eastern neighbours. The pressing need is to detect the transition to agriculture in central Myanmar. The Franco-Myanmar team is currently attempting this with excavations of suspected Early Neolithic through to historic Pyu deposits at the UNESCO-listed site of Halin (Figure 1). We thus hope to advance the national culture-historical sequence for late prehistory and to enrich regional syntheses.

<titre>Paris property benefits from Brexit bounce</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		As the UK's exit from the EU approaches, and many of London's leading financial institutions look to Paris for their relocation plans, agents in the city are enjoying a Brexit bounce. Currently, 14 major financial services firms - most of them investment banks - have confirmed staff moves to Paris or plans to open a subsidiary, meaning that 2,000 jobs are set to move from London to Paris or be newly created in Paris, according to PwC. 
		 Home Hunts, which finds French properties for affluent international buyers, had 342 inquiries from UK customers for Paris homes in the first half of this year, more than double the 165 it received in the same period in 2017.
		"A good number are London-based, working in finance and are buying as an investment, with the view that it could become a more permanent home if they are relocated," says Tim Swannie of Home Hunts. "They are seeking a base in Paris as a hedge against [an unfavourable] Brexit outcome," says Edward de Mallet Morgan at Knight Frank. 
		 The Brexit bounce is only half the story, however. Inquiries to Home Hunts from Middle Eastern buyers - mainly those from UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia - increased from 90 in the first six months of 2017 to just under 200 in the first half of 2018. Some of this is because of buyers deserting London for a more reliable European base. But the growing demand for top-end homes from this region is also driven by the recovering oil price, with buyers from the region favouring the French capital for its history, culture and reputation for high fashion. 
		 Whatever the cause, two years after the Brexit vote - from the third quarter of 2016, to the third quarter of this year - prime property prices in Paris had risen 17.5 per cent, according to Knight Frank. In the three months to September 2018, prices jumped 2.7 per cent.  
		 Avenue Foch in the 16th arrondissement is the must-have destination for the truly minted from countries like Saudi Arabia or Qatar, says De Mallet Morgan: the street, which branches off from the Arc de Triomphe, contains some of the largest homes to be found in any European city, he says. The 16th arrondissement adjoins the Bois de Boulogne and is close to <mention id="1885">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1886">Paris's business district</mention>. The most sought after spots are the northern reaches around Trocadéro, says Gabriel Malassis of Agence Varenne, a Savills associate. "This area offers the remarkable Haussmann properties, often with views over Paris but also private mansions and houses with gardens." 
		 On Rue Charles Lamoureux, Christie's International Real Estate is selling a grand, four-bedroom apartment with high ceilings for€4.05m. Just over the Avenue de la Grande-Armée, in the 17th arrondissement, Knight Frank is selling a two-bedroom apartment for€2.275m. 
		 Swannie's buyers - many of whom are financial workers favouring the short commute to <mention id="1887">La Défense</mention> - are shopping for two or three-bedroom apartments in Haussmann-designed buildings with a caretaker. In the 16th, a short stroll from the Arc de Triomphe, Home Hunts is selling an 1850s townhouse with six bedrooms for€10.3m. 
		 The 6th and 7th arrondissements - which house many of the city's most famous landmarks - are popular top-end spots too, says Swannie. 
		 Aside from the Brexit vote, most agents attribute the recent price gains to the election of Emmanuel Macron last May and the more welcoming tax regime that it has signalled. Particularly influential has been the January replacement of France's wealth tax with an equivalent annual levy focused exclusively on property. 
		 For French residents the previous tax had been raised on all worldwide assets over a value of€1.3m, from homes - including those owned abroad - and yachts to financial investments, cars and jewellery. Non-French residents faced an equivalent tax on all assets they held in France over the same amount. With the new tax now restricted to property (and excluding the portion owned through a mortgage) rich French expats who fled under previous president François Hollande are returning home in increasing numbers, say agents. 
		 More recently, French authorities have dangled tax breaks in front of London bankers. A UK expat in France with an annual income of€1m including allowances could take home more than€180,000 more than she would in the UK, according to research by PwC for the FT. 
		 As Brexit approaches, the city will continue to benefit from the uncertainty surrounding London's finance sector. Even with "modest Brexit relocations" the sector is set to grow at 2 per cent per year, according to Richard Holt of Oxford Economics in London. "If there are further pro-business reforms, then given the city's huge business and cultural assets, Paris could become a big rival to London."

		ENPNewswire-September 10, 2019--Dexia Group consolidated results H1 20191 Acceleration of the Group's transformation 
		 (C)2019 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 09092019 - Dexia's Total Capital ratio at 25.3% as at the end of June 2019, against 27.3% as at 31 December 2018. 
		 Wouter Devriendt, CEO of Dexia, stated: 'The first half of 2019 saw a significant acceleration in the Group's transformation. The achievements are remarkable and the result of tremendous teamwork. Under favourable market conditions, particularly in the United States, we exceeded our objectives of reducing commercial portfolios, continuing to reduce risks and our geographical footprint. Indeed, we finalised the sale of our German subsidiary Dexia Kommunalbank Deutschland, closed our Madrid branch and began the transformation of our New York branch. We also continued and accelerated our asset disposal programme, which resulted in the sale of almost EUR 7 billion in assets.
		I would like to thank the Group's employees most sincerely for having been so tireless in their efforts to make these achievements possible.' Gilles Denoyel, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dexia, said: 'During the first half of 2019, we accelerated the implementation of our roadmap by anticipating the execution of several strategic objectives. All stakeholders are actively involved in the Group's orderly resolution. Indeed, in May and then in July the Board of Directors approved two ambitious asset disposal programmes, the execution of which is already underway. The Belgian and French States set the process in motion with a view to renewing Dexia's funding guarantee beyond 31 December 2021 and negotiations with the European Commission are going well, a response expected in the coming weeks. Once again, I would like to acknowledge the important work accomplished by management and teams over the past few months.'

		 Introduction 
		 Since its entry into orderly resolution, Dexia has been implementing a proactive strategy to reduce its activities and the Group's balance sheet. The first half of 2019 represents an important step in this dynamic, due in particular to the completion of the sale of Dexia Kommunalbank Deutschland (DKD), its banking subsidiary in Germany, the closure of DCL Madrid and the launch of the transformation of the American branch of Dexia Credit Local (DCL New York). In addition, the Group maintained good momentum in the sale of its commercial asset portfolios and took, in May and then in July, structuring decisions on two new disposal programmes. 
		 The Group took advantage of favourable market conditions, in particular in the United States, to implement this strategy. In this highly volatile environment, the Group continues to seek all measures to simplify and reduce risks. 
		 In accordance with the legislation in force, for the period ending 30 June 2019, Dexia is publishing a press release relating to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Dexia's 2019 half-yearly financial report will be published in full on 11 September 2019. 
		 1. Significant events and transactions 
		 Dynamic strategy to reduce the balance sheet and risks 
		 Disposal of DKD and simplification of the international network: closure of DCL Madrid and launch of the transformation of DCL New York 
		 A. Balance sheet reduction and simplification of the Group structure 
		 Asset portfolio reduction 
		 Other than the sale of DKD, at the end of June 2019, the asset portfolios were down by EUR 5.8 billion compared to the end of December 2018, including EUR 3.8 billion in disposals, EUR 0.4 billion in early redemptions and EUR 1.6 billion in natural amortisation. The proportion of assets denominated in non-euro currencies is significant and amounts to 75% of total sales over the half-year. 
		 As part of DCL New York's transformation and in order to facilitate the transfer of the entity's balance sheet to the head office of Dexia Credit Local in Paris, the Board of Directors decided to sell a significant portfolio of assets held by that branch (cf. the section 'Transformation of the Dexia Credit Local Branch in New York'). 
		 Market dynamics in the United States made it possible to implement this decision under favourable conditions. During the half-year, Dexia sold EUR 2.4 billion of US assets, with an impact of EUR -89 million on the Group's result. The assets sold include the entire ABS student loan portfolio (EUR 1.1 billion) as well as public sector assets (EUR 1.3 billion). 
		 On 5 September 2019, the amount of sales amounted to EUR 6.7 billion, of which EUR 5.0 billion of US assets. The Group also reached an agreement for the sale of almost all of its exposure to the Chicago Board of Education. 
		 The Group also continued its proactive disposal of other asset classes. 
		 In addition, on 19 July 2019, the Board of Directors approved the implementation of a second asset disposal programme. This programme falls within the framework of changes to and strengthening of the regulatory requirements applicable to the Group (cf. the section 'Strengthening of the prudential requirements') and reflects a prudent approach to risk management. In particular, it targets sales, which will enable Dexia to reduce its exposure to market risk, including liquidity risk, while preserving its solvency position. 
		 These two strategic decisions taken by the Board of Directors result in a change in the business model applicable to the selected portfolios. The assets concerned, which had been classified at amortised cost at the time of the first application of IFRS 9, will be reclassified at fair value through profit or loss (FVP&amp;L) or Dexia S.A. - Place du Champ de Mars 5, B-1050 Bruxelles - 1, Passerelle des Reflets, <mention id="1889">Paris-La Defense</mention> 2, F-92919 La Defense Cedex 3 fair value through equity (FVOCI) on 1 July 2019 for the US asset portfolio and on 1 January 2020 for the second portfolio respectively. 
		 The disposals planned within the framework of these two plans will in time reduce Dexi'as credit risk exposure and its balance sheet sensitivity, although in the meantime the reclassification of those assets in fair value will expose Dexia to changes in macroeconomic conditions. 
		 Closure of Dexia Credit Local Madrid 
		 Following the restructuring undertaken in 2016 and the transfer of all assets to Dexia Credit Local head office in Paris in 2018, Dexia definitively closed the Madrid branch on 29 March 2019. 
		 Finalisation of the sale of DKD to Helaba On 1 May 2019, after obtaining all the regulatory authorisations, Dexia concluded the sale of DKD to Helaba for a total amount of EUR 352 million. 
		 For Dexia, this transaction is reflected by a EUR 24.4 billion reduction of its balance sheet total. The net impact of the sale on the statement of income amounts to EUR -115 million, but the impact on the Group's solvency ratios is slightly positive and amounts to 15 basis points. These impacts have been booked in the Dexia consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 2019. 
		 Dexia Credit Local has terminated the letters of support granted to DKD, with effect as at the date of conclusion of the sale. 
		 DKD now operates under the name of KOFIBA-Kommunalfinanzierungsbank GmbH. 
		 Transformation of the Dexia Credit Local branch in New York At the beginning of 2019, Dexia Credit Local began implementing the transformation of its New York branch. 
		 This project, which is within the framework of the Group's process of reducing its geographical footprint and simplifying operations, has three components: The transfer to Dexia Credit Local's Paris head office of the portfolios of assets, funding and derivatives related to these operations. This transfer is planned for 1 October 2019; The centralisation of management processes currently under the responsibility of Dexia Credit Local New York; The transformation, during the first half of 2020, of Dexia Credit Local New York as a representative office. 
		 In order to facilitate the transfer of asset portfolios and to reduce the operational risk associated with such transfer, Dexia initiated a programme of US asset disposals, which should continue throughout 2019 (cf. the section 'Asset portfolio reduction').

		 B. Strengthening of prudential requirements 
		 As previsously stated 2 , since the start of 2019 Dexia has no longer benefited from the approach to supervision which had applied to the Group since 2015. 
		 Furthermore, on 14 February 20193 , the ECB informed the Dexia Group of the qualitative and quantitative prudential requirements with regard to solvency applicable to Dexia SA and its subsidiaries as from 1 March 2019, in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 dated 15 October 2013. These requirements rely in particular on the conclusions drawn from the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). 
		 C. Evolution of Group governance 
		 On 25 February 2019, the Dexia Board of Directors appointed Patrick Renouvin who succeeded Aline Bec as Dexia's Chief Operating Officer as from 1 May 2019. 
		 Patrick Renouvin has sound experience, acquired in particular with the Banque Postale, of which he was a member of the Management Board and Head of the Solutions unit (information technologies, payments, organisation). He has also held various posts with Societe Generale and worked in consultancy firms. 
		 On 4 February 2019, the Dexia Board of Directors appointed Claire Cheremetinski as a non-executive director of Dexia, replacing Lucie Muniesa. 
		 On 21 March 2019, the Dexia Board of Directors appointed Tamar Joulia-Paris as a non-executive director of Dexia as from 22 April 2019, replacing Martine De Rouck. 
		 As the governance of Dexia and Dexia Credit Local is integrated, Patrick Renouvin is also Executive VicePresident and Chief Operating Officer of Dexia Credit Local. Claire Cheremetinski and Tamar Joulia-Paris are also directors of Dexia Credit Local. 
		 2. Results H1 2019 
		 A - Presentation of Dexia's condensed consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 
		 2019 
		 Going concern 
		 The condensed consolidated financial statements of Dexia as at 30 June 2019 were established in accordance with the accounting rules applicable to a going concern. This relies on a certain number of assumptions made in the business plan underlying the resolution of the Dexia Group, developed in the 
		 Appendix to this Press Release.

		 B - Dexia Group consolidated results H1 2019 
		 Net income Group share of EUR -546 million: significant impact of non-recurring elements (EUR -283 million) associated with finalisation of the sale of DKD (EUR -115 million), asset disposals (EUR -155 million) and of accounting volatility elements (EUR -112 million). 
		 Net recurring income (EUR -151 million) principally impacted by regulatory taxes and contributions (EUR -59 million) and the persistence of low rates, partially offset by a positive contribution of the cost of risk (EUR +23 million). 
		 In order to facilitate the reading of its results and to measure its dynamics during the year, Dexia breaks down its results into three distinct analytical segments.

		 ; 
		 EUR -112 million associated with account volatility elements5

		 Minority interests -25 -5 -26 
		 Net income, Group share -151 -170 -210 
		 (*) Pro forma for H1 2018. 
		 The net income Group share from recurring elements was EUR -151 million in the first half-year 2019, against EUR -170 million at the end of June 2018. 
		 Over the half-year, net banking income was negative at EUR -7 million, reflecting the net interest margin, which corresponds to the asset carrying cost, as well as the result of the Group's transformation. The net interest margin is down, particularly due to the persistence of historically low interest rates. 
		 Costs for the half-year were EUR -196 million, against EUR -220 million as at 30 June 2018. Of that amount, EUR -59 million are booked under income by virtue of regulatory taxes and contributions, the majority booked in Q1 in application of the IFRIC 21 accounting standard. The fall of EUR -24 million in costs compared with H1 2018 results from the decrease of regulatory taxes and contributions in line with the reduction of the size of the Group and the improvement of its risk profile. Despite the acceleration of the simplification of the international network, the amount of the Group's general operating expenses is liable to be impacted in H2 2019 by transformation costs and in particular those for renewing the IT infrastructure. 
		 The cost of risk was EUR +23 million and is principally explained by reversals of provisions as a consequence the disposal of impaired exposures. 
		 The tax charge was positive, at EUR 4 million. 
		 Accounting volatility elements 
		 In an environment marked by uncertainties related to Brexit, international trade tensions and accommodating signals from central banks, accounting volatility elements generated an impact of EUR -112 million at the end of June 2019, compared to EUR -217 million at the end of June 2018. This amount reflects the unfavourable evolution of the spread between the BOR and OIS rates in euros and pounds sterling and EUR/GBP cross currency basis swaps. 
		 Dexia S.A. - Place du Champ de Mars 5, B-1050 Bruxelles - 1, Passerelle des Reflets, <mention id="1895">Paris-La Defense</mention> 2, F-92919 La Defense Cedex 7 
		 Non-recurring elements 
		 Non-recurring elements booked over the half-year amounted to EUR -283 million and in particular included: 
		 losses associated with asset disposals and, to a lesser extent, repurchases of liabilities (EUR -155 
		 million); 
		 the net impact of the sale of DKD (EUR -115 million). This amount includes the net loss on the 
		 disposal as well as the net result of DKD as at 30 June 2019 (EUR -9.2 million); 
		 allocations and reversals of provisions for litigation, the net impact of which was EUR -6 million; 
		 provisions for restructuring costs, in an amount of EUR -8 million, in particular including the cost of 
		 the transformation of DCL New York; 
		 an exceptional contribution from Dexia Crediop to the Italian national resolution fund 
		 (EUR -2 million). 
		 3. Evolution of the balance sheet, solvency and the liquidity situation of the Group 
		 A - Balance sheet and solvency 
		 15% reduction of the balance sheet total compared to the end of 2018, associated with the sale 
		 of DKD and the reduction of the asset portfolio, despite a significant fall of interest rates 
		 Dexia's Total Capital ratio at 25.3% at the end of June 2019, against 27.3% as at 31 December 
		 2018 
		 a - Half-yearly evolution of the balance sheet 
		 As at 30 June 2019, the Group's consolidated balance sheet total stood at EUR 134.6 billion, compared to 
		 EUR 158.8 billion as at 31 December 2018. 
		 On the assets side and at constant exchange rates, the significant decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of DKD (EUR-24.4 billion) and the asset portfolio reductions (EUR -5.8 billion) was partially offset by an increase in fair value elements (EUR +4.6 billion) and cash collateral paid by the Group to its derivative counterparties (EUR +3 billion) due to the sharp decrease in interest rates compared to 31 December 2018. 
		 The balance sheet total remains very sensitive to changes in this market parameter. In particular, a 10 basis point decrease in long-term interest rates, principally in pounds sterling, is likely to lead to an increase of EUR 0.7 billion in the balance sheet total. 
		 On the liabilities side, at constant exchange rates, in addition to the impact of the deconsolidation of DKD, the evolution of the balance sheet is mainly reflected in a reduction of the stock of market funding (EUR -5.9 billion), an increase in the fair value of liabilities and derivatives (EUR +4.4 billion) and the amount of cash collateral received (EUR +1.3 billion). 
		 The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the evolution of the balance sheet is negligible. 
		 b - Solvency 
		 As at 30 June 2019, the Dexia Group's Common Equity Tier 1 capital was EUR 7.5 billion, compared to EUR 8.1 billion as at 31 December 2018 and was principally impacted by the negative net income for the period (EUR -546 million). 
		 Dexia S.A. - Place du Champ de Mars 5, B-1050 Bruxelles - 1, Passerelle des Reflets, <mention id="1896">Paris-La Defense</mention> 2, F-92919 <mention id="1897">La Defense</mention> Cedex 8 In line with the requirements of the European Central Bank, two elements were deducted from regulatory capital in a total amount of EUR -156 million: 
		 the theoretical loss corresponding to remediation on a failure to observe the constraint regarding large exposures, for an amount of EUR -107 million7 
		 the amount of irrevocable payment commitments (IPCs) to resolution funds and other guarantee funds, which amounts to EUR -49 million. 
		 In addition, following its on-site inspection of credit risk in 2018, the ECB issued a number of recommendations. As a result, Dexia deducted an amount of EUR -208 million from its prudential equity as a supplement for specific provisions, notably EUR -86 million on the exposure to the Chicago Board of Education (CBOE). Dexia will integrate all the conclusions of these inspections when they are finalised. 
		 Risk-weighted assets decreased very slightly during the half-year to EUR 30.3 billion as at 30 June 2019, of which EUR 28.4 billion for credit risk, EUR 0.9 billion for market risk and EUR 1 billion for operational risk. 
		 Taking these elements into account, Dexia's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 24.7% as at June 30, 2019, compared to 26.7% at the end of 2018. The Total Capital ratio was 25.3%, compared with 27.3% at the end of 2018, a level higher than the minimum required by the European Central Bank for 2019 as part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)8 . 
		 Dexia Credit Local's Common Equity Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios also meet the minimum requirements, at 21.5% and 22.0% respectively as at 30 June 2019. 
		 B - Evolution of the Dexia Group's liquidity situation 
		 Significant reduction of the funding volume in the first half-year 2019, partially linked to the 
		 deconsolidation of DKD 
		 Evolution of the funding mix, State-guaranteed funding representing 76% of total outstanding 
		 Absence of recourse to Eurosystem funding since September 2017 
		 As a consequence of the sale of DKD and the reduction of the asset portfolio, outstanding funding decreased by EUR -21.4 billion compared to 31 December 2018, to EUR 84.9 billion as at 30 June 2019, despite an increase of EUR +1.8 billion in net cash collateral, linked to the decrease in interest rates. The net amount of cash collateral amounted to EUR 24.5 billion as at 30 June 2019. 
		 The change in the funding mix was significant and was almost entirely due to the reduction in secured funding (EUR -17.3 billion compared to the end of December 2018) due to the deconsolidation of DKD, the outstanding covered bonds of which amounted to EUR 13.6 billion as at 31 December 2018. There was also a reduction in unsecured funding (EUR -4.1 billion compared to the end of December 2018) due in particular to the deconsolidation of DKD (EUR -1.3 billion) and a decrease in State-guaranteed funding (EUR -1.6 billion), bringing the outstanding amount to EUR 63.9 billion at the end of June 2019, representing 76% of total outstanding funding at that date. 
		 During the half-year, Dexia Credit Local successfully launched various long-term public transactions in euros, US dollars and pounds sterling, raising EUR 5.7 billion, or 80% of the annual long-term funding programme at a competitive funding cost. Short-term funding activity in guaranteed format was also strong, with an average maturity at issuance of 8.1 months. 
		 The Group has not used central bank funding since September 2017.

		 On the same date, the Group's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) stood at 254%, compared to 202% as at 31 December 2018. This ratio is also respected at subsidiary level, each exceeding the required minimum of 100%. The Group's Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), estimated on the basis of the latest proposals for amendments to the RRC, would be above the target threshold of 100%, as a result of the group's efforts since 2013 to improve its funding profile.

		 Appendices 
		 Appendix 1 - Going concernThe condensed consolidated financial statements of Dexia as at 30 June 2019 were prepared in accordance with the accounting rules applicable to a going concern. This requires a number of constituent assumptions underlying the business plan for the resolution of the Dexia Group, decided upon by the European Commission in December 2012. They are listed below: 
		 The macroeconomic hypotheses underlying the business plan are revised as part of the half-yearly reviews of the overall plan. The update made on the basis of market data observable as at 31 December 2018 and validated by the Board of Directors of Dexia on 23 April 2019 integrates the regulatory developments known to date, including the final version of the CRD IV Directive. It also takes account of the extremely positive impact on the Dexia Group's regulatory capital of the firsttime application of the IFRS 9 accounting standard as from 1 January 2018 and of the non-renewal, as from 1 January 2019, of the specific approach implemented by the European Central Bank for the supervision of the Dexia Group 9 . This update does not integrate all of the results of on-site inspections (OSI) by the European Central Bank, in particular the inspections on credit risk, IT risk and operational risk and outsourced activities, on which the definitive reports have not yet been received by Dexia. 
		 The ongoing resolution assumes that Dexia retains a sound funding capacity, relying in particular on the appetite of investors for debt guaranteed by the Belgian, French and Luxembourg States as well as on the Group's capacity to raise secured funding. 
		 The latest update of the business plan takes account of a revision of the funding plan relying on the last observable market conditions. In addition, since the end of 2012, Dexia has considerably reduced its funding requirement, diversified its access to different funding sources and taken advantage of favourable market conditions to extend the maturity of its liabilities, with a view to the prudent management of its liquidity. In particular, this enables the Group to maintain a level of liquidity reserves which is deemed appropriate considering the restriction of access to European Central Bank funding announced on 21 July 201710 
		 The business plan assumes the maintenance of the banking licences of Dexia and Dexia Credit Local and the maintenance of the Dexia Credit Local rating at a level of Investment Grade. 
		 Regular revisions of the business plan lead to adjustments to the original plan and over time involved a significant change of the Group's resolution trajectory as initially anticipated, particularly in terms of profitability, solvency and funding structure. At this stage, they do not raise any question as to the nature or the fundamentals of the resolution, which justifies the decision to establish the financial statements in accordance with 'going concern' principles. 
		 However, over the duration of the Group's resolution, uncertainties remain regarding the implementation of the business plan: 
		 In particular, this plan is likely to be impacted by new developments in accounting and prudential 
		 rules. 
		 The Dexia Group is also very sensitive to the evolution of the macroeconomic environment and to market parameters, particularly exchange rates, interest rates and credit spreads. An unfavourable evolution of these parameters over time could weigh on the Group's liquidity and its solvency position, for instance by increasing the amount of cash collateral paid by Dexia to its derivatives counterparties or an impact on the valuation of financial assets and liabilities and OTC derivatives, fluctuations of which are booked in the income statement and are liable to result in a fluctuation of

<titre>Saint-Gobain boss defiant after failed takeover</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE</auteur>
<texte>
		The chief executive of one of France's oldest industrial companies is in no mood for criticism. 
		 "Honestly, this is bullshit," Pierre-André de Chalendar, the boss of Saint-Gobain, told the Financial Times in response to accusations the company was too complex. While "it would be foolish for me to say we are perfect", those who criticise are "sometimes people who have uneducated views".
		Mr de Chalendar is understandably defensive. He has just come through a failed takeover attempt of Swiss chemical group Sika that shone a spotlight on a company critics say has suffered years of underperformance, poor investment decisions and top-heavy bureaucracy.  
		 The questions also come as President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to shake up outmoded practices at some of France's largest companies. 
		 Established by Louis XIV's finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1665 to counter Venetian glass imports, Saint-Gobain made the mirrors at Versailles before diversifying as the centuries unrolled. 
		 The company still produces glass, but also makes and distributes building and construction materials, and prides itself on embracing technology as a path to its future. It employs 180,000 people worldwide and in 2017 pulled in €40bn in sales. 
		 While its target Sika thrived as the battle raged, the tussle focused investors on Saint-Gobain's hunger for acquisitions, its balance sheet, profitability and management. Its share price has fallen 20 per cent over the past year.  
		 The Saint-Gobain boss is now trying to draw a line under his pursuit of Sika, which began in 2014 and ended without Saint-Gobain taking control but booking a large capital gain. 
		 The French company had tried to take Sika over by buying 52 per cent of the voting rights but only 16 per cent of the shares from the controlling Burkard family.  
		 But the deal became bogged down in the courts, with investors such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation complaining it flouted corporate governance norms and disadvantaged minority shareholders. 
		 The legal stand-off lasted more than three years and was finally resolved last month with a complex solution involving Saint-Gobain taking a stake of nearly 11 per cent in Sika but accepting six years of standstill agreements before it would be able to increase its holding past 12.9 per cent. 
		 Sika secured its independence and paid Saint-Gobain a premium to retire the outsized voting rights, while allowing the Burkards to exit the company. All parties were left with pride intact. 
		 "I think it's a good deal for everybody," said Mr de Chalendar. 
		 "In the end, it's a good compromise," Urs Burkard, who represented the Burkard family, told the FT, adding that Saint-Gobain "played fairly and honestly from day one". 
		 But the fight focused criticism on Saint-Gobain.  
		 Operating margins at its three core businesses - building distribution, innovative materials and construction products - are all below their recent peaks. Rating agency S&amp;P said the company's profitability ratios were lower than rated peers because of the low margins of its distribution business. 
		 Felix Brunotte, an analyst at independent research house AlphaValue, argued in March that Saint-Gobain was simultaneously "too centralised and too de-centralised".  
		 "For me, it's like a government with many layers of management," he said. "It's very complicated to do [any] change in the organisation." 
		 Mr Brunotte believes Saint-Gobain relies too much on acquisitions to fuel top-line growth - the company estimates it has made about 1,000 over its long history, including 60 over the past two years and more than€550m worth in 2017. 
		 The company has also pursued an aggressive share buyback programme in recent years, a strategy that can suggest organic growth opportunities may be lacking. 
		 Mr Brunotte argues Saint-Gobain's pension fund was underfunded, its asbestos liabilities were potentially open-ended, and its much-vaunted innovation were not delivering. 
		 Finally, he argues Saint-Gobain's return on capital employed - a measure of the efficiency of its investment - was below its cost of capital, measured by its weighted average cost of capital, WACC. This would be an indication that the company was not employing its capital effectively or creating value for shareholders. 
		 Christopher Rossbach, an investor in Sika at J. Stern &amp; Co, is highly dismissive of Saint-Gobain. He said companies such as Nestlé, Diageo and LVMH had "strong competitive positions in good and growing businesses, good managements, strong balance sheets and proven track records of generating long-term value. Saint-Gobain has none of that." 
		 Mr de Chalendar refuses to concede to the criticisms and insists Saint-Gobain's breadth, built through acquisitions, is one of its great strengths. 
		 On Mr Brunotte, he is more dismissive, saying his views were "nonsense". 
		 Saint-Gobain's chief financial officer, Guillaume Texier, added that the company's return on capital employed was 11.2 per cent in 2017, below its recent peak of 12.1 per cent in 2008, but beating its weighted average cost of capital of "approximately" 9.7 per cent. 
		 As far as acquisitions were concerned, Mr de Chalendar said valuations were high and he was "going to stay very disciplined". 
		 The effectiveness of Saint-Gobain research and development was measured, he added, by the proportion of products or solutions the company puts on the market that are less than five years old and, at about a quarter, it is performing well on this measure. 
		 S&amp;P said the company remained too highly focused on Europe - where the economic cycle was only now starting to turn in Saint-Gobain's favour. While the company now has operations in 67 countries compared with just 18 back in 1986, only a fifth of sales are in Asia and emerging markets.  
		 A quarter of its net sales are in France alone, by some distance its least profitable market, while its board and executive management remain resolutely French-dominated. 
		 Overall, criticism comes back to the central question of whether Saint-Gobain needs to modernise more quickly. This is even more important in light of Mr Macron's desire to drag corporate France into the 21st century by forcing companies to adapt and update. 
		 Indeed, it is not the first time Saint-Gobain has come under pressure to change.  
		 Ten years ago, Wendel, a French investment house almost as old as Saint-Gobain, tried and failed to shake the group up when it built a 20 per cent stake. 
		 Mr de Chalendar argues that what might have looked from outside the company like easy adjustments to make were in reality more challenging. But some investors suggest Wendel simply underestimated the cultural barriers to change within Saint-Gobain. 
		 Saint-Gobain is considered a French icon, something which could protect it from foreign takeovers, and its traditional culture, which favours internal advancement, is seen as a source of strength by the company. 
		 Its employees appear fiercely loyal and Saint-Gobain has bequeathed a wealth of top managers to France, including Philippe Crouzet of Vallourec, Valeo's Jacques Aschenbroich, and Michelin's Jean-Dominique Senard.

		 One senior banker in Paris, who has followed the company closely, said Saint-Gobain was "conscious of what history means and they . . . won't break their business just to create short-term shareholder value".  
		 Mr de Chalendar himself said that, although the company has needed radical change over its long history, his "vision of Saint-Gobain has not changed basically" since he took over in 2007. 
		 Saint-Gobain certainly does not feel like a company on the defensive. It moves into new, glossier headquarters in <mention id="1906">the La Défense business district</mention> next year. 
		 Mr de Chalendar, meanwhile, said he would like his legacy to show he had "transformed the culture of Saint-Gobain from being manufacturing-driven to customer-driven". 
		 He is also not alone in his confidence that the questions being asked about the company's performance will eventually lose resonance. 
		 As another senior banker in Paris, who knows the company well, said: "Saint-Gobain has survived revolutions, it will survive this too." 
		 Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Zurich 
		Digital evolution of company that saved a PM 
		 Saint-Gobain prides itself on its embrace of modern technology despite its 350 years of history. Its factories, churning out products from insulation through to smart-glass, are increasingly automated and boss Pierre-André de Chalendar spoke with great force about the company's digital evolution. 
		 He argued that middlemen in the construction industry would soon be needed less and customers would have increasing control over the products that make up their homes. That was an opportunity that demanded an embrace of technology and a strengthening of Saint-Gobain brands. 
		 But although his company goes to great pains to demonstrate its modern edge, it remains conscious of its long history - something Saint-Gobain's in-house historian is there to help with. 
		 On the north-eastern edge of Paris, Saint-Gobain has turned a 150-year-old warehouse into a showcase of its latest innovations in materials and technology. But even there it has a wall dedicated to its centuries of history with snapshots of landmarks leading the way into the building. 
		 Traces of its past can still be seen throughout France and its capital. The imposing <meronyme id="1907">Grande Arche</meronyme> at <mention id="1908">La Défense</mention>, the Grand Palais, the Pyramid at the Louvre, and the Eiffel Tower in central Paris can all thank Saint-Gobain for their glass façades, floors and ceilings. 
		 However, one of the company's most dramatic claims was saving a French prime minister. George Clemenceau's life was saved after a Saint-Gobain windshield stopped a bullet meant for him in 1919.

<titre>Brussels treads a fine line in gas pricing case against Gazprom</titre>
<auteur>FERDINANDO GIUGLIANO</auteur>
<texte>
		Much like superheroes of comic book lore, competition authorities strive to protect the man in the street from hulking giants that abuse their power. 
		 The villains are companies that typically inflict pain on consumers by charging more for goods and services than they could in a competitive market.
		That was one of the arguments used when the European Commission indicted Gazprom last week for exploiting its stranglehold on eastern Europe's gas supply to charge "unfairly high" prices. 
		 However, given the inherent difficulties in determining a "fair" price, economists warn that Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, is walking a fine line between punishing illegitimate behaviour and meddling with the smooth functioning of a market economy. 
		 "Antitrust law is about increasing or preserving competition to reach a fair price," says Mario Mariniello, a fellow at Bruegel, a European think-tank. "But setting a fair price is delicate ground where the European Commission would normally avoid to go." 
		 Brussels has not shied away from heavyweights such as General Electric, Microsoft and, more recently Google. But it has found charges of "excessive pricing", as they are known in economist parlance, among the most difficult, "and that is the reason we rarely, if ever, pursue them", says one EU official. 
		 In the case of Gazprom, the commission has found that the Russian energy company charges different prices across the EU. Lithuania, for instance, at times pays a third more than Germany. 
		 But experts say prices can vary across countries for a number of reasons, including distribution costs, the size of the market and the presence of other suppliers. 
		 "To prove that the price was excessive the commission needs to go around Europe looking for contracts struck in the same year with the same gas volumes," says Anna Creti, a competition economist at Université Paris Ouest Nanterre <mention id="1909">La Défense</mention>. "This will be very difficult." 
		 The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. 
		 Lawyers typically refer to a precedent set in a 1970s case involving United Brands, the banana company, which Brussels found guilty of charging excessively high prices in some countries. The European Court of Justice upheld the broad thrust of the case but struck down the decision on exploitative pricing, arguing that the commission had to compare prices with the company's cost structure. 
		 The commission appears to have learnt the lesson and, in last week's case, tried to compare prices with the costs facing Gazprom. But those familiar with the investigation acknowledge the difficulty of finding and defining the appropriate benchmark. Moreover the commission is loath to put itself in the position of enforcing a decision that makes it a de-facto price regulator. 
		 Economists also warn that intervening once a contract has been sealed risks discouraging corporate investment in infrastructure. 
		 "If you set a fair price which is below the price charged in a market, you risk distorting how rewards are awarded to investors," says Mr Mariniello. "This can reduce the incentive to invest." 
		 Other competition experts believe there are exceptional circumstances in which antitrust authorities have a right to challenge the prices set by monopolies, particularly when they sense there may be other abuses at play. 
		 This is the case for Gazprom, which the commission has also accused of stopping countries from reselling gas abroad and blocking the emergence of other gas supplies. 
		 "When you also have exclusionary abuses, it makes more sense to talk about excessive pricing," says Alexandre De Streel, professor of European law at the universities of Namur and Louvain. "With a very strong proof of exclusionary abuses, then the case is not that weak." 
		 &amp;lt;&amp;gt;Crucially, this position appears to be shared by Massimo Motta, the commission's chief competition economist, in "Excessive Pricing in Competition Law: Never say Never?", an article published in 2007 with Mr De Streel. In the article, the academics write that while "extreme caution should be exercised in the use of excessive pricing actions [ . . .] there may be some very exceptional circumstances where such actions may be justified". 
		 It is also possible that the commission is playing a political game in an attempt to strengthen the negotiating position of smaller member states vis-à-vis Gazprom at a time of tense relations between the EU and Russia. 
		 "In pure economic terms, the commission's decision [on excessive pricing] is hard to justify," said Ms Creti. "But there may be a mixture of political positioning and signals against Gazprom, especially with respect to what will happen in the coming winter." 
		 Others believe this may be the start of a negotiation. "Maybe the European Commission is pushing Gazprom to make a proposal on price and then decide," says Mr Mariniello. "It is far easier to say if a price is unfair than to determine what is fair."

<titre>French economists unite against central bank chief nominee</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		More than 140 French economists have put their name to an open letter protesting against the nomination of Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who was until recently the co-chief operating officer of BNP Paribas, as the next governor of the Bank of France. 
		 Citing a "serious" conflict of interests, the economists, led by Jézabel Couppey-Soubeyran of the prestigious Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, Laurence Scialom, of the university Paris Ouest Nanterre <mention id="1910">La Défense</mention> and Anne-Laure Delatte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), call for Mr Villeroy de Galhau's appointment to be blocked.
		<mention id="1911">They</mention> claim that while his experience has no doubt allowed him to build up "excellent expertise" on the banking sector, it is "completely illusory" to believe that someone can serve in the banking sector and then a few months later be responsible for regulating it "with impartiality and total independence". 
		 Mr Villeroy de Galhau was co-chief operating officer at BNP until May but was last week nominated by French President François Hollande to succeed Christian Noyer as governor of the Bank of France. 
		 "It's not as if the president did not have a choice," the economists write. "It was entirely possible to promote, at the heart of the Bank of France, an internal candidate who is much less exposed to the risk of conflicts of interests."

<titre>Paris attacks: Belgium launches hunt for new suspect</titre>
<auteur>JIM BRUNSDEN</auteur>
<texte>
		The scope of Belgium's investigation into the Paris terrorist attacks widened on Tuesday when it launched a hunt for a new suspect. 
		 The Belgian state prosecutor said that an international warrant had been issued for Mohamed Abrini, aged 30, who is suspected of having been the driver of a Renault Clio abandoned by the attackers in northern Paris on the night of the assault.
		Investigators said Salah Abdeslam, the prime suspect still on the loose, was caught on camera with Mr Abrini two days before the attacks at a motorway service station near Ressons, a town in northern France that is on the route from Belgium to Paris. The prosecutor described Mr Abrini as "armed and dangerous". 
		 Belgian authorities also added to the sequence of events surrounding Mr Abdeslam's escape. He was already known to have fled France with help from two associates. 
		 But authorities now believe he subsequently travelled in another car after returning to Belgium. The driver of that vehicle, at this stage identified only as "Ali O", a 31-year-old French national living in Molenbeek, Brussels, was arrested in one of the raids across the city on Sunday night. 
		 Investigators are also holding another man, "Lazez A", a 39-year-old Moroccan national living in the outlying Brussels district of Jette. While they have yet to give details of his alleged role in the attacks, prosecutors said that handguns and traces of blood had been found in his car. Another, unnamed, suspect is also being held. 
		 The developments bring the number of people arrested by the Belgian authorities in relation to the attacks to five. They include Mohammed Amri, the driver of the Volkswagen Golf that brought Mr Abdeslam back to Belgium on Saturday morning, and Hamza Attou, an accompanying passenger. 
		 All have been charged, or are being held under suspicion of "participation in the activities of a terrorist group and terrorist murders". 
		 On Tuesday, Francois Molins, the Paris prosecutor, confirmed the presence of a second person in the Clio driven by Mr Abrini, but stopped short of giving a name. 
		 Filling in details of the deadly attacks on November 13, Mr Molins said that Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who was killed in a shootout with police last Wednesday, had been planning to launch another attack with an unidentified accomplice on <mention id="1912">Paris's La Défense district</mention> on November 18 or 19. 
		 Mr Molins said that this unidentified person, who was killed in the raid on the Saint-Denis flat last week, is believed to have been the third person in the black Seat car that was used for drive-by shootings on bars and restaurants in Paris's 10th and 11th districts.

<titre>Jean-Philippe Ammeux, Iéseg</titre>
<auteur>DELLA BRADSHAW</auteur>
<texte>
		Jean-Philippe Ammeux is an Iéseg man through and through. Almost most of his adult life has been spent at the Lille-based business school, where he began his studies as an undergraduate in 1974. It was five years later in 1979 that he got his first job there as a teaching assistant, and by 1984 he held the title professor.  
		 But it is in the last decade, since the silver-haired Prof Ammeux took over as dean, that his influence on the school has been really felt.
		Iéseg - or Institut d'Économie Scientifique et de Gestion, to give it its full title - was one of the first French business schools to begin teaching in English 15 years ago, and it has proven to be a real platform from which the dean can build international alliances, programmes and a more global reputation. 
		 Prof Ammeux clearly intends for Iéseg, which is now celebrating its 50th birthday, to be on the first track. "The school is just at the beginning," he asserts. 
		 This year's list of new programmes is certainly impressive. Prof Ammeux plans to increase the number of specialised masters degrees by 50 per cent, by launching degrees in big data analytics, banking and capital markets, and negotiations.  
		 The school, which, like Edhec, is part of the Université Catholique de Lille, is also getting into the MBA market. In September the school will launch an Executive MBA - an MBA for working managers - to complement its International MBA programme, which was launched in 2014 with 120 students. The MBA is taught on the school's second campus in <mention id="1913">Paris La Défense</mention>.  
		 But above all, the business school is reaching beyond its French boundaries to form tie-ups with business schools around the world. It had 235 partners at the last count, some, such as Cornell and Manchester, among the top business schools in the world. 
		 "Everyone wants to go to an international business school," says Prof Ammeux of the school's 4,000 students. 
		 Although all masters programmes are now taught completely in English, many of the undergraduate students still begin their studies in French and learn English along the way in order to take advantage of the school's numerous exchanges. 
		 There is a clear reason for participants studying in French in the first year, according to the genial dean. Although the school is one of France's elite grandes écoles, it has an inclusion policy through which it hopes to attract young students from less affluent regions of the country. 
		 "For underprivileged students, English has not been a priority," explains Prof Ammeux. "What is provided in high school is not enough."

<titre>Entrepreneurship classes grow up</titre>
<auteur>IAN WYLIE</auteur>
<texte>
		Christine Marcus did not plan on choosing entrepreneurship from the menu when she enrolled on the MIT Sloan executive MBA programme. "If someone had told me I'd leave Sloan as CEO of a food tech start-up, I would have assumed they'd had one too many sangrias," says Marcus, who took the EMBA to give her a broader perspective beyond her background as a chief financial officer at the US Department of Energy in Washington, DC. 
		 But after graduating in 2013, Marcus and classmate Sal Lupoli co-founded Phoodeez (being rebranded as Alchemista), a tech-enabled corporate catering start-up that helps people order the correct amount of food for their number of guests, in a bid to avoid huge amounts of wasted catered food at meetings and events. "While I loved my career in federal government and public service, I know now that entrepreneurship is a part of my soul and a very exciting way to impact the world."
		Entrepreneurship education is an exploding, multi-billion dollar industry. But amid the froth, hyperbole and excitement, business schools are beginning to question the purpose of entrepreneurship education on their EMBA curriculums. Is it to incubate the next hot-shot invention? Or should they equip graduates with proven knowledge and skills to launch their own start-ups? Or should they send executives back to their employers to kick-start innovation as "intrapreneurs"? 
		 Bill Aulet, one of Marcus's senior lecturers at MIT Sloan, believes it is time entrepreneurship education in business schools grew up, underpinning classes with greater academic research and rigour.  
		 "People say entrepreneurship education is all practitioner-based, but that's like saying we don't need to research medicine to train doctors," says Aulet, who is managing director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship and author of  Disciplined Entrepreneurship , a book that argues entrepreneurship can be chunked into specific, teachable behaviours and processes. 
		 "Business schools are full of entrepreneurs telling stories about their experiences, but students need strong pedagogy too," argues Aulet, who recently launched the Entrepreneurship Educators Forum, an open-source community for entrepreneurship educators to share information and best practices. 
		 Steve Blank, a Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur and adjunct professor at Columbia, NYU Stern and Berkeley-Haas, is another critic of the way business schools teach entrepreneurship. "Not every EMBA student wants to start their own business, but every student should be learning corporate entrepreneurship," says Blank. "Large companies are being continually disrupted and to respond they need executives who understand how start-ups innovate at speed." 
		 However, Blank, who developed the "lean start-up" method, says more research is needed to develop specific tools for corporate entrepreneurs and warns EMBA students to examine course content carefully. "If the capstone of the entrepreneurship class is still 'how to write a business plan' or if the curriculum looks the same as five years ago, you're probably joining the wrong school," he advises.  
		 George Abe, faculty director at UCLA Anderson School of Management, says the tools and knowledge taught to EMBA students must be applicable to all sectors. "Most schools emphasise a minimum viable product or lean start-up approach, which is hip and applicable for businesses like social media, B2C and games," he says. "But it's not really suited to biotech, alternative energy or international business services. Also most schools don't teach spin-offs, corporate venture capital or family business and succession planning." 
		 Local or regional context are also shaping how some schools now view entrepreneurship. Bernard Garrette, strategy professor at HEC, believes the school's strength is in making managers, not inventors. "Like all schools, we found there was a strong appetite for entrepreneurship, but we also realised that in most cases students came up with ideas that were just copies of things they'd seen elsewhere." 
		 In response, HEC has redesigned its entrepreneurship specialisation to introduce students to engineers, scientists and researchers at other institutions within the local Paris-Saclay research cluster.  
		 "Instead of trying to transform business people into inventors or vice versa, we allow each partner to do what they are very good at." 
		 The European School of Management and Technology in Berlin has always had a core entrepreneurship module on its EMBA. But Berlin's flourishing reputation as a start-up capital and the creation of a new German Tech Entrepreneurship Center on campus means the school is attracting more entrepreneurs to the EMBA who value the opportunity to spend time with like minds, explains associate dean Nick Barniville.  
		 "Some students will start their own businesses after they graduate, but not always to the detriment of the sponsoring company," says Barniville who points to the example of André Glardon, a recent EMBA graduate from Siemens who started his own chain of MRI clinics leasing Siemens machines. 
		 At EMLyon there is a new elective - the "European entrepreneurial journey", which will link EMBA students with academics in other countries to discuss the key entrepreneurship issues and challenges in their respective locations.  
		 A new EMBA course at Iéseg in <mention id="1914">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> may not have a specific entrepreneurship module, but associate professor Catherine Demangeot says the programme has been designed to integrate entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial thinking throughout. 
		 While in China, Ceibs has added entrepreneurship courses to its EMBA curriculum. Its new MBA E-Lab may be a modest space carved out of the canteen, but Charles Chen, EMBA director, hopes it will create synergies among students and alumni.  
		 "We've seen increasing interest among our students and applicants in launching their own business," says Prof Chen. "There's also been a strong signal in that direction from the Chinese government... Ceibs has always placed strong emphasis on entrepreneurship." 
		 For students such as Jevon Le Roux, the opportunities presented by being able to study entrepreneurship while doing an EMBA were too good to miss. 
		 The former pro surfer who introduced the Hurley fashion brand to South Africa is now enrolled on the EMBA at HEC Paris. "To grow from strength to strength requires an intimate understanding of the various moving parts of business." 
		 With HEC's help, Le Roux and fellow student François de Le Rue are working with the inventors of flying-camera Hexo+.  
		 Together, they hope to develop a strategic sales and marketing plan that will help the inventors change the way wearable cameras, such as GoPro, capture action sports.

<titre>Total's Patrick Pouyanné vows surgical response to oil price slide</titre>
<auteur>CHRISTOPHER ADAMS</auteur>
<texte>
		As a posse of Total managers heads for the lifts, Patrick Pouyanné peels away to his office at the top of <meronyme id="1915">the French oil major's imposing tower</meronyme> at <mention id="1916">La Défense</mention>, in the heart of <mention id="1917">Paris's business district</mention>. 
		 The newly installed chief executive of Total collapses into a sofa opposite a painting of a refinery fire - the Le Havre plant set ablaze by company employees in 1940 before the German army arrived. The dramatic scene is apt, given the turmoil confronting energy companies including Total.
		In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Pouyanné says Total will "weather the storm" sweeping through the oil and gas industry by accelerating and deepening a group-wide cost-cutting plan initiated by his predecessor, the late Christophe de Margerie. 
		 But while this plan will involve steep spending reductions, Mr Pouyanné insists his response to a halving in crude oil prices since last June will be surgical rather than drastic. He will sell some less profitable exploration and development projects, and delay others. There will also be a contentious restructuring of Total's troubled refining business in France, but, he stresses, "nobody will be fired". 
		 "We are all rediscovering that oil is a volatile commodity," Mr Pouyanné says, pointing to weaker than expected growth in global demand for oil, the boom in US shale output and a Saudi-led decision by Opec in November not to cut production as reasons for the price collapse to less than $50 a barrel. He sees little sign of a rebound in the first half of 2015. 
		 Mr Pouyanné's central aim is therefore to reduce Total's "break-even" price - the minimum level at which the group can profitably produce oil - by $40 a barrel. 
		 He believes this goal is proportionate. "We have to react, but not overreact," he says. "A major company like Total has always been successful when we manage to maintain our base strategy for these types of low prices . . . The best way to face this volatility is to have the company strong enough to lower your cash break-even." 
		 Underlying Mr Pouyanné's plan is a "very important" commitment to maintain Total's dividend - something he regards as essential to maintain investor confidence in the company. 
		 Total, Mr Pouyanné says, will reduce group capital spending by 10 per cent in 2015, from $26bn last year - a larger cut than expected. Of that reduction, the exploration budget - the easiest area where majors can save money - will be cut 30 per cent to less than $2bn. 
		 Two costly oil sands developments in Canada will be put on "a long backburner" and proposals to dispose of $10bn in assets by 2017 will be accelerated. 
		 There will be bigger savings in operating spending this year - $1.2bn rather than a previously planned $800m. Part of this will involve expenditure on mature "brownfield" projects such as Alwyn in the North Sea slowing. 
		 Downstream oil refining operations will face capacity reductions, leading to partial site closures of the kind that have proved contentious with French trade unions. While the slide in crude provides some relief, Total's European refining margins are weak, as the sector struggles to compete with more efficient plants in the Middle East, overcapacity in Europe and falling petrol and diesel consumption. 
		 Mr Pouyanné says no refineries will be shut but three in Europe face high break-even prices. The model of Total's Carling petrochemical plant in Lorraine - where the steam cracker used to produce lighter hydrocarbons is closing at the cost of at least 200 jobs - will be used as a template for those refineries that need to be restructured. 
		 The group will have to tread carefully. "We have the model of the steam cracker in Carling [to work with]," he says.  
		 While he is unable to guarantee no French jobs will be lost, nobody will be sacked and those affected will be found other roles within Total. 
		 Mr Pouyanné, who ran Total's downstream operations before being appointed chief executive, says that after a three-year restructuring plan ending this year the division will have saved $300m in operating expenditure. The refining margin was $20 a tonne in 2014, he says, but the group's base assumption is that it will be $25 in the future. 
		 He is anxious, however, to avoid cutting too deep and threaten future output growth, saying oil prices will eventually rebound. He dismisses the idea that Total, the largest producer in the North Sea, could begin decommissioning fields in the region as the economics deteriorate. It will continue to invest in Angola, where last month he inaugurated the 160,000 barrels a day CLOV project, and the company is as committed to Russia as it was before de Margerie's death in a Moscow plane crash in October.  
		 Total is developing the $27bn Yamal liquefied natural gas project in the far north of Russia with partners including Novatek and CNPC, but is coming under pressure because of western sanctions on Moscow related to Ukraine. The sanctions prevent dollar funding, but Mr Pouyanné is confident financing will be in place by mid-2015, drawn from European and Chinese banks. 
		 He will not be deterred by sanctions. "It has been a long effort to go to Russia . . . You will not jeopardise that," he says. "People have memories. You have to be with the partners not only when it's a good time, when the power is high, when things are developing, but also when it's harder." 
		 And what kind of industry will emerge from the price collapse - does he foresee a wave of mergers? "You will see some impact on smaller players. I think it will be an opportunity for larger players maybe to have access to resources at a lower cost." 
		 Total could play a part in that consolidation if, say, the slide in prices leads to a shakeout among the US shale producers: "We are pragmatic. If there are good deals, we will study them. But we need not rush." 
		 --------------- 
		 Filling the shoes of 'Big Moustache' 
		More than any other oil major Total has been associated with the personality of one man - the group's gregarious and well connected former chief executive Christophe de Margerie, also known as the Big Moustache,  writes Michael Stothard . 
		 For Patrick Pouyanné, 51, who succeeded de Margerie following his death last year, the challenge of inspiring employees, amid falling oil prices and cost cutting, while nurturing the same kind of working relationships as his predecessor with foreign governments, will be immense. 
		 What, then, will define Mr Pouyanné's leadership style? "You don't need to be clever, let's stick to the basics," he says, citing four management tenets: safety, delivery on projects and financial targets, cost-cutting and a laser-like focus on "creating cash". 
		 Mr Pouyanné does not shy away from a hard-won reputation as a ruthless instigator of change - notably through cost-cutting. 
		 Yet he does not want simply be seen as the right person for navigating leaner times. 
		 Mr Pouyanné believes he has the "same capacity to be intuitive as [de Margerie] had", speaking about his predecessor's famed charm, which analysts and investors saw as a key strength in negotiating big foreign projects in difficult countries. 
		 "I maybe have one advantage," he adds. "Because of the dramatic events of 2014, there is a strong feeling of union in our company. They have a situation where they lost their cheerful CEO and they want to face this economic situation . . . Everyone is motivated to demonstrate that Total is strong. I need to maintain this motivation."

<titre>Which is the best £1m investment: a city pad or country manor?</titre>
<auteur>NATHAN BROOKER</auteur>
<texte>
		Anyone looking to expand their property portfolio may well have encountered the term "value gap". It is a current favourite among estate agents to describe the price discrepancy between city and provincial markets. According to research from Savills, it can be substantial: in the UK the London property market is today about 35 per cent above its 2007 peak; in rural areas house prices are still 13 per cent down. 
		 There is increasing talk about the bargains available by trading in a city bolt-hole for a place in the country. Oliver Knight, of estate agents Knight Frank, estimates that a well turned-out home in the Cotswolds will sell for about £500 per sq ft, while in inner London it is hard to find anything below £1,250 per sq ft. In super prime areas, such as Mayfair, that figure can be above £2,200, according to joint research from Lonres and Dataloft.
		Overseas, the uplift can be even more pronounced. Diletta Giorgolo Spinola, head of sales at Sotheby's office in Tuscany, says that the price per sq metre of an apartment in Rome is at least four times higher than that of a villa in the Marche countryside, and often a lot more. According to figures published by the Notaries of France, median prices in Paris can be up to seven times that of rural or provincial areas. 
		 So, given £1m in spending money, is it better to go for a compact city pad or a sprawling country manor? The FT has compiled a list of five locations to show the difference. But before you decide which, it might be worth considering some words of warning from Roarie Scarisbrick, of the buying agents Property Vision. Earlier this year, he thought about trading in a three-bedroom house in Fulham and moving to the countryside outside London.  
		 "I had dreams of gatehouses and lodges and rolling hills, and had to come back with my tail between my legs," he says. "The reality is a tiny house in London is worth about as much as a tiny house in the home counties." Only once you move beyond a commutable distance from the capital - Scarisbrick estimates about 70 miles away - does the value gap start to open up. 
		 Still, with London fading - the prime market having dropped about 0.9 per cent in the 12 months to the first quarter of 2015, according to Savills - and the rural market holding steady, is now as good a time as any to buy a place in a remote corner of the countryside? 
		 "It's not a bad idea, but only if it works for you," says Scarisbrick. "If you're doing it for an investment play, then the chance of you making any money is a bit of gamble."

		 ABSTRACT 
		 Reinforced concrete structures exposed to a marine environment deteriorate as a result of chloride-induced corrosion of the steel rebars. A wide variety of models to predict chloride ingress in water-saturated concretes have already been developed to understand and predict the underlying transport processes. The majority of these models focus on the initiation period of chloride-induced corrosion in order to predict the service life of reinforced concrete structures. They require information on the concrete properties, the concrete cover thickness, the definition of corrosion initiation, etc. These models combine well-known mechanisms, i.e. diffusion of relevant ions, electrical interactions between ions, and interactions between these ions and the solid matrix. As the mechanisms to consider are well identified, the objective here is to perform a probabilistic analysis of some common models. A general framework is proposed to calculate a reliability service life for reinforced concrete structures under chloride attack in case of continuous immersion in seawater. Then a sensitivity analysis is performed in terms of the most relevant mechanisms and influencing input data. The results point out the crucial role of the concrete cover thickness, the critical chloride content and, to a lesser extent, the effective chloride diffusion coefficient. The difficulty to use the Freundlich isotherm for chloride binding is highlighted; it seems to be due to the non-linearity of the description which is still difficult to control.

		 1. Introduction 
		 Nowadays, designers of reinforced concrete (RC) structures have to deal with service life issues related to degradations resulting from mechanical, chemical and environmental actions, as well as more general sustainability issues (reduction of the carbon footprint, limitation of the depletion of natural resources, etc.). To achieve this multi-criteria objective, the common approach [1,2] is based on requirements about mix-design parameters, thickness of concrete cover, etc., and thus does not provide an adequate guide for designers to develop innovative, environment-friendly and sustainable solutions. Considering environmental attacks, more flexible approaches based on performances to be achieved in terms of durability indicators (DIs) have been developed [3-5], The authors consider predictive durability models consistent with these approaches, i.e. they use DIs as input data and they have a clear physical and chemical basis. 
		 This present study deals in particular with the issue of chloride-induced corrosion [6] of the embedded steel rebars. This degradation mechanism can lead to a shortening of Service Life (SL) of RC structures (exposed to seawater or deicing salts). The simplest and most conservative approach to determine the SL of RC structures is to consider only the initiation period of steel corrosion. For this purpose, predictive models [7-14] take account of microstructure, transport (gas, water, ions) and chemical properties of concrete. 
		 In this paper, only fully water-saturated concretes are considered, i.e. chloride ingress is limited to a coupled diffusion-binding process. This situation represents a theoretical case since major problems of chloride-induced corrosion are observed for RC structures subjected to wetting-drying cycles (tidal zone). Nevertheless, the assumption of chloride transport through fully water-saturated materials has shown its relevance in many cases (at least for high performance concretes). Furthermore, this approach has the advantage of simplicity given the limited number of involved input data. 
		 To increase the relevance of the prediction for practice, durability models can be coupled with reliability tools [15-23], In this way, they can integrate the uncertainties of measurements [24], the variability of cementitious materials properties and quality of execution (e.g. concrete cover thickness). The present study is carried out with this framework in mind. 
		 The main objective of this paper is to perform a sensitivity analysis of predictive tools in terms of the most relevant mechanisms and influencing input data (choices of correlation, mean value and variability). This could help to define an effective strategy for the assessment of input data for durability models. 
		 The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, chloride ingress models are presented. Different levels of refinement are proposed: diffusion of chloride ions only or multi-diffusion of major ions present in seawater and pore water, adsorption phenomena of ions on the solid matrix, buffering role of portlandite (Ca(OH)2), etc. Four chloride ingress models are selected based on their simplicity and their acceptable computation time even if coupled with a probabilistic approach. Secondly, reliability approaches are introduced and the different tools used for sensitivity analysis are described in detail. Thereafter, a large range of cementitious materials are studied and the statistical distribution for each input data is presented. A methodology for a probabilistic SL prediction of RC structures immersed in seawater is provided. A comparative study of these four chloride ingress models is performed. Sensitivity analysis is then carried out, and the impacts of the mean and the standard deviation for each input data, as well as the correlation coefficients, are quantified. 
		 2. Service life prediction models 
		 2.1. From chloride ingress models ... 
		 This paper focuses on one-dimensional and engineering-friendly models predicting chloride ingress within water-saturated cementitious materials. Four mathematical models have been chosen from those already discussed in a previous paper [25]: Erf, MI1_Fre (Mono-ionic model + Freundlich isotherm), MS5_Fre (Multispecies model involving 5 ions + Freundlich isotherm) and MS8_K_act (Multispecies model involving 8 ions + Kari isotherms + equilibrium of the precipitation-dissolution reaction of Ca [(0H).sub.2]). Thanks to models which mostly use intrinsic input data and to their general level of refinement, chloride ingress can be predicted for any type of cementitious material, from the ordinary to the high performance material, with or without supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) [12,26-28], Table 1 provides an overview of the key features of each model. 
		 At the most eight dissolved salts in seawater ions are considered: chloride ([Cl.sup.-]), sodium ([Na.sup.+]), potassium ([K.sup.+]), calcium ([Ca.sup.2+]), magnesium ([Mg.sup.2+]), sulfate (S[O.sup.2-.sub. 4]), hydroxyl (O[H.sup.-]) and hydrogen ([H.sup.+]). These ions represent correspond to the principal ionic species present in seawater and, as well as in the concrete interstitial solution. 
		 These four models differ in terms of description of transport: two of them consider only one single ion, i.e. chlorides (Erf and MI1_Fre), whereas the other two are multi-species (MS5_Fre and MS8_K_act). Single ion models are based on the assumption that chloride ingress is only controlled by diffusion (Fick's law) while multi-species models consider the diffusion of all considered ionic species as well as the electrical interactions between them. The simplified Nernst-Planck equation can model this coupled movement of ions: 
		 [J.sub.i] = -[D.sub.i] [[partial derivative][c.sub.i]/[partial derivative]x + [c.sub.i][z.sub.i]F/RT [partial derivative][psi]/[partial derivative]x] (1) 
		 where [J.sub.i], [D.sub.i], [c.sub.i] and [z.sub.i] are the molar flux (mol/[m.sup.2]/s), the effective diffusion coefficient ([m.sup.2]/s), the concentration (mol/[m.sup.3]), the valence number (-) associated with each ion i, respectively. [psi] is the local electrical potential (V) which arises in order to maintain electroneutrality in the pore solution. Fis the Faraday constant (9.649 x [10.sup.-4] - C/mol), R the ideal gas constant (8.314J/mol/K), T the absolute temperature (K), and x the depth (m). In order to apply the Nernst-Planck equation, for all ions the effective diffusion coefficients are assumed to be proportional to each other [27,28]: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (2) 
		 where [tau] and [phi] are the tortuosity (-) and the porosity (-) of the cementitious materials, respectively. [D.sup.0.sub.i] is the intrinsic diffusion coefficient in water related to ion i. Using Eq. (2), all the effective diffusion coefficients can be assessed from the knowledge of [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]. 
		 The binding of ions onto the solid cementitious matrix is considered. This phenomenon is taken at equilibrium [14,29], thus all the relations are based on an explicit physically-based formula between free and bound ions. The adopted description relies on previously proposed theories of physical adsorption onto solid surfaces (mainly onto calcium silicate hydrates C-S-H). Three levels of refinement are developed (see Table 1): a linear function (model Erf), the Freundlich isotherm (MIl_Fre and MS5_Fre) and a competitive multi-species adsorption named Kari model (MS8_K_act), described in more detail in Appendix A and in Kari et al. 110]. These CBIs implicitly consider chemical binding (see methods of assessment in Section 4). Indeed, as their parameters are generally determined using inverse analysis of measured chloride profiles (total content and free concentration of ions CI), the authors consider that both chemical and physical binding are reflected in the fitted parameters. The chosen formulas are not able to take account for aging and/or kinetic effects. Firstly, the authors are indeed not convinced that the descriptions of aging and kinetic effects available in the literature are enough consolidated. Since those descriptions are mostly empirical, their introduction in the present approach would have led to inconsistencies with physically-based relationships which are preferred. Secondly, the determination of the statistical distribution for the parameters representing these phenomena would have been difficult. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to consider that the variability which is introduced for the binding parameters encompasses those aging and/or kinetics phenomena. 
		 The pH-buffering role of portlandite Ca[(OH).sub.2] is only introduced in case of the model MS8_K_act, assuming that the content of Ca[(OH).sub.2] is high enough to ensure its equilibrium with the pore solution anytime and anywhere. It leads to the following relationship: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (3) 
		 where [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] are the free concentration (mol/[m.sup.3]) of calcium and hydroxyl ions, respectively. [K.sub.p] is the equilibrium constant of the dissolution-precipitation reaction of portlandite which depends on the ambient temperature. 
		 This set of equations is complemented by molar conservative equations. For each ionic species, a balance equation is written: 
		 [partial derivative][n.sub.i]/[partial derivative]t = -[??].[[??].sub.i] (4) 
		 where t is the time (s) and [n.sub.i] is the molar content of the ionic species i (mol/[m.sup.3] of concrete). 
		 For the three models MI1_Fre, MS5_Fre and MS8_K_act, the set of equations (transport and binding) is solved by a finite-element code named Bil implemented in C language (url: http://perso.lcpc.fr/dangla.patrick/bil/index.html). 
		 For the Erf model, an analytical formula is available: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (5) 
		 where [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] are the initial and boundary free chloride concentration (mol/[m.sup.3]), respectively, erf is the error function. 
		 2.2. ... towards service life prediction 
		 In this paper, SL prediction of RC structures corresponds to the initiation period of chloride-induced corrosion, i.e. the time required for the depassivation of the first layer of steel bars. Numerous parameters can influence the depassivation [30,31]: steel surface condition, binder properties, characteristics of the concrete/steel interface [32] and environmental factors. 
		 Hausmann [33] introduced the notion of a critical chloride content required for the depassivation of steel rebars. The DuraCrete project [23] mentioned that the critical chloride content is defined as "the amount at which a depassivation of the steel surface and iron dissolution begins, irrespective of whether it leads to visible corrosion damage on the concrete surface". This definition is chosen here for its simplicity. As mentioned by Angst et al. [30], the critical chloride content can be expressed in different ways: a total chloride content, a free chloride concentration or a ratio between the free chloride and hydroxyl concentrations [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]. Glass and Buenfeld [31] discussed the relevance of a threshold level based on a free chloride concentration by pointing out that bound chlorides present a corrosion risk and that the resistance of concrete against chloride is not only related to the presence of hydroxyl ions but also to many other species. Moreover, it remains difficult to accurately measure free chloride and pH within concrete. In view of the critics regarding the involvement of free chloride in the definition of the threshold level of chloride-induced corrosion, the authors have chosen the expression of total chloride content [n.sub.th] (subscript th refers to threshold), besides as used many times in the literature [23,30,31,34-39]. 
		 Therefore, the critical depth [x.sub.th] is defined as the depth with respect to the exposed concrete surface at which [n.sub.th] is reached. This depth is compared to the concrete cover thickness e to assess the SL. 
		 3. Reliability approaches 
		 3.1. Principles of the reliability approaches 
		 Reliability approaches aim to determine the time-dependent failure probability [P.sub.f](t) as a function of the model input data which are considered as random variables. Lemaire et al. [40] define the concepts used in the present research: 
		 * A random vector [??] among input data of the models. According to the choice of model, [??] corresponds to: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (6) 
		 where [phi] and [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] are the porosity (-) and the effective chloride diffusion coefficient ([m.sup.2]/s), respectively. K, ([mu], [gamma]) or [C.sub.ads] are the parameters (-) of CBIs. [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] are the initial concentrations (mol/[m.sup.3]) of sodium, potassium and hydroxyl ions in the pore solution, respectively. Probability distribution (type, mean value and standard deviation) and linear correlation coefficients are necessary. 
		 * A failure scenario defined by a limit state function G: 
		 G([??],t) = e-[x.sub.th]([??],t) (7) 
		 This function G defines three states: if [x.sub.th]  e, it represents the safety domain; if [x.sub.th] = e, it equals the limit state and if [x.sub.th]  e, it represents the failure domain. 
		 * The failure probability is defined as: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (8) 
		 where [f.sub.x] is the joint probability density function of the random vector [??]. 
		 Direct calculation of [P.sub.f](t) presents many difficulties. Firstly, the failure domain C([??], t) [less than or equal to] 0 is not explicitly known for three of the four studied chloride ingress models (except for the model Erf) since the limit state function C is calculated using a finite-volume code. Secondly, for correlated random variables, the joint probability density function [f.sub.x] cannot be determined using the probability density functions [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] of each input data [X.sub.i] and the correlation coefficients between the input data. 
		 In this paper, different calculation techniques [40] are used to assess [P.sub.f] by means of numerical tools: 
		 * First Order Reliability Method (FORM): The calculations are performed in the standardized Gaussian space, i.e. the physical [??] is converted to a vector [??] of centered, standard and uncorrected Gaussian variables using the Nataf transformation [40], FORM solves the optimization problem of the distance [beta] (hereafter named the reliability index) from the origin (mean value point in the physical space) to the limit-state surface. The design point P* belongs to the limit-state surface such as [beta] - [absolute value of OP *]. In this paper, only positive values for [beta] are considered, which means that the mean value point belongs to the safety domain. An approximated value of [P.sub.f] is thus deduced from [beta]: 
		 [P.sub.f] [equivalent] [PHI](-[beta]) (9) 
		 where [PHI] is the cumulative distribution function of the centered and reduced normal law. This leads to approximate the limit state surface by the hyperplane tangent to the limit state surface at the point P *. 
		 * First Order Reliability Method coupled with a Response Surface Method (FORM-RSM) [41,42]: The limit state function G([??], t) is approximated by a polynomial function [bar.G] of degree two without crossed terms. Coefficients of [bar.G] are determined to minimize the approximation error around the design point P *. They are assessed using least square minimizations for a number of appropriate vectors [??]. In this paper, as proposed by Bucher [43], these vectors are chosen according to a "star" experimental design. 
		 * Importance Sampling Monte Carlo simulations (MCIS): This method is used in order to validate the two previous simplified reliability approaches, FORM and FORM-RSM. This is based on a sampling concentrated around the design point P*. In this paper, 10,000 simulations were performed. In comparison with crude Monte Carlo simulations, MCIS is more efficient and limits the number of drawings. Nevertheless, if the design point P* determined by the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) is not correct, the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations performed around this point do not allow to fairly evaluate the failure probability [P.sub.f]. In addition to the [P.sub.f] value, MCIS provide an estimation of the variability of this value. If this is too large, 10,000 supplementary simulations are performed until obtaining a satisfactory variability. The accuracy of this method can be estimated by the [P.sub.f] due to the calculation method. 
		 Each of these methods is independently applied for each time of calculation in order to express reliability information according to time. This approach is satisfactory [44] since the failure function G continuously decreases over time and the random vector [??] remains time-independent (no aging effect or kinetics are taken into account). 
		 The reliability calculations are solved using two toolboxes ReliabTbx [45] (FORM-RSM calculations) and FERUM [46] (MCIS and FORM calculations) implemented in MATLAB[R] language environment. 
		 In the following the authors will not reason in terms of failure probability [P.sub.f] but in terms of reliability index [beta] by considering its evolution as a function of the time. On the whole, they will use the expression "[beta]-" to address results relative to the reliability index (e.g. [beta]-curves, [beta]-value, etc.). 
		 The final objective is to calculate a reliability service life (SL), which means the identification of a threshold value for [beta]. It corresponds to the criterion for the end of service life ([[beta].sub.lim]). [[beta].sub.lim] must be chosen independent of the material and structural parameters, as well as of the boundary conditions. Previous studies in the literature [16,20,45,47,48] consider a time-independent value. In contrast, the authors have adopted a function of time in agreement with the annex C of EN 1990 [49].Thus, [[beta].sup.[tau].sub.lim] is determined at time [tau] using the following relation: 
		 [PHI]([[beta].sup.[tau].sub.lim) = [[[PHI](1.5)].sup.[tau]/50] (10) 
		 In a systematic way, the reliability SL [T.sub.SL] is defined as the time when [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]. Using Eq. (10), [[beta].sub.lim] is equal to 1.5, 1.304 and 1.024 (corresponding to failure probabilities 7,10 and 16%, respectively) at 50, 100 and 120 years, respectively. In comparison, the previous studies performed by Deby et al. [16] and Muigay et al. [20] are consistent with this approach since they consider [[beta].sub.lim] = 1.5 for a targeted service life of 50 years. 
		 3.2. Sensitivity analysis 
		 Previously different sensitivity analyses [22,45,50-54] have been previously performed on predictive durability models. Nevertheless, in case of chloride ingress models, some limitations are observed: the variability of input data is not considered, no comparison of models has been performed and a limited number of cementitious materials have been tested. 
		 In this paper, a sensitivity analysis is carried out in the framework of the reliability approach, in order to improve our comprehension of the studied models, the major mechanisms and the significance of each input data. This is accomplished at the reliability SL [T.sub.SL] and based on two sensitivity indicators. 
		 Firstly, the direction cosine [[alpha].sub.i] represents the global influence of the random variable [U.sub.i] over the limit-state, and thus the response of the reliability model: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (11) 
		 where [u.sub.i] and [??]* are the realization of [U.sub.i] and the vector of the design point coordinates in the standardized Gaussian space, respectively. In practice, the direction cosine informs on the global influence of the associated input data on the reliability calculation, without making a distinction between its mean value and its standard deviation. By definition, [[alpha].sub.i] checks the following equality: [SIGMA] [[alpha].sup.2.sub.i] = 1. Consequently, the interpretation of results is simplified using [[alpha].sup.2.sub.i] due to the normalization of the contribution of each individual input data. 
		 Secondly, to achieve a more comprehensive approach, the influence of the values for the mean value and standard deviation can be studied separately using the elasticity coefficients. The elasticity [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] with respect to the reliability parameter [p.sub.i] of the random variable [X.sub.i] is defined as: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (12) 
		 Regarding the mean value, if the elasticity [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] of variable [X.sub.i] is close to zero, this signifies that a variation of the mean value does not influence the reliability result, and thus an approximated value can be chosen. Thus, the analysis of [PROGRAM LISTING NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] responds quantitatively to the need to limit expensive experimental tests by pointing out input data for which only the order of magnitude is necessary. In contrast, a high value for [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] implies that the associated mechanism related to the variable [X.sub.i] plays a significant role in durability prediction. 
		 The elasticity [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] with respect to the standard deviation of [X.sub.i] can be interpreted as follows. If [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] is close to zero, the variable [X.sub.i] can be considered as deterministic compared to the other variables. In contrast, if its value is high, it is necessary to limit the scatter of the associated variable [X.sub.i] in order to achieve the expected long-term durability performance. 
		 4. Studied materials 
		 Concretes and mortars [55-58] ranging from low-grade to high-performance materials, and with or without supplementary cementitious materials, are studied (see Table 2). All materials have already been characterized from the point of view of the microstructure, transport and chemical properties. The type of the probabilistic distribution (including deterministic input data), mean value, and the coefficient of variation are presented in Table 2 and explained in the following. 
		 For the concrete cover thickness, the critical content of chloride, the porosity and the effective chloride diffusion coefficient, the authors have selected probabilistic distributions previously proposed in the literature [16,23,37,59]. Due to a lack of literature data, for the parameters [mu], K and [C.sub.ads] of the Freundlich, linear and Kari isotherms, respectively, as well as for the initial concentrations of alkali ([K.sup.+] and [Na.sup.+]) and hydroxyl ions, a log-normal distribution with a coefficient of variation equal to 20% is systematically chosen. As the parameter y of the Freundlich isotherm is defined between 0 and 1, a normal distribution with a coefficient of variation equal to 20% and truncated in the range [0 1 ] is used. Other initial ion concentrations ([Cl.sup.-], S[O.sup.2-.sub.4], [Mg.sup.2+], [Ca.sup.2+] and [H.sup.+]) are considered deterministic to simplify the calculations. Moreover, ion concentrations in seawater (i.e. the boundary conditions) are chosen deterministic since the seawater in contact with the concrete specimens can be seen as an infinite reservoir with constant chemical composition. 
		 The mean or deterministic values of the input data are presented in Table 2. The porosity [phi] is determined by hydrostatic weighing according to the French Standard NF PI 8-459 and the effective chloride diffusion coefficient [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] is calibrated by inverse analysis carried out on total chloride contents (tcc) profiles [25]. 
		 For all materials (except concretes M75SF and M120SF), these tcc profiles are the results of a diffusion test performed in the laboratory on water-saturated samples [26,28,55,57,58]. In case of the two high performance concretes M75SF and M120SF, they are assessed on concrete specimens placed in a tidal zone [56].The Freundlich parameters (see Table 2) are calibrated for the concretes M25, BO and M30FA on experimental tcc and free chloride concentration (fee) profiles [26] (note that the difference between tcc and fee profiles enables to assess the binding). In case of the other studied materials, the Freundlich parameters are only assessed by numerical inverse analysis of experimental tcc profiles [25] (due to a lack of more complete experimental data). For the linear and Kari isotherms, the mean values of K and [C.sub.ads] are calibrated using a least-square method and ensuring that the obtained CBI is the closest as possible to the Freundlich isotherm constructed using the mean values of [mu] and [gamma]. The aim is to keep a consistent description between the studied CBI models. Finally, boundary and initial conditions have to be specified. Ion concentrations for a seawater with a salinity equal to 35 g/L [60] are chosen as boundary conditions. For the initial concentration of the pore solution, experimental values previously published in the literature are used [61,62]. 
		 The threshold total chloride content [n.sub.th] involves numerous influencing parameters which lead to a high random nature. Values proposed by Polder [37] are chosen: a log-normal distribution with a mean value equal to 0.5% of mass of binder and a high coefficient of variation equal to 44%. This choice is more conservative than the distributions proposed in the DuraCrete project [23] and the fib model code [39]. 
		 According to EN 1992-1-1 [1], it is common to prescribe a concrete cover thickness of 0.05 m. For comparison purpose this value is selected whatever the studied material. A classical statistical distribution is used for the concrete cover depth e, i.e. a log-normal law with a coefficient of variation equal to 20% [16,23], For a mean value of 0.05 m, this corresponds to a standard deviation of 0.01 m. 
		 5. Results 
		 In this section, the vector [??] of independent random variables as defined in Eq. (6) is considered. The correlation effects between [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] and CBI parameters will be investigated in Section 5.4. 
		 5.1. Validation of the probabilistic approach 
		 Probabilistic calculations need to be verified. The models used in the present paper are classified in the following ascending order of approximation: MCIS, FORM and FORM-RSM. Thus, as soon as the MCIS model is verified, it will be used to check the two other models. 
		 For each determined failure probability [P.sub.f] as calculated by MCIS, an estimation of its coefficient of variation ([c.sub.v]) is calculated as provided by Lemaire [40]. Whatever the considered models, the studied materials or the calculation time, it has been verified that [c.sub.v] remains less than 3% (for 10000 simulations). This confirms the relevance of the calculations provided by MCIS. 
		 [beta]-values determined by FORM and FORM-RSM are checked using MCIS results and Eq. (7) (to convert [P.sub.f] into [beta]). For concretes M75SF, M120SF and Mo2, the three calculation methods, MCIS, FORM and FORM-RSM are compared in Fig. 1 which shows a qualitative consistency with each other. The coefficient of determination [R.sup.2] [63] can be used to assess quantitatively the accuracy of approximated [beta]-curves (FORM or FORM-RSM) with respect to MCIS. If the value of [R.sup.2] is close to 1, an approximated [beta]-curve is satisfactory. In case of unsatisfactory results using FORM-RSM ([R.sup.2]  0.98), calculations of the reliability index using FORM are considered. This strategy enables to limit the computation time. 
		 5.2. Service life prediction 
		 Fig. 2 illustrates [beta]-curves for M75SF, M120SF and Mo2. The four chloride ingress models, Erf, MIl_Fre, MS5_Fre and MS8JK_act are compared. [[beta].sub.lim] according to EN 1990 [49] is illustrated in black dotted lines in order to determine the reliability SL (see method described in Section 3.1). The determined [beta]-curves are clearly different according to the considered chloride ingress model. 
		 A first point of explanation relies on the number of probabilized input data. Indeed, the addition of input data as random variables increases the level of uncertainty and leads to a logical reduction in the calculated [beta]-values. An example can perfectly illustrate this effect. Let's consider the models Erf and MI1_Fre which differ in terms of CBI but are similar regarding the description of ion transport. The Freundlich isotherm (used in model MI1_Fre) can transform into a linear one (thus corresponding to the model Erf) if the value of parameter y is close to 1 (see concretes M75SF and M120SF). Therefore for the same material, predicted tcc profiles are similar. Nevertheless, a minimal difference exists between the [beta]-curves. Since the model MI1_Fre considers two variables for the description of the CBI instead of one for Erf, MI1_Fre leads to lower [beta]-values. 
		 Moreover, discrepancies can be explained by physical and chemical considerations. Models MI1_Fre and MS5_Fre adopt the same CBI (Freundlich isotherm) but differ in terms of transport description. A multi-species transport (MS5_Fre) modeling means a concerted movement of ions, i.e. ions with a high diffusion coefficient ([OH.sup.-] and [H.sup.+]) are slowed down; in contrast, transport of ions with a low diffusion coefficient ([Na.sup.+], [K.sup.+] and ([Cl.sup.-]) are accelerated. Thus, chloride ingress is accelerated by using model MS5_Fre in comparison with model MIl_Fre [14] and [beta]-values for the multispecies model are reduced in comparison with the mono-ionic model. 
		 The interpretation of results obtained with model MS8_K_act remains tricky since it differs from other models both in CBI and transport descriptions. The resulting concerted movement of the main eight ions dissolved in seawater leads to chloride diffusion similar to the case of single ion diffusion. But, as detailed by Pradelle et al. [25], the competitive ion adsorption on the solid matrix corresponding to model MS8_K_act leads to an unusual shape of the CBI. For high fee the content of bound chloride ions falls drastically illustrating a severe competitive adsorption between ions. This has a direct impact on the shape of the simulated tcc profiles (see the presence of a bell shape in the vicinity of the surface for instance [25]). 
		 Considering the methodology described in Section 3.1, the reliability SL [T.sub.SL] is assessed. Table 3 resumes the results obtained for the different studied models and materials. Furthermore, the deterministic SL using the mean value of the vector [??] (i.e. SL corresponds to [beta] = 0) and the expected SL according to the performance-based approach (Perf.) are reported. The performance-based approach used by Baroghel et al. [64] to assess the SL relies on durability performances to be achieved in terms of durability indicators (Dis) which can be easily assessed in laboratory by means of direct measurements. Regarding chloride ingress, Baroghel et al. consider the porosity and the apparent diffusion coefficient as Dis (see Table 2). The choice of an apparent diffusion coefficient is justified by the facility to measure it with respect to the effective diffusion coefficient. The advantage of the apparent diffusion coefficient is also its capacity to encompass both transport phenomena and binding effects. 
		 Deterministic SL values based on mean values are logically higher than those obtained with probabilistic calculations due to the consideration of uncertainties. Deterministic [T.sub.SL] is in general classified in the following increasing order for a given concrete: MS5_Fre, MS8_K_act, MI1_Fre and Erf. The ranking of reliability [T.sub.SL] is slightly different: MS5_Fre, MI1_Fre, MS8_K_act and Erf. This discrepancy emphasizes the role of the number of input data considered as random variables (6 for MI1_Fre and 8 for MS8_K_act). On the whole, these results are consistent with the previous analysis of the ranking of [beta]-curves (see Fig. 2). 
		 Whatever the considered model, a ranking of predicted (deterministic or reliability) [T.sub.SL] can also be determined for the six studied concretes (increasing order): M25, BO, M30FA, C1, M75SF and M120SF. Even if this ranking is consistent with the performance-based approach, predicted values are shorter. There are two plausible explanations: 
		 * in the framework of the performed calculations of reliability [T.sub.SL], the description of the initiation of corrosion is skewed by significant uncertainties due to a lack of scientific knowledge on the actual extent of the dispersions of input data. This leads to arbitrarily fixing of the scattering of some variables. Furthermore, the description of the initiation of corrosion, based on a single parameter [n.sub.th], is clearly not relevant for SL calculations and might lead to underestimation due to the chosen high variability (standard deviation of 44%). 
		 * in case of reliability [T.sub.SL] calculations, since a threshold reliability index [[beta].sub.lim] as a function of time is chosen, it leads to a reduced [T.sub.SL] in comparison with previous studies using a fixed threshold, whatever the targeted service life [16,20,45]. 
		 Moreover, a conservative approach has been assumed in this paper since the propagation period of corrosion is not taken into account in the calculation of [T.sub.SL]. This is an acknowledged shortfall (also present in the performance-based approach) since, during a part of the propagation period, damages remain limited and RC structures continue to be functional for their intended use. This should be taken into account when comparing the present study and observations carried out on real RC structures made of the same materials. 
		 In spite of abnormally low [T.sub.SL] calculated for most of the studied materials, the simulations remain relevant from a strict concrete point of view and for the purpose of a sensitivity analysis. 
		 5.3. Reliability sensitivity analysis 
		 The reliability sensitivity analysis is only carried out at [T.sub.SL]. This is relevant in view of the fact that durability models are used to predict [T.sub.SL] and that designers want to know the most influencing input data in terms of mean value and variability of the studied input data for this specific value. Firstly, a global analysis is performed using the direction cosines [alpha]. Thereafter, a more precise analysis is carried out using the elasticities with respect to the mean and the standard deviation. 
		 5.3.1. Direction cosines [alpha] 
		 Fig. 3 illustrates the square of the direction cosines [[alpha].sup.2] obtained for each set of statistical input data in case of the four studied models. Considering each predictive model and each input data [X.sub.i], no clear trend is observed between the different cementitious materials (see that the variability of [[alpha].sup.2] is illustrated by a high coefficient of variation around 20%). Similarly, no clear influence of the level of modeling refinement can be found. Thus the following sensitivity analysis will be valid whatever the model and the concrete. 
		 Globally, the comparison of the various input data reveals that a maximum for [[alpha].sup.2] is obtained for the concrete cover thickness e (60-70% on average) and the critical chloride content [n.sub.th] (20-30% on average). Nevertheless, no conclusion can be drawn to distinguish between e and [n.sub.th], the most influencing input data since in some cases [[alpha].sup.2] values are of the same order of magnitude, or even [[alpha].sup.2] ([n.sub.th]) can be higher than [[alpha].sup.2] (e). 
		 Among the other input data linked to the concrete properties, only [[alpha].sup.2] related to the effective chloride diffusion coefficient [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] and the power coefficient [gamma] of the Freundlich isotherm are significantly different from 0. As a whole, it confirms that [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] is a key input data among the concrete properties. 
		 Now let's have a look more specifically at the influencing role of the CBI parameters. K and [C.sub.ads] (used in models Erf and MS8_K_act, respectively) represent the slope of the CBI (the Kari model is almost linear [25]). Their [[alpha].sup.2] values are close to 0. Regarding the models MI1_Fre and MS5_Fre, the chosen Freundlich description corresponds to a two-parameter CBI, i.e. [mu] is linked to the slope from the origin while [gamma] expresses the non-linear nature of the CBI. [[alpha].sup.2] ([gamma]) is higher than [[alpha].sup.2] values associated with the other input data characterizing chloride binding. As the Freundlich description remains empirical, such results are difficult to interpret with physical or chemical arguments. Nonetheless, it seems to correspond to the chosen significant variability of parameter [gamma] which is based on a previous study performed by the present authors [25], Due to several numerical calibrations of CBI parameters performed for a large panel of concretes, the authors have indeed shown that [gamma] is randomly distributed between 0.2 and 1.0 with no clear ranking according to the kind of concrete. It confirms the difficulty to use this parameter for a consistent description of the CBI. 
		 Also other input data related to concrete properties exist and are considered as random variables, i.e. the porosity, and the initial alkali and hydroxyl concentrations. Their [[alpha].sup.2] values are close to 0. Therefore, no advanced knowledge of these input data (e.g. mechanical pore solution extraction in order to determine initial alkali and hydroxyl concentrations) is required to accurately predict [T.sub.SL]. 
		 A comparative study with results previously published in the literature can now be conducted. In general, sensitivity analyses were performed in case of analytical chloride ingress models (derived from the error function) [22,52,54], except the paper of Conciatori et al. [51] (multi-species model STADIUM[R]). The results of these papers are consistent with each other: the concrete cover thickness and the critical chloride content are the key input data to predict the SL of RC structures immersed in seawater. Let's note that Saassouh and Lounis [22] consider a low standard deviation (20%) for the critical chloride content, and thus find a limited impact on the SL prediction. 
		 For the input data linked to the concrete properties, the most influencing input data is the apparent chloride diffusion coefficient which encompasses both transport phenomena and binding effects. By comparison, regarding the chloride ingress models studied in the present paper, the effective chloride diffusion coefficient [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] is a key input data among the studied concrete properties whereas the influence of the binding parameters seems to be limited. 
		 5.3.2. Elasticity with respect to the mean value [[epsilon].sub.m] 
		 The comparison between elasticities with respect to the mean value of each input data [X.sub.i] is shown in Fig. 4. As mentioned in the previous section dealing with direction cosines, for each input data [X.sub.i], no clear trend appears with respect to the studied concretes and the kind of model. Nevertheless, some discussions remain common to the four studied chloride ingress models. 
		 The elasticity of the concrete cover thickness [[epsilon].sub.m](e) is between 1.4 and 3.6. A clear distinction between [[epsilon].sub.m](e) and [[epsilon].sub.m]([n.sub.th]) is noticed ([[epsilon].sub.m]([n.sub.th]) is between 0.3 and 1.7). This confirms the crucial role of these two input data in the calculation of [beta]. 
		 As a second step, a focus on the input data related to solely the concrete properties can be made. [[epsilon].sub.m]([MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) is between 0.5 and 1.5 which represents the same order of magnitude as [[epsilon].sub.m]([n.sub.th]). This reinforces the idea that chloride ingress is mainly controlled by transport phenomena. [[epsilon].sub.m]([phi]) is negligible whatever the type of concrete and model suggesting that an approximated value can be chosen for this parameter. This is in line with the principle of an a priori assessment based on models or the use of approximated relationships. For instance usual relationships between compressive strength and porosity [65] could be useful. 
		 Furthermore, Fig. 4 allows an analysis of the influence of the CBI descriptions. Considering the input data linked to the slope of the CBI (K, [mu] and [C.sub.ads], the elasticities with respect to the mean stay in the same order of magnitude (between 0.01 and 0.3). Like for the porosity, these low values of [[epsilon].sub.m] indicate a limited influence of these input data and allow to consider as assessment of first order. Among others, two methods for determination of K, [mu] and [C.sub.ads] seem possible. On the one hand, the analytical formula proposed by Baroghel-Bouny et al. [26] can be used, where the binding capacity is directly related to the content of C-S-H, residual aluminates [C.sub.3]A and [C.sub.4]AF. On the other hand, values proposed by Pradelle et al. [25] for a large range of cementitious materials can be employed. Note that in the specific case of the Freundlich description, most weight is observed on the parameter [gamma] ([[epsilon].sub.m]([gamma]) is between 0.088 and 0.85). This confirms the observation made in Section 5.3.1 based on the analysis of the direction cosines. 
		 Considering the two multi-species models (MS5_Fre and MS8_K_act), [[epsilon].sub.m] values for the initial concentrations of alkali and hydroxyl ions are close to 0. Initial concentrations of these ions can thus be determined using approximate hydration models or assessed using analogies with similar concretes since the low level of accuracy for these methods does not impair the ability of the used chloride ingress models to predict [T.sub.SL]. This statement confirms a posteriori the choice made in Section 4 to consider initial ion concentrations by comparison with similar concretes. 
		 5.3.3. Elasticity with respect to the standard deviation [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]] 
		 The elasticities [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]]([X.sub.i]) with respect to the standard deviation of each input data [X.sub.i] are illustrated in Fig. 5. As described in the previous discussion about the direction cosines and the elasticities with respect to the mean values, [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]] seems to be independent of the type of concrete and/or used model. Again, the standard deviations of e and [n.sub.th] play a crucial role in the assessment of [beta]: the mean value of [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]](e) and [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]](nth) are in the range of 0.65 and 0.4, respectively. 
		 The influence of the standard deviation of the other input data is weak in comparison to those of e and [n.sub.th]. In case of input data linked to transport properties, [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] and [phi], [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]] values are close to 0. [phi] can thus be considered as deterministic. Regarding [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII], the calculated results highlight a weak influence of its standard deviation; it suggests not to pursue an exact determination of its statistical distribution and the one chosen in the present paper seems relevant (log-normal and 10% as a coefficient of variation). 
		 Let us focus now on input data describing the interactions between the chloride ions and the solid matrix. In spite of arbitrarily high coefficients of variation (20%), all [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]] related to the input data representing the slope of CBI (K, [C.sub.ads] and [mu]) are negligible, which encourages not to go further in the determination of their statistical distributions as well. In case of the models MI1_Fre and MS5_Fre, the most significant variable in terms of [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]] is [gamma]. Globally, its influence seems even higher than [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] but lower than e and [n.sub.th]. This highlights again that the chosen important variability of this input data has an impact on the calculated [beta], i.e. an essential role among the input data linked to the concrete properties. 
		 [[epsilon].sub.[sigma]] values for initial alkali and hydroxyl ions have been determined; they are close to 0. These three concentrations can then be defined as deterministic. Such results confirm the arbitrary hypothesis to define their statistical distribution as log-normal with a coefficient of variation of 20%. This choice seems not to influence the SL prediction. 
		 5.4. Influence of the correlation 
		 The possible influence of some correlation coefficients is evaluated in this section. This is relevant because it is likely that DIs and main properties of concrete are correlated [66], For this purpose, the following strategy is adopted. In case of models Erf and MI1_Fre, results in terms of [beta]-curves and direction cosines are compared according to two scenarios: the vector [??] is an independent random vector (scenario called "Independent") or the correlation coefficients r([MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) = 0.7, r([phi], CBI) = -0.7 and r([MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII], CBI) = -0.7 are introduced (scenario called "r([MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII], CBI)"). CBI means the parameters K or [mu] of the linear and Freundlich isotherms, depending on the considered model. Due to a lack of experimental data, the authors have arbitrarily chosen for a correlation coefficient of 0.7 since this value is sufficiently high to potentially influence the reliability calculation. A negative sign for the correlation coefficient means that the influence of the variables is opposite. 
		 Whatever the considered scenarios (independent or with correlations), almost identical [beta]-curves are determined (see Fig. 2). Thus, taking into account the correlation coefficient among [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII], [phi] and CBI does not modify the reliability [T.sub.SL] prediction. 
		 It is however possible that the introduced correlation coefficients modify the sensitivity analysis conclusions. To simply discuss this issue, the comparison between an independent and a correlated vector [??] in terms of direction cosines is performed in Fig. 6. Remarks for the models Erf and MI1_Fre can be pointed out. Unexpectedly, all the input data can be impacted by the introduced correlations, and not only those which are correlated. Nevertheless, in most cases, these changes do not modify the relative influence of each input data. Whatever the scenario, the concrete cover thickness and the critical chloride content remain to be the key input data. Globally, for other input data, the orders of magnitude for [[alpha].sup.2.sib.i] remain much lower than those of e and [n.sub.th]. 
		 The authors recall that in case of independent variables, [[alpha].sup.2]([phi]) is close to 0 and [[alpha].sup.2]([MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) is low but not negligible. The introduction of correlation conducts to an increase of the weight of [phi] to reach that of [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]. Dealing with the CBI parameters, [[alpha].sup.2] values evolves as follows: [[alpha].sup.2]([gamma]) is significantly different from 0, but still remaining well below [[alpha].sup.2](e) and [[alpha].sup.2]([n.sub.th]); [[alpha].sup.2](K) and [[alpha].sup.2]([mu]) values (already low for independent variables) decreases for the scenario r([MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII], CBI). 
		 This discussion globally highlights the weak effect of correlations on the sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, this study remains limited and does not allow global conclusions to be drawn. 
		 6. Conclusions 
		 A sensitivity analysis of chloride ingress models for RC structures immersed in seawater has been performed in the framework of a reliability approach, i.e. the variabilities of the input data are taken into account. A methodology for a probabilistic service life (SL) prediction has been presented. 
		 Once the adopted reliability approach has been verified, the authors have estimated the SL of a set of concretes and mortars, and compared the results with deterministic calculations and the values obtained by the performance approach based on the use of durability indicators. The calculated reliability SL [T.sub.SL] is shorter than the one assessed by using the performance-based approach of durability. This is partly due to the definition of [[beta].sub.lim], as a time-dependent function. Two biases in the methodology have also been identified: the standard deviation of the concrete cover has been chosen quite high as well as the one of the chloride threshold for corrosion initiation. Moreover, the chosen conservative modeling does not consider the propagation of corrosion. These elements represent perspectives to improve the methodology to calculate [T.sub.SL]. 
		 A sensitivity analysis has been performed using three different indicators: the direction coefficients, the elasticities with respect to the mean value and the standard deviation. The following conclusions are drawn: 
		 * The study confirms that the key input data to predict the SL of RC structures immersed in seawater are clearly the concrete cover thickness and the critical chloride content. It is thus important to define with enough accuracy the mean value and the coefficient of variation of these input data since the determination of the reliability index [beta] mainly depends on these two input data. 
		 * The mean value of the effective chloride diffusion coefficient has a similar influence than the critical chloride content, which confirms the key role of diffusion phenomena in the chloride ingress process in comparison to binding capacity of the matrix. Nevertheless, even if the studied concretes belong to a broad range, the role of binding characteristics could be stronger if concretes blended with a very high content of supplementary cementitious materials were considered. 
		 * In contrast, approximated values can be chosen for the porosity, input data related to the slope from the origin of the CBI (for instance coefficient /i for Freundlich description) and the initial concentrations of alkali and hydroxyl ions. They can be determined by analogy with similar materials or by using easy-to-use analytical formula or models. However, regarding the initial concentrations within the concrete, the conclusions will have to be confirmed for materials which intrinsically contain a high content of chloride ions, e.g. concretes mixed with cement containing blast furnace slag. The importance of the initial chloride concentration may prove not to be negligible. 
		 * The elasticities with respect to the standard deviation indicate that the porosity, the initial concentration of alkali and hydroxyl ions within the concrete can be considered as deterministic. For other input data, the effective chloride diffusion coefficient and input data linked to the slope of CBIs, approximate statistical distributions are adequate. 
		 * The practical use of the Freundlich description of the concrete binding isotherm turns out to be complex due to the high level of uncertainty which still relies on the power coefficient and the relative weight of this input data in the assessment of SL. Thus, the use of a Freundlich description, as a global approximation of physical and chemical interactions between ions and solid matrix, will generate too high uncertainties in the durability prediction of RC structures as long as its scattering cannot be sufficiently controlled. This leads to consider a single parameter CBI as the most relevant way to address chloride binding modeling in order to make a better management of uncertainty possible. 
		 * The last part of the present paper has dealt with the introduction of correlation coefficients between the porosity, the effective chloride diffusion coefficient and the slope of the chloride binding isotherm. The authors have observed no significant influence of correlation effects on reliability SL predictions. Adding correlations between input data just seems to modify the influence of input data but in a moderate way. More investigations are however needed to confirm these results. 
		 These conclusions can be summarized as follows: the concrete cover depth, the critical chloride content and the effective chloride diffusion coefficient are crucial parameters. This may lead to consider a simple model based on Fick's second law for the description of chloride penetration in immersed concrete. Nevertheless, it is necessary to bear in mind that only chloride content profiles are probably not sufficient to predict SL because, as recalled in the paper and even if not yet really well established, the propagation of corrosion is certainly highly controlled by the presence of other species like hydroxyl and alkali ions. This consideration simply points out the benefits of more sophisticated models than those based on the mono-diffusion Fick approach. 
		 In the literature, chloride ingress models developed for saturated conditions are often used for high performance concretes placed in tidal zone. It would be interesting to expand the conclusions of the present study for these kinds of concrete which remain closely saturated. 
		 All these conclusions allow a deeper understanding of chloride ingress models since a robust framework has been proposed for reliability service life calculations. The sensitivity analysis quantifies the influence of each input data (mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficient) and enables to identify the input data which necessitate a thorough management of their uncertainties. This finally allows to propose relevant and robust tools to predict SL but also a strategy to limit expensive experimental tests, necessary to determine input data.

		 This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. 
		 Appendix A. Description of ion adsorption onto C-S-H 
		 Table 4 summarizes the considered equations describing the competitive adsorption onto solid matrix. The authors add the hypothesis that the capacity of solid matrix to adsorb is constant for all ions. Constants of adsorption reaction are assumed to be equal to those of adsorption reactions onto C-S-H. Such hypothesis is also used by other authors [10,67). Thus, analytical relationships (see Eqs. (13) and (14)) between the content of bound ions and the free concentration of ions can be written. First, let us note D as: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (13) 
		 Analytical relationships are then: 
		 [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] (14) 
		 where the parameter [C.sub.ads] (-) has to be calibrated. [MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] are the bound content (mol/[m.sup.3]) of hydroxyl, chloride, calcium, sulfate, sodium, and potassium ions, respectively. 
		 HIGHLIGHTS 
		 * A reliability sensitivity analysis of chloride ingress models is performed. 
		 * A framework is proposed to calculate a reliability service life for RC structures. 
		 * The concrete cover thickness and the critical chloride content play a crucial role. 
		 * To a lesser extent, the effective chloride diffusion coefficient is influential. 
		 * The Freundlich description of chloride binding is difficult to use.

		 ABSTRACT 
		 A new monitoring approach was developed to enhance the analysis of performance tests and provide new sulfate resistance criteria. Even in the case of low degradation rates or non-swelling materials exposed to external sulfate attacks, the method allows detecting microscopic evolutions via a set of easily accessible monitored parameters. The monitoring has been performed on a set of sulfate-resisting and non sulfateresisting cement-based mortars. The main phenomena induced by external sulfate attack are leaching, precipitation, aggregates loss and cracking. Based on the monitoring of mass, hydrostatic weighing, elongation and the amount of leached O[H.sup.-] the method provides the samples dimensional variations, the volume and mass changes of minerals and free water, corresponding to the main phenomena of the external sulfate attack. On the one hand, the phenomena decoupling allows a better understanding of the sulfate attack mechanism. The observed equivalence between the volumes of leached and precipitated products highlights the influence of portlandite, the major leached mineral, on the precipitation mechanism. The precipitation-deformation correlation and the samples absolute deformation monitoring showed a common expansion mechanism for the different cement compositions. The cement type was found to influence the magnitude of deformations. On the other hand, the determination of the volume variations corresponding to each phenomenon allows the proposition of new performance indicators from the monitoring approach outputs: the averaged density, the deformation path and the expansion potential. The three indicators were sensitive to the microstructural and macroscopic evolutions. The expansion potential, related to crystallization pressure, was found to depend on cement composition.

		 1. Introduction 
		 External sulfate attacks are caused by the ingress of sulfate ions from the environment. They result in an increase in porosity, local expansion and cracking. As a consequence the mechanical properties and the durability of cement-based materials are affected [28,23], Sulfate attacks have been taken into account in the design of concrete mixtures since the 1920s and the first standards on cement. The so-called "sulfate resisting" cements have generally shown good behaviour on site, as very few cases of external sulfate attacks have been reported. However the composition of cements has been changing for the last decades, in order to design more sustainable construction products. Changes in clinker content or chemical composition are likely to affect the sulfate resistance of cement-based materials [14], A good understanding of the mechanism of degradation, reliable tests, and relevant indicators are thus needed to assess the durability of new cements and concrete exposed to external sulfate attacks. 
		 The mechanism of degradation of cement-based materials is now relatively well known [12,15], The ingress of external sulfate solution modifies the chemical equilibrium between solid phases and interstitial solution in the cementitious matrix [7,10,24], The increase of sulfate concentration in interstitial solution results in the formation of ettringite (or alumino ferrite trisubstituted AFt) from monosulfoaluminate 2Ca0[Al.sub.2] [O.sub.3] [Ca.sub.2] S[O.sub.4] 12[H.sub.2] 0 (alumino ferrite monosubstituted AFm). Expansion is normally associated to ettringite formation [19,18], even gypsum formation could lead to samples swelling [16], The theory that is consistent with most of experiments and observations is the crystal growth pressure. The crystal growth theory describes the crystallization pressure produced by supersaturation and confinement [8,9,27]. According to this theory, the driving force for the crystallization pressure is the supersaturation of the pore solution with respect to ettringite. The formation of ettringite does not necessarily result in expansion or damage. This is supported by numerous field observations in the past in which no correlation between the amount of formed ettringite and observed expansion. Significant expansion pressure higher than tensile strength can only be exerted by ettringite which forms in small pores within a certain size range [9], approximately 10-50 nm, depending on the cement used. Microstructural studies [3] showed that penetrating sulfates first react with monosulfate in pockets which does not lead to stress or expansion. On depletion of the pockets content, monosulfate which is finely intermixed in C-S-H then reacts to form expansive ettringite. The scenario of sulfate attack scenario has been confirmed by the zonation observed on damaged samples [1,21], These experimental results confirmed that sulfate attack do not only cause expansion but also softening and decohesion. The formation of gypsum and ettringite requires a source of calcium. Calcium can be provided by the leaching of portlandite and C-S-H. The leaching of the portlandite and the progressive decalcification of C-S-H cause a softening of cement matrix and a decrease of strength [4]. 
		 Performance-based specifications and methodologies of qualification of cement-based materials are often associated to testing procedures. Laboratory conditions should be representative of field exposure. The typical concentration in sulfate-rich environments is 0.02-3 g/L. Concrete structures are partially or fully saturated, or exposed to drying and wetting cycles [9,1,13]. Previous studies have also shown the influence of counter ions, temperature, and pH control. New experimental procedures have been developed to provide more representative sulfate resistance tests [5,22]. 
		 Most of performance tests and criteria are based on length measurements and expansion limits (ASTM C 1012, 2000). Expansion data do not provide enough information to assess the chemical reactions and understand the mechanisms causing damage. Moreover, expansion can be caused by other phenomena [29], and the phenomena occurring during the first stage of sulfate attack do not result in significant expansion [21,25]. 
		 This paper presents a new monitoring approach aimed at enhancing performance tests and criteria. Based on some relatively accessible monitoring parameters such as mass, leaching, and hydrostatic weighing, we deduced the mass and volume variations associated to chemical changes and cracking to monitor sulfate attack. The results of this analysis were directly used to define new performance indicators to assess the durability of the new construction materials. This new approach could be the way to correlate the chemical and mechanical evolutions and expansion potential related to crystallization pressure development. 
		 2. Experimental program 
		 In order to develop a new sulfate attack monitoring strategy, a double purpose experimental study was designed to understand the scenario of sulfate attack and then find new monitoring parameters to improve existing performance tests and enhance their reliability and relevance. 
		 2.1. Materials and mixtures 
		 The compositions of cements used in the experimental study are given in Table 1. The NSR is a non sulfate resisting cement with a relatively high [C.sub.3] A content (6.4 %), the two others cements SR5 and SR3 comply with criteria on sulfate resisting cements with relatively low [C.sub.3] A contents, respectively 0.7 and 0.4%. 
		 A mortar mixture was designed (Table 2) by adapting the composition defined in EN 196 standard. The paste volume, i.e. the sum of water and cement volumes, was kept constant. The water-to-cement ratio was increased from 0.5 to 0.6. French standard sand (SNL, 0.08 mm--1.6 mm size), according to the norm EN 196-1, was used. It's natural siliceous sand with generally isometric and rounded particles shape [2]. 
		 Tests were performed on mortar cylindrical samples of 20-mm diameter and 160-mm length. Mortar samples were kept in mould for 48 h then in saturated limewater for 26 days before testing. Two samples were exposed to sulfate attack and two control samples from the same batch were immersed in tap water in order to deduce the influence of hydration on the parameters monitored during sulfate attack. This allows decoupling the hydration and sulfate attack phenomena. 
		 2.2. Laboratory conditions of sulfate attack 
		 The laboratory procedure (Fig. 1) consists in immersing the mortar samples in a 3 g/1 sulfate solution (S[O.sup.2-.sub.4] concentration) at controlled constant temperature (20 [degrees]C) and pH (7.5) [22], The pH control is made via nitric acid at 0.5 mol/1 added automatically to equilibrate the O[H.sup.-] leached from the cementitious matrix. The sulfate solution is changed every 20 ml of added acid. The temperature control is provided by a temperature-controlled liquid, which passes into the double-walled beakers containing samples. 
		 2.3. Monitored parameters 
		 After each renewal of sulfate solution, the same measurements were made on samples exposed to sulfate solution and control samples, namely: mass, length, and hydrostatic weighing (Fig. 2). Hydrostatic weighing was carried out on samples immersed in their solution. Then they were wiped until saturated surface dried (SSD) state to measure the mass. Finally the length was assessed using LVDT sensor and invar reference bar. The quantity of leached OH- ions was directly assessed from the cumulated volumes of acid added to control the pH of sulfate solution. 
		 2.4. Thermogravimetric analysis 
		 Thermogravimetry analyses (TGA) were carried out in a dry nitrogen atmosphere with a SETARAM analyser. The dry pastes were crushed to powders, and 90 [+ or -] 5 mg samples put in crucibles. The sample were heated from 20 to 1100[degrees]C at a constant rate of 10[degrees]C/min. To determine the portlandite mass proportions in the pastes, we applied tangent method [26], At 425-550 [degrees]C the portlandite decomposition occurs and the TGA slope changes due to the water loss from the portlandite. The deduced portlandite mass/volume in the paste is reported to the sample volume, according the paste proportion in the mortar samples (Table 2). 
		 3. Development of the monitoring strategy 
		 3.1. Principle of the method 
		 The four main phenomena involved in the external sulfate attack include precipitation and leaching of cementitious matrix minerals, aggregates loss and cracking. The parameters monitored at macroscopic and intermediate levels give the changes due to the phenomena assembled. For a better understanding of these 4 phenomena and their effect on the monitored parameters, a monitoring strategy and a new method of analysis were developed in order to dissociate the changes caused by each phenomenon. 
		 The monitoring strategy illustrated in Fig. 3 is limited to 4 monitoring parameters. Some are directly related to one of the four phenomena mentioned above and others are related to two or more of these phenomena. For example, the evolution of the mass is influenced by four phenomena. In case of compensation between gain and loss of mass caused by leaching and precipitation of minerals for example, the global mass variation is not significant. 
		 Taking into account the different levels of dependence illustrated in Fig. 3, the combinations between the different parameters established in the following section will allow solving the problem gradually and eventually quantify changes entrained by each phenomena on each monitoring parameter. Thus decoupling the four phenomena provides a description of the sulfate attack scenario and allows the definition performance-based specifications. 
		 3.2. Development of macroscopic evaluation 
		 The specimen volume and the cross section variation of the specimen can be deduced from three parameters of the monitoring strategy: the SSD mass, the hydrostatic weighing, and the length (Fig. 4). 
		 3.2.1. Determination of volume variations 
		 The mass monitoring (1) provides information on the overall change in the cement matrix in liquid phase (variation of pore water content due to the change in porosity and cracking) and solid phase (dissolution and precipitation of minerals). The hydrostatic weighing monitoring (2) reveals the variation of the solid phase of the cement matrix. 
		 M = [M.sub.sol] + [[rho].sub.water] X [V.sub.liq] (1) 
		 [P.sub.hyd] = [M.sub.sol] - [[rho].sub.water] X [V.sub.sol] (2) 
		 with M is the SSD mass [g], [P.sub.hyd] the hydrostatic weighing [g], [M.sub.sol] solid phase mass [g], [V.sub.sol] solid phase volume [mL], [V.sub.liq] , liquid phase volume [mL] and [[eho].sub.water] water density [g/mL]. 
		 Combining the two monitored parameters the water equivalent mass of the specimen (3) can be assessed as a function of time, then the global sample volume variation can be deduced from Eq. (4). 
		 M - [P.sub.hyd] = [[rho].sub.water] ([V.sub.liq] + [V.sub.sol]) = [[rho].sub.water] x [V.sub.t] (3) 
		 [DELTA]V x [[rho].sub.water] = [DELTA]M - [DELTA][P.sub.hyd] (4) 
		 3.2.2. Variations of cross section 
		 The relative variation of cross section radius is deduced from the relative elongation variation x and the relative volume variation z monitored during the test (5). 
		 y = [square root of 1+z/1+x]-1 (5) 
		 x = [DELTA]L/[L.sub.0], y = [DELTA]R/[R.sub.0] and z = [DELTA]V/[V.sub.0] with [V.sub.0] initial global volume, [L.sub.0] initial sample length, and [R.sub.0] initial radius of cross section. 
		 3.3. Development of microscopic evaluation 
		 3.3.1. Mass variation model 
		 The mass variation during the sulfate attack is due to the leaching and precipitation of minerals, the aggregates loss, and the infiltration of water in the cracks generated by crystallization pressures associated to the precipitation of expansive minerals. From experimentally collected data and other physical parameters the mass variation is calculated taking into account all mentioned phenomena in order to understand better the coupling of the phenomena during the sulfate attack mechanism. 
		 The following monitoring strategy is based on 3 monitored parameters (Fig. 5): mass, hydrostatic weighing, and leached [OH.sup.-]. The aim is to assess the microscopic changes corresponding to the phenomena involved in sulfate attack. 
		 The hydration of cement is not directly taken into account in the analysis. In order to decouple hydration from the four other phenomena mentioned before, the difference between the monitoring data from sulfate attack test and control samples immersed in tap water (where hydration is the main phenomenon taking place) is calculated. Thus we consider that sulfate attack will not change the hydration, which is a simplifying assumption. The hydration of the outer layer of samples in contact with sulfate solution is almost achieved during the curing phase; however the hydration effect on monitored data is due to its continuation in deeper zones. These zones are affected later by the aggressive sulfate solution, when their hydration is achieved. This makes the continuation of hydration almost the same for the attacked and control samples. 
		 Sulfate attack causes changes in the liquid and solid phase of the sample, which makes the mass variation depending on the variation of these two phases (6) respectively [DELTA][M.sub.water,poro] and [DELTA] [M.sub.sol]. 
		 [DELTA]M = [DELTA] [M.sub.water.poro] + [DELTA][M.sub.sol] (6) 
		 3.3.2. Variations of liquid phase 
		 Sulfate attack can be summarized by the four phenomena mentioned above. However their occurrence and their effects on the variation of the liquid phase depend on the zone of the sample and its position related to the surrounding aggressive solution [11]. For a better description of the liquid phase changes 3 zones of the tested samples are defined in Fig. 6. 
		 Zone I is in direct contact with the outer sulfate bearing solution. It is the most degraded part of the specimen. In this zone leaching and loss of aggregates are the main phenomena. In Zone II, leaching occurs but the pH is higher than in Zone I, thus the precipitation of expansive sulfate minerals takes place causing the cracking of the cement matrix under crystallization pressures. Cracks observed in Zone I and II take origin from Zone III where the three others phenomena do not exist. 
		 Based on the four main phenomena involved in the sulfate attack and the different zones previously defined, the expressions of mass (7), hydrostatic weighing (8), and volume variation (9) are written. 
		 [DELTA]M = [DELTA][M.sub.lea] + [DELTA][M.sub.ag.td] + [DELTA][M.sub.pre] + [DELTA][M.sub.cr] (7) 
		 with lea leaching, prec precipitation, ag.td. aggregates taking-down and cr cracking. 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.lea] = [DELTA][V.sub.lea.I] X [[rho].sub.lea] + [DELTA][V.sub.lea.II] ([[rho].sub.lea] - [[rho].sub.water]) (7.1) 
		 Leached minerals in ZONE II are replaced by water which reduces the mass of the solid phase and increases the mass of water. However in ZONE I the sample is at SSD state when the mass is measured. The volume of water corresponding to leaching is dried thus not considered in the mass balance. 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.ag.td] = [DELTA][V.sub.agtd.I] x [[rho].sub.ag] (7.2) 
		 The aggregate taking-down occurs especially in ZONE I. The water replacing aggregates is dried when measuring SSD mass, this is why the mass variation is limited to the mass of taken-down aggregates. 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.prec] = [DELTA][V.sub.prec.II]([[rho].sub.prec] - [[rho].sub.water]) (7.3) 
		 Precipitated minerals increase the mass of the solid phase and reduce the volume of free water in the pores. 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.cr] = [DELTA] [V.sub.cr] x [[rho].sub.water] (7.4) 
		 Water fills the cracks generated during sulfate attack and increases the SSD mass of the sample. 
		 In the same way the hydrostatic weighing balance is established. It is influenced only by solid phase variations, thus it is possible to decouple the variations of the solid and liquid phases by combining the mass and the hydrostatic weighing expressions. 
		 [DELTA][P.sub.hyd] = [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.lea] + [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.ag.td.] + [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.pre] (8) 
		 with [P.sub.hyd] the hydrostatic weighing, lea leaching, prec precipitation and ag.td. aggregates taking-down 
		 [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.lea] = [DELTA][V.sub.lea]([[rho].sub.lea] - [[rho].sub.water]) = [DELTA][V.sub.lea.1] ([[rho].sub.lea] - [[rho].sub.water]) + [DELTA][V.sub.lea.2] ([[rho].sub.lea] - [[rho].sub.water]) (8.1) 
		 Due to the minerals leached in ZONES 1 and 11 the hydrostatic weighing decreases 
		 [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.ag.dt] = [DELTA][V.sub.ad.dt.1] ([[rho].sub.ag] - [[rho].sub.water]) (8.2) 
		 The aggregates taken-down in ZONE I results in a decrease of the hydrostatic weighing. 
		 [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.pre] = [DELTA][V.sub.prec.2] ([[rho].sub.prec] - [[rho].sub.water]) (8.3) 
		 The precipitation of minerals results in an increase in the mass of the solid phase and the resulting hydrostatic weighing 
		 [DELTA]V = [DELTA]M - [DELTA][P.sub.hyd]/[[rho].sub.water] - [DELTA][V.sub.cr] + [DELTA][V.sub.lea.1] + [DELTA][V.sub.ag.td.I] (9) 
		 The volume variation calculation (9) obtained by combining the weight and hydrostatic weighing highlights the volume variations undergone by the solid part of the zone I (due to leaching and aggregates taking-down) and the variations of the free water volume in the Zones I, II, III due to the infiltration of water in the cracks. However the above expression is not sensitive to the local volumes changes taking place in Zone II more precisely variations due to leaching and precipitation of minerals. The cracks and the pores are actually filled or widen by minerals precipitation or leaching without a change in the overall volume. In order to take into account previously missed variations, the calculation of the change of effective free water volume [DELTA][V.sub.FW] can be written as: 
		 [DELTA][V.sub.FW] = [DELTA]V - [DELTA][V.sub.lea.II] -- [DELTA][V.sub.prec.II] (10) 
		 The free water volume variation (10) is in direct relation with the variation of the porosity of the cementitious matrix during the sulfate attack, which is likely to influence the transport properties during sulfate attack. 
		 The quantification of the volumes of minerals leached and precipitated in Zone II, and their influence on the volume of free water is not possible with the developed monitoring strategy. Thus these changes (Zone II) are combined with the variations due to cracking determined experimentally (11). In this way the new integrated ratio [f.sub.lea.prec] expresses the rate of cracks closing or widening due to mineral modifications. For positive volume variations, when [f.sub.lea.prec]  1 we can say that the precipitation takes over leaching phenomena to reduce the amount of free water in Zone II, however for [f.sub.lea.prec]  1 cracks widening takes place and leaching takes over precipitation. 
		 [DELTA] [M.sub.water.poro] [f.sub.lea.prec] X [DELTA]V X [[rho].sub.w] (11) 
		 3.3.3. Variations of solid phase 
		 In the solid part, leaching and precipitation of minerals and aggregates taking-down occur in the previously defined zones (12). 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.sol] = [DELTA][M.sub.sol.leal.and.II] + [DELTA][M.sub.sol.ag.td.I] + [DELTA][M.sub.sol.prec.II] (12) 
		 OH ions are released during the leaching of hydration products. The mass variation caused by leaching corresponds to the number of leached [OH.sup.-] [N.sub.lea] multiplied by the unknown molar mass [Mo.sub.lea]. The main minerals likely to leach release a number of OH" ions n per leached mole (Table 3). The apparent molar mass corresponding to the leached minerals will be [Mo.sub.ap] = [Mo.sub.lea]/n where the actual molar mass [Mo.sub.ila] can be estimated according to (Table 3). 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.lea] = -[N.sub.lea.1] x [M.sub.olea]/n - [N.sub.lea.2] x [Mo.sub.lea]/n (12.1) 
		 Considering the aggregates taking-down directly related to the amount of leached minerals and in absence of experimental data quantifying the taken down aggregates, the unknown ratio [f.sub.ag.td] is defined from the calculated leaching mass variation in order to estimate the aggregates taken-down mass variation. 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.ag.dt] = -[f.sub.ag.td.] X [N.sub.lea] x [M.sub.olea]/n (12.2) 
		 In the same way the precipitation mass variation is estimated from experimental data and unknown physical factors measured experimentally. So the hydrostatic variations corresponding to the leaching and taken-down aggregates are calculated to get the precipitation hydrostatic weighing variation [DELTA][P.sub.hydr] = [DELTA][P.sub.hydr,prec+] [DELTA][P.sub.hydr,lea] + [DELTA][P.sub.hydr,ag.td]. Two others unknown factors, the densities of leached and precipitated minerals [[rho].sub.lea] and [[rho].sub.prec], are introduced to get mass variations from hydrostatic weighing. 
		 [DELTA][M.sub.prec] = [DELTA][P.sub.hydr.prec]/([[rho].sub.prec] - [[rho].sub.water]) x [[rho].sub.prec] (12.3) 
		 With [DELTA][P.sub.hydr.prec] = [DELTA][P.sub.hydr] + [N.sub.lea] x [Mo.sub.lea]/[[rho].sub.lea] ([[rho].sub.lea] - [[rho].sub.eau]) +[f.sub.gra.dec] x [N.sub.lea] x [Mo.sub.lea]/[[rho].sub.gra] x ([[rho].sub.gra] - [[rho].sub.eau]) 
		 Combining the different mass variations corresponding to highlighted phenomena the mass variation expression (13) is obtained. 
		 [DELTA]M = -[N.sub.lea] x [Mo.sub.ap] - [f.sub.TD].[N.sub.lea].[Mo.sub.ap] + [DELTA][P.sub.hydr.prec]/([[rho].sub.prec] - [[rho].sub.water] x [[rho].sub.prec] + [f.sub.lea.prec] x [DELTA]V (13) 
		 3.3.4. Definition of the types of precipitation 
		 During sulfate attack, as the sulfate ions reach the reactive phases, precipitation products appear. Sulfate bearing minerals precipitate in the pores and the leached zones of the chemically affected region of the sample. They exert a crystallization pressure on the walls of the filled zones, generating the gradual expansion of the specimen. Three types of precipitated volumes can be distinguished: the global precipitation [DELTA][V.sub.glo.prec], the filling precipitation [DELTA][V.sub..fil.prec] , and the cracks precipitation [DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec] (Fig. 7). 
		 The globally measured volume of the sample is the volume obtained after the aggregates loss (volume loss) and the precipitation of expansive minerals (volume gain) during the sulfate attack (Fig. 8). From the different volume variations corresponding to different phenomena (Fig. 12), the absolute expansion of the specimen can be deduced according to the following equation: 
		 [DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec] = [DELTA][V.sub.global] + [absolute value of [DELTA][V.sub.agr.loss]] (14) 
		 With [DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec] the volume variation due only to the precipitation (including cracks), [DELTA][V.sub.global], the global resulting volume variation (including all phenomena) and [DELTA][V.sub.agr.loss] the volume variation due to the aggregates loss mainly occurred at the surface of the sample. 
		 Deducing the absolute swelling volume variation [DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec] from the global precipitated volume variation [DELTA] [V.sub.glo.prec] presented at Fig. 12, we get the filling precipitation volume variation [DELTA][V.sub.fil.prec] (15) or the precipitation volume filling vacant spaces (pores or leached zones), triggering the expansion. In Eq. (15) we consider that micro-cracks generated especially at the first stages of the external sulfate attack and causing the samples swelling ([DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec]) are fully filled by expansive sulfate minerals. At the advanced stages of degradation, in presence of macro-cracks, the assumption of filled cracks becomes less relevant and the accuracy of the calculated [DELTA][V.sub.fil.prec] is reduced. 
		 [DELTA][V.sub.fil.prec] = [DELTA][V.sub.glo.prec] - [DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec] (15) 
		 3.4. Parameters calculation 
		 The monitoring strategy is based on the four main chemical and mechanical changes encountered during sulfate attack. To determine the values of the physical parameters integrated in the model: [Mo.sub.lea], [[rho].sub.lea]. [[rho].sub.prec]. [f.sub.lea.prec] and [f.sub.tag.td], we proceeded by calibrating the calculated mass variation on the experimental mass variation curve. 
		 By minimizing the sum of squared differences (16) between the theoretical points and the experimental mass variations, the physical parameters corresponding to the best fitting curve could be assessed. 
		 R = [SIGMA][(x-y).sup.2] (16) 
		 x is the measured mass variation and y is the calculated mass variation. 
		 3.5. New performance indicators 
		 3.5.1. Averaged density indicator 
		 In order to gather the information collected at the macroscopic and microscopic levels in a single indicator deduced from the monitoring of performance tests, the "averaged density" indicator was defined. The sum of the absolute mass variations generated by the four phenomena of sulfate attack was divided by the sum of corresponding absolute volume variations. In this way, the obtained values at different times of sulfate attack test highlight the prevailing material and the corresponding phenomena causing the variations of mass and volume of cementitious materials (Fig. 15). This allows describing the scenario of sulfate attack using a single indicator (17). 
		 AD = [[SIGMA].sup.4.sub.i=1][absolute value of [DELTA][m.sub.i]]/ [[SIGMA].sup.4.sub.i=1][absolute value of [DELTA][v.sub.i]] (17) 
		 with AD the averaged density indicator, [absolute value of [DELTA][m.sub.i]] and [absolute value of [DELTA][v.sub.i]] the elemental absolute mass and volume variations corresponding to the four sulfate attack phenomena. 
		 3.5.2. Deformation path indicator 
		 The absolute radius variation, i.e. the lateral deformation, can be deduced from the absolute volume ([DELTA][V.sub.cr.prec] in Eq. (15)). The length variations of the cylindrical samples were directly assessed from experimental data. The deformation path corresponds to the lateral vs. longitudinal deformation graph. It makes it possible to classify cement-based materials as a function of the magnitude of the deformations. This approach is useful when testing low-expansion materials, because lateral deformation was found more sensitive to sulfate attack than longitudinal expansion. 
		 3.5.3. Expansion potential indicator 
		 In order to estimate the expansion potential of cement-based materials in sulfate-rich environments, we introduce in this section a procedure to calculate the expansive pressure, combining the developed tensile stresses in the samples during the sulfate attack with the volume of sulfate bearing precipitated minerals. 
		 The "hinge point" defined on the graphs of expansion variation (Fig. 17) corresponds to the tensile stress capacity of samples, reached at the values varying between 0.01 and 0.02 % [6,20], Based on compressive strength of the mortars, determined on mortar cubes, we deduced the tensile stress strength [f.sub.t] of mortar tested samples according to the Eurocode 2 expressions : [[sigma].sub.ten].NSR = 3.75, [[sigma].sub.ten.SR5] = 3.85 and [[sigma].sub.ten.SR3] = 3.8 MPa. 
		 The volume of expansive minerals is first represented as an equivalent volume cube (Fig. 9). In order to assess an equivalent expansive pressure, the cube is assumed to be confined like the sulfate minerals formed in the pores causing expansion. Consequently the volume increase of the precipitated minerals results in stresses in the sample until reaching the tensile strength, corresponding to hinge point on the longitudinal expansion graphs (Fig. 17). In order to calculate the equivalent expansive pressure (18), the sides of the equivalent confined cube [S.sub.hinge] are assumed to be submitted to the resulting tensile load [F.sub.ten.hinge] developed by the core of the sample at [t.sub.hinge] (Fig. 9). 
		 EPI = [F.sub.ten.hinge]/[S.sub.hinge] (18) 
		 At [t.sub.hinge] the degraded depth is calculated to get the resisting section of the sample which holds the tensile force generated in the samples core due to the precipitation in outer expansive zones. Based on the calculated leached volume variation (Fig. 12), we reach back to the corresponding Portlandite-free degraded depth (Portlandite is the main leached mineral). Then the resisting section can be deduced and the tensile load corresponding to the tensile strength can be determined for each tested material. 
		 4. Results and discussions 
		 After describing the approach used to identify leached, precipitated minerals, and other parameters representative of the mechanisms of sulfate attack, the results are analysed and discussed to provide more information on the microscopic evolution during sulfate attack as well as performance indicators. 
		 4.1. Macroscopic evolutions 
		 The first output of the monitoring strategy is the sample volume and the lateral cross section variations (radius). The most widely monitored geometrical parameter is the longitudinal expansion. However, in the case of non-swelling material exposed to sulfate, it does not change significantly. Thus expansion cannot capture some changes induced by the degradation, whereas the volume and radius sample monitoring allows assessing leaching activity and giving the corresponding geometrical variations. 
		 In the Fig. 10, the NSR cement containing the highest [C.sub.3]A percentage presents the highest length expansion rate. The SR5 and SR3 cements showed lower expansion rates since they contain less [C.sub.3]A, thus less expansive products can be formed. Moving to the radius and volume variations, we can distinguish two different behaviours. The first one corresponds to NSR mortar. Even if leaching and aggregates loss take place at the sample surfaces and theoretically leads to the radius reduction, the radius actually kept increasing due to radial expansion and lead to a positive global volume variation. The second behaviour corresponds to SR5 and SR3 mortars. The material lost at the surface could not be compensated by the expansion of the mortars, which was lower than NSR expansion. The radius showed a negative variation at the beginning of the tests for SR5 then it started to increase, which means that first leaching then expansion prevailed. SR3 mortars showed the lowest expansion rate and a continuous decrease of radius. The global volume variations of the three materials followed the radius variations, which suggest that lateral variations of dimensions had stronger effects than the longitudinal variations. 
		 4.2. Microscopic evolutions 
		 4.2.1. Discussion on the optimization of parameters 
		 In the previous sections the mass balance was established by distinguishing the mass variations due to each phenomenon. The optimisation (Fig. 11) procedure, detailed in the appendix, provides the values of parameters needed to determine the contributions of each phenomenon to the mass and volume variations of the samples (Table 5). Scrolling down the three sets of optimisation cartographies from the NSR to the SR3 cement containing respectively the highest and the lowest calcium aluminates percentages, the localisation of red zone varies (Fig. A.1), which reveals variations in the products affected by sulfate attack. At relatively low pH, portlandite is the main leached hydration product. Due to the chemical equilibrium between the cementitious matrix and the interstitial water, its dissolution actually maintains the basicity and the cement paste. Considering that portlandite is the major leached mineral would lead to the same molar mass as a solution (red zones positions) for the three different mortars. However the NSR mortar had higher [Mo.sub.lea]/n value than the other mortars (see first column of the Fig. A.1). The dissolution of portlandite releases two [OH.sup.-] ions, thus the corresponding value of [Mo.sub.lea]/n would be 37 g/mol. The SR5 and SR3 mortars showed lower values, which suggests that other hydration products have been leached (Table 5). The three cements had approximately the same density of the leached mineral (~2.3 g/ml), which corresponds to the CSH - Portlandite interval (Table 5). 
		 In the third column of Fig. A.l the NSR and SR5 mortars shows slightly lower values than the SR3 mortar. The first two cements compositions actually promoted the ettringite formation in the paste matrix during sulfate attack. Other sulfate-bearing phases were formed, such as gypsum. The resulting density is around 2.0 g/ml (Table 5), which is intermediate value between ettringite density (1.76 g/ml) and gypsum: density (2.30 g/ml). The SR3 mortar showed higher density (2.1 g/ml) of precipitated phase. As a consequence the gypsum/ettringite ratio of precipitated products increased with a decrease in [C.sub.3]A content. The formation of gypsum can be explained by the influence of pH profile within the specimen. In the zones where Portlandite is not completely leached, the pH is high enough to ensure the stability of ettringite. In the zones closer to the surface, where portlandite has been completely leached, the pH is lower and it tends to the pH of the external sulfate solution (7.5), thus only gypsum is stable. 
		 In the fourth column, the large red zones indicate a much less clear evolution of the optimal value of the aggregate loss parameter. With the four optimal known parameters, the chosen combinations contain different values for [f.sub.ag.td]. Looking for the optimal solution, the chosen combinations of parameters include the most convenient [f.sub.ag.td] value giving the lowest offset between the experimental and theoretical mass variation curves. 
		 In the fifth column, the optimal solution zones should be related to the global volume variation [DELTA]V for a better understanding of the physical evolution in the samples. According to the Eq. (11) if the global volume increases (positive [DELTA]V at Fig. 10), there is an additional quantity of free water entering into the sample to replace the leached minerals or to fill the formed cracks, which is the case of NSR mortar. However if the global volume decreases (negative [DELTA]V at Fig. 10), the sample loses a part of its initial free water either by the degradation of the surface or by precipitation of minerals in the pores leading to remove water outside the sample which is the case for SR5 and SR3. 
		 The leached and precipitated minerals and other relevant parameters could be determined. The obtained values can now be used to describe the mechanisms of sulfate attack, to define new types of monitoring, giving more information on the microscopic evolutions during sulfate attack. 
		 4.2.2. Microscopic volume variation 
		 Volume variations corresponding to the four main phenomena involved in sulfate attack can be deduced from mass variations (Fig. 12). This monitoring strategy analyses the sulfate attack mechanism from another angle than usual monitoring parameters, such as expansion and strength. 
		 The first graph in the Fig. 12 represents the volume variation corresponding to leaching. It shows a common behaviour of the three series of specimens. The Table 6 giving the portlandite volume fractions in the three different mortars seems in good agreement with the graph of Fig. 12. The SR5 mortar containing the highest fraction of portlandite showed higher volume lost by leaching. 
		 The aggregates loss and precipitation graphs show significant differences, highlighting different behaviours due to different cement compositions, for instance at the level of calcium aluminates phases. The NSR containing the highest [C.sub.3]A fraction showed the highest precipitation volume due to its higher potential to form more ettringite than other cements, in addition to other sulfate-bearing minerals such as gypsum. Higher the precipitation volume is, higher the cracking probability is. This could explain the relatively high volumes of lost aggregates and mortar for the NSR mortar. The SR5 and SR3 mortars, following the same trend of aggregates loss variations, presented less precipitation volume variation, revealing better durability when exposed to sulfate. 
		 The second graph of the Fig. 12 shows two different evolutions of free water variation. Taking into account the relatively high rates of precipitation and cracking, the NSR mortars showed a positive volume variation due to water uptake in the formed cracks. However, for the sulfate resisting cements SR3 and SR5 the mortars presented a negative variation due to the loss of pores free water at the degraded surface (where the aggregates loss is significant), and the relatively low crystallization pressure of sulfate precipitated minerals causing less cracks and less water uptake than the NSR mortar. 
		 4.2.3. Filling precipitation and leached volumes equivalence 
		 It is known that during sulfate attack some minerals are leached and others precipitate but the relation between leaching and precipitation is still ambiguous. The Fig. 13 shows a relatively strong correlation between the relative filling precipitation volume ([DELTA][V.sub.fil.prec]/[V.sub.0]) and the relative leached volume. Considering that portlandite is the main leached phase, the corresponding zones are favouring the formation of expansive minerals in collaboration with the reactant zones nearby. Once the portlandite is leached, the reactive zone is actually rich in calcium (coming from portlandite) and sulfate (coming from the external aggressive solution), which triggers chemical reactions to restore the thermodynamic equilibrium. In this sulfate-saturated environment, the existing AFm minerals are destabilised to form the ettringite and the overflow of sulfate forms gypsum in presence of calcium provided by leaching. In the chemically affected zone, the precipitated sulfate minerals proportions and the crystallization pressure vary according to the cement composition and the proportions of hydration products. 
		 4.2.4. Longitudinal and lateral deformations as a function of filling precipitation 
		 Crystallization pressure due to the sulfate minerals precipitations induce longitudinal and lateral deformations of the cylindrical mortar samples. In this section, for a better understanding of precipitation/swelling mechanism, leaching and aggregates loss are pushed aside in order to focus on the lateral and longitudinal deformations due to precipitation and cracking. 
		 The Fig. 14 shows a set of linear correlations between filling precipitation and length changes of the mortar samples. At the beginning of tests, the first linear trend line represents the first stage of degradation. The longitudinal deformation increases as crystallization pressure develops and tensile loads are generated. Then the slope of the curves significantly increases as the deformation has exceeded the tensile strain capacity of the material and micro-cracks cause damage. 
		 The second row of the Fig. 14 shows a different aspect of the mechanism. The stairs-like shape highlights the layer by layer degradation at the surface of tested samples. 
		 The SR5 mortar showed slightly different filling precipitation/ deformation behaviour characterized by a longer initial stage. It could be explained by the effect of portlandite on the expansion evolution, mentioned in Section 3.5.3. The SR5 actually has the highest portlandite content (Table 6). The precipitated minerals could fill larger spaces in capillary pores, in the leached portlandite region. This could have delayed the supersaturation in the micropores thus the effect of crystallization pressure. 
		 4.3. Performance indicators 
		 4.3.1. Averaged density 
		 Three different shapes of averaged density curves can be seen on Fig. 15. They actually reveal different behaviours during sulfate attack. All the average density curves start form 2.2 to 2.25 g/ml. Portlandite (2.24 g/ml density) actually was the most reactive mineral at the beginning of sulfate attack. Then the precipitation took place, filling the pores and causing cracking in the mortar matrix with different rates, depending on the mineralogical cement paste composition and its ability to generate crystallization pressure inside the mortars. The decreasing averaged density of the NSR mortar curve is due to the formation of less dense minerals, which is consistent with ettringite formation (1.76 g/ml density) and cracking then water uptake (1 g/ml density). Thus a significant decrease of averaged density indicates a poor durability of the cementitious material. For instance, the slopes of SR5 and SR3 (sulfate resisting cements) curves are moderate, in comparison with the NSR mortar. For the SR3 mortar, a slight ascending slope can be observed instead of descending slope, showing the lowest rate of cracking among the 3 tested mortars. This could correspond to the precipitation of other sulfate minerals like gypsum, moving the averaged density toward its 2.3 g/ml density. 
		 4.3.2. Deformation path 
		 The NSR mortar presented the highest pressure revealed by the longitudinal expansion seen on the Fig. 16, whereas the SR3 relatively poor in expansive minerals remained at the beginning of the deformation path with relatively low longitudinal deformations. 
		 The sulfate-bearing phases produced during sulfate attack depend on the cement composition and the hydration products in the mortar pastes. Some cement pastes, such as NSR paste, are more able to produce ettringite then gypsum, whereas other cements, such as SR5 and SR3, are likely to form more gypsum than ettringite. Different crystallization pressures are induced but the expansion mechanism for the different mortars, according to the Fig. 16, was approximately the same. Considering the mortar samples have approximately the same mechanical properties, the samples follow the same path of deformation. At the beginning of the sulfate attack, lateral deformations mainly take place, and then the precipitated minerals induce higher and higher tensile stress level inside the sample, pushing forward the longitudinal expansion. 
		 4.3.3. Expansion potential 
		 The Table 7 presents three sets of EPI (expansion potential indicators) values. These values cannot be considered as crystallization pressures exerted on the pore walls at the microscopic level, but they provide an indicator related to the maximum pressure that can be generated in a given cement-based material. In the first column we considered that the filling precipitation volume is the only source of crystallization pressure inside the samples so the equivalent cube volume takes into account only the filling precipitation volume ([[DELTA].sub.fil.prec]) at [t.sub.hinge] (Fig. 17). In the second column, we considered that the formed sulfate minerals volumes exceeding the vacant available space (portlandite-free zones and pores), and precipitating in the generated cracks, participate to the development of the tensile stress in the core of the samples. According to this assumption, the equivalent cube volume correspond to the overall precipitated volume ([[DELTA].sub.glo.prec]) at [t.sub.hinge], which leads to larger cubes and surfaces S, so lower calculated crystallization pressure than the first column. The obtained values agree with the 8 MPa value given in a previous work aimed at identifying the macroscopic crystallization pressure on hollow tubes exposed to external sulfate attack [27], In the third column, we considered that the equivalent depth of portlandite-free zones contains the expansible minerals and all the leached region exerts the tensile stress on the core of the cylindrical specimen. Then the EPI can be deduced from the tensile force limit [F.sub.ten.hinge] and the equivalent degraded section. 
		 The sulfate attack of the Portland cement based mortars lead to the precipitation of sulfate minerals like gypsum and ettringite but in different proportions. The resulting crystallization pressure depends on the proportions of the minerals and the confinement conditions or the pores where the minerals precipitate. Different minerals mixes precipitated in the different tested mortars. In the three sets of the Table 7 the NSR mortar presents the highest EPI which highlights the ettringite formation. The SR5 and SR3 mortars showed lower EPI, thus lower potential for sulfate attack induced cracking of the cement paste, which is in good agreement with the sulfate resisting property of the durable cements. 
		 5. Conclusions 
		 Based on monitoring of sulfate attack tests at the macroscopic and intermediate levels a new strategy was developed to provide the estimation of microscopic evolutions, more precisely, the volume variations entrained by each of the phenomena involved in the sulfate attack: leaching, precipitation, free water variation and aggregates loss. It does not require microstructural analysis to be used in performance tests and criteria. This strategy gives quantitative information about changes at the microscopic scale thus a description of the sulfate attack scenario from relatively simple monitored parameters, which makes it original. 
		 * The optimisation maps show the accuracy of the monitoring strategy to characterize the tested mortars and their different behaviours during sulfate attack. The best fit physical and chemical parameters values agree with the existing knowledge collected from other works on the sulfate attack mechanism, which confirms the relevance of the physical concepts adopted in the strategy principle and the reliability of results. 
		 * The observed equivalence between the leached minerals volume and the filling precipitation volume highlights the reactivity of portlandite and its ability to trigger the formation of expansive products. A potential correlation between the portlandite quantities, the morphologies of corresponding zones, and the expansion mechanism including expansive mineral quantities and reaction kinetics could exist and still to be established. 
		 * The longitudinal expansion curves show different stages of deformation when correlated with a filling precipitation factor. First a linear variation can be observed as a function of mineral precipitation and then the deformation slope increases with the filling precipitation volume or the time revealing the macrocracks generation. The lateral expansion shows a stair shape as a function of precipitated minerals, highlighting the layer by layer degradation of the surface exposed to sulfate attack in contrast with longitudinal deformation and cracking. 
		 * Taking into account all the phenomena involved in sulfate attack and their effect on the durability of tested materials, the "averaged density" was defined as a performance criteria. This indicator proved its capability to describe the performance of tested materials, pointing out the type of precipitated minerals, the rate of leaching and cracking during the sulfate attack. The averaged density indicator was found sensitive to the different used cements and behaviours, which makes this indicator a potential performance indicator. 
		 * Another deformation based performance indicator 'deformation path' was introduced. The longitudinal and lateral variations combined show up a common length/radius deformation path for the different mortars. The maximum levels reached on the deformation path varied, showing up the different levels of cements durability. 
		 * The final performance proposed indicator was 'expansion potential indicator'. Different tested cement compositions lead to different mixes of precipitated sulfate minerals generating different crystallization pressures inside the tested mortars. This introduced indicator gave an estimation of the expansive pressure and a durability performance based classification for the tested cements. 
		 The developed strategy and the physical parameters determined in this work can be applied to any cement-based material whatever the nature of the leached or precipitated minerals since no assumption on these minerals is required in the model. Microscopic monitoring provided by the strategy makes it applicable in other attacks such as chloride ingress, monitoring of cracking under continuous or momentary stress, self-healing. 
		 Appendix 
		 Optimization cartography discussion 
		 Knowing the main hydration products and the corresponding chemical equilibriums helps defining the variation domains of physical parameters. Table 3 gives the chemical reactions, the densities and the molar masses of the main hydration products found in an OPC paste. Based on these chemical data the variation ranges of the parameters were defined as mentioned in Table 4 in order to limit the optimization task to a plausible variation domain. 
		 In order to understand the relation between the physical parameters and their influence on the coefficient R a 6D solution domain was defined including the variation domain of the 5 physical parameters and the coefficient R. Then the 6D domain points were projected on 5x2D plans (R function of one of the physical parameters) on Fig. A.1. 
		 The domain of precipitated and leached minerals densities was defined between 1.1 and 2.3 g/ml to include all hydration products susceptible to react during the sulfate attack. In the same way the limits of the apparent molar mass [Mo.sub.app] = [Mo.sub.lea]/n domain were determined considering that one dissolved mineral molecule gives only one [OH.sup.-] ion. The upper and lower limits of [Mo.sub.app] definition domain were determined by dividing the molar masses by the number of [OH.sup.-]/ [H.sup.+] (based on the Table 3 chemical reactions). 20 and 100 g/mol were chosen as limits including all the probably leached minerals, mainly portlandite and CSH. In absence of experimental data related to taken-down aggregates the fagtci variation domain was chosen as large as possible to cover the possible optimal solution intervals. The/ieaprec parameter describes the free water variations during sulfate attack; it varies between 0 and 3 to include the two possible cracks state variations: widening ([f.sub.lea.prec]  1) or filling ([f.sub.lea.prec  1) of cracks by minerals leaching and precipitation. 
		 Once the variation domains of physical parameters were defined, these domains were divided into intervals to get intermediate values between the upper and lower limits of each physical parameter. Then the least square (14) corresponding to all the possible combinations between the 5 parameters were calculated. In the Fig. A.1 each graph presents, via the coloured cartography, the densities repartition of the calculated R values corresponding to all the predefined combinations, as a function of one physical parameter. 
		 Red zones indicate the zones of solution values. Relatively restrained red zones in the first, second, third and fifth columns show the strong effect of some parameters of the predefined domain on the minimization of the least squares. On the fourth graph the large red zone shows a less decisive role attributed to this parameter in curve fitting which implies relatively lower relevance of the values obtained via curve fitting procedure. 
		 HIGHLIGHTS 
		 * Development of a monitoring strategy. 
		 * Decoupling of the sulfate attack phenomena.

<titre>"Tired of fog? Try the frogs!" Paris tries to poach London business after Brexit</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		By Guy Faulconbridge 
		 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - With a quip about British fog and French frogs, Paris began an advertising campaign on Monday aimed at poaching business from London after the Brexit vote raised questions about the future dominance of Europe's top financial capital. 
		 Billboards showing a green frog wearing a tie sporting the colours of the French flag and the slogan "Tired of the fog? Try the Frogs! Choose <mention id="1924">Paris La Defense</mention>" are being put up at London's Heathrow Airport and the London train station of the Eurostar, showcasing <mention id="1925">the French capital's business district</mention>.
		The June 23 vote to leave the EU took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. 
		 Some bankers have warned that London could gradually lose its position as the only financial capital to rival New York because foreign banks could move out after Brexit, draining London of talent, wealth and trading revenues. 
		 London accounts for 41 percent of global foreign exchange turnover, more than double the nearest competitor, New York, according to the Bank for International Settlements. London's closest European competitors are Switzerland and Paris, which each take about 3 percent of global foreign exchange turnover. 
		 Around 85 percent of European-based hedge funds are based in London, which is also the leading market for international insurance and reinsurance. 
		 Officials from <mention id="1926">La Defense business district</mention> said the adverts were aimed at underscoring the attractiveness of <mention id="1927">the French capital's financial powerhouse</mention>, which it said had lower rentals and good public transport. 
		 "As regrettable as Britain's exit from the European Union may be, we have to be pragmatic and promote our own assets," Patrick Devedjian, head of the elected council representing <mention id="1928">the Hauts-de-Seine district</mention> where <mention id="1929">La Defense</mention> is located, said in a statement. 
		 Marie-Cecile Guillaume, director general of Defacto, a public body involved in managing <mention id="1930">La Defense</mention>, said the campaign aimed to roll out "the blue, white and red carpet for thousands of professionals now seeking new European headquarters." 
		 This summer the French government introduced extra tax concessions for expatriates in the hope Paris could profit from Brexit, but experts say other centres with more flexible labour and tax rules are likely to be bigger beneficiaries. 
		 French President Francois Hollande said on Saturday that Britain's decision to leave the European Union should not jeopardize the bloc's principle of free movement. 
		 "They have decided to leave. I think the worst attitude would be to contest their choice or call into question the very foundations of the European Union," Hollande told a conference on Europe in Paris.

<titre>UN adviser on preventing genocide deplores 'inflammatory statements' by senior Burundi official.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Aug 26, 2016 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The United Nations Special Adviser on Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, has expressed concern at inflammatory statements concerning the genocide in Rwanda that were made by a senior official of the ruling party in Burundi and cautioned that such statements could constitute incitement to violence. 
		 On 16 August, Pascal Nyabenda, at that time the President of the ruling Conseil national pour la defense de la democratie-Forces pour la defense de la democratie (CNDD-FDD) party and President of the National Assembly suggested that the genocide in Rwanda was a "fabrication of the international community" and that it was used to remove the Hutu government that was in place at the time.
		"This irresponsible statement could be interpreted as genocide denial", Mr. Dieng said in a statement issued by his Office yesterday. 
		 "[It] has the potential to inflame ethnic tensions, both within Burundi and outside its borders," he warned. 
		 A new head of the CNDD-FDD has been appointed by the party at its meeting on 20 August but Mr. Nyabenda continues in his role as President of the National Assembly. 
		 The statement added that the situation in the African country continues to be marred by instability and serious human rights violations, including allegations of extra-judicial killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention of members of the opposition, civil society and those suspected of opposing the Government continue to be reported. 
		 Concerns at the situation in Burundi were also expressed by the Geneva-based UN Committee Against Torture in their concluding observations, issued on 11 August, following its review of a special report submitted at the request of the Committee. 
		 Mr. Dieng's statement noted that the Committee had urged the Government of Burundi to refrain from making any public statements that could exacerbate ethnic tensions or incite violence or hatred and to ensure that public and law enforcement officials do not accept or tolerate such acts. 
		 The Committee Against Torture is a body of independent human rights experts who monitor the implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment by its State parties. 
		 Mr. Dieng's statement also noted that human rights defenders and journalists are among the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled the country since April 2015. 
		 He further raised concern that the youth wing of the CNDD-FDD party, known as the Imbonerakure, continues to be associated with human rights abuses and is reported to have threatened ethnic violence. 
		 According to the country's Minister of the Interior, the Imbonakure formed part of the national security strategy, noted the statement. 
		 Reminding the Government of its obligation to protect its populations, regardless of their ethnicity or political affiliation, and to refrain from any action or discourse that could inflame ethnic tensions, Mr. Dieng stressed: 
		 "[It is important to] counter such messages with alternative speech to foster unity rather than further entrench divisions, and [I call] call on all parties to prioritize inclusive dialogue to bring about an end to the protracted crisis." 
		 Burundi was thrown into crisis more than a year ago when President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to run for a controversial third term that he went on to win. To date, it has been reported that hundreds of people have been killed, more than 240,000 have fled the nation, and thousands more have been arrested and possibly subjected to human rights violations.

<titre>Country Report Burundi 1st Quarter 2015 Outlook for 2015-16: Democracy index: Burundi</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Burundi's rank has continued to drop in The Economist Intelligence Unit's democracy index for 2014, to 134th out of 167 countries, from 129th a year earlier and 106th as recently as 2008, reflecting further drift towards authoritarianism. For a third consecutive year Burundi has fallen within the category of "authoritarian" regimes, which includes 22 out of 44 Sub-Saharan African countries. Burundi now ranks below its neighbour, Rwanda (131st), and remains far behind the other members of the East African Community, Kenya (96th), Uganda (95th) and Tanzania (89th). 
		 2010 election heralded democratic regression 
		 A major turning point in Burundi's democratic regression was the election of 2010, the results of which were contested by the opposition, triggering a political stand-off. With a new round of elections coming up in 2015, the situation remains deadlocked, as the ruling Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratie-Forces pour la défense de la démocratie (CNDD-FDD) continues to close down the political space and restrict freedoms. Coupled with continued reports of politically motivated repression, insecurity and violence, this has resulted in a fall in Burundi's overall score to 3.33.
		The electoral process in Burundi is weak, as highlighted by the contentious 2010 polls. Although international observers were broadly satisfied with municipal elections in 2010, opposition parties alleged fraud and boycotted the remaining legislative and presidential polls-with the exception of the Union pour le progrès national (Uprona) and the Front pour la démocratie au Burundi (Frodebu)-Nyakuri. As a result, the presidential election in 2010 resembled a referendum for the president, which failed to generate a dynamic democratic exchange. The score in this category fell further this year, to 2.58, as new restrictions on the establishment of and meetings by political parties and civil society organisations were introduced. 
		 President and ruling party have poor accountability 
		 Burundi's performance in the functioning of government category remains at 2.21-the country's lowest score, reflecting the poor accountability of the president, Pierre Nkurunziza, and his CNDD-FDD party, who dominate all branches of power. The influence of the CNDD-FDD's youth wing, the Imbonerakure, and its role in "maintaining order and security", is a particular concern. Public confidence in the government is low. Moreover, investors and foreign agencies cannot rely on speed or predictability in their dealings with government agencies, and neither can the justice system be relied on to enforce contracts or property rights. 
		 The score for political participation remains unchanged, at 3.89; the constitution, approved in 2005, outlines a requirement for balance of power between Hutus and Tutsis at all levels of government. In practice, however, abiding by the constitutional requirements for gender and ethnic participation in the government appears to be a box-ticking exercise for the administration. This score could drop further in the next survey, especially if the ruling party succeeds in removing some of the ethnic power-sharing rules from the constitution. 
		 Download the numbers in Excel 
		 Crackdown on critics and opponents 
		 The authorities have used the threat of "armed bandits" to extend the security apparatus and to justify widespread arrests and harassment of journalists, opposition activists and union members, weighing heavily on the country's score for civil liberties. That remains at 2.94, in part reflecting the country's highly restrictive press law, which proscribes the coverage of some sensitive national issues and could require journalists to disclose their sources. Despite ongoing ethnic tensions, political culture is still Burundi's best-scoring category, propped up by the general support among its citizens for democracy. 
		 Download the numbers in Excel 
		 A free white paper containing the full index and detailed methodology can be downloaded from www.eiu.com/democracy2014. 
		 Note on methodology 
		 There is no consensus on how to measure democracy, and definitions of democracy are contested. Having free and fair competitive elections, and satisfying related aspects of political freedom, is the sine qua non of all definitions. However, our index is based on the view that measures of democracy that reflect the state of political freedom and civil liberties are not "thick" enough: they do not encompass sufficiently some crucial features that determine the quality and substance of democracy. Our index therefore also includes measures of political participation, political culture and functioning of government, which are, at best, marginalised by other measures. 
		 Our index of democracy covers 167 countries and territories. The index, on a 0-10 scale, is based on the ratings (0, 0.5 or 1) for 60 indicators grouped in five categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. Each category has a rating on a 0-10 scale, and the overall index of democracy is the simple average of the five category indices. 
		 The category indices are based on the sum of the indicator scores in the category, converted to a 0-10 scale. Adjustments to the category scores are made if countries do not score a 1 in the following critical areas for democracy: 
		 whether national elections are free and fair; 
		 the security of voters; 
		 the influence of foreign powers on government; and  
		 the capability of the civil service to implement policies. 
		 If the scores for the first three questions are 0 (or 0.5), one point (0.5 points) is deducted from the index in the relevant category (either electoral process and pluralism or functioning of government). If the score for 4 is 0, one point is deducted from the functioning of government category index. 
		 The index values are used to place countries within one of four types of regime: 
		 full democracies-scores of 8 to 10; 
		 flawed democracies-scores of 6 to 7.9; 
		 hybrid regimes-scores of 4 to 5.9; 
		 authoritarian regimes-scores below 4. 
		 Thresholds for regime types depend on overall scores that are rounded to one decimal point. 
		 Democracy index
		   Regime type  Overall score  Overall rank
		2014  Authoritarian  3.33 out of 10  134 out of 167
		2013  Authoritarian  3.41 out of 10  =129 out of 167
		2012  Authoritarian  3.60 out of 10  125 out of 167
		  
		 Democracy index 2014 by category
		(On a scale of 0 to 10)
		Electoral process  Functioning of government  Political participation  Political culture  Civil liberties
		2.58  2.21  3.89  5.00  2.94

		Dec 1 (Reuters) - France and Belgium are hunting suspects and would-be attackers following the shootings and bombings in Paris on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and injured hundreds. 
		 Eight attackers are dead and the total number of assailants may have been 10 or higher. Investigations are centred on Salah Abdeslam. Police think he may be an assailant referred to in an Islamic State statement claiming responsibility for the attacks.
		Here is what we know about the suspects and the wider circle pursued by police. 
		 KEY EVENTS: Nov 13: France. Seven assailants dead: three at the Bataclan concert hall, three outside the Stade de France stadium and one of three gunmen involved in the cafe shootings. Nov 18: France. Three people died and eight were arrested in a police assault on a hideout flat in St. Denis, north of Paris. One of the three was suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who played a direct role in the cafe shootings, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. Nov 21: Belgium reports a serious and imminent danger of Paris-style attacks, deploying soldiers on the streets of Brussels and conducting police searches for would-be attackers and suspects with links to the Paris attacks. Nov 26: Belgium eases the maximum alert level in Brussels. 
		 UNACCOUNTED FOR: 
		 Salah Abdeslam, 26, French, born in Brussels (Sept. 15, 1989). Suspected of having rented the VW Polo and Renault Clio cars used in the attacks. Investigators say he went to Belgium from France the day after the attacks in a VW Golf, despite being stopped by French police along the way in routine road checks before his name was circulated as a suspect. 
		 His brother Brahim died in the attack (below). A third brother, cleared of any involvement after briefly being detained, said Salah may have had a change of heart in Paris. 
		 However, fears that Salah was back in Belgium and/or plotting attacks prompted the closure of Brussels underground rail lines, schools, shopping centres and other public places on Nov. 20. The shutdown was partially lifted on Nov. 25. 
		 French police are examining a suicide belt dumped in Montrouge on the southwestern fringes of Paris, where phone traces suggested Salah was present on the night of Nov. 13. 
		 Investigators are trying to establish whether Salah was supposed to carry out an attack in Paris's 18th district, the prosecutor said. In its statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack there that did not happen. 
		 The last person known to have seen Abdeslam, Ali Oulkadi, said he gave him a lift across Brussels on Nov. 14 and when he dropped him off Abdeslam said: "You'll never see me again." 
		 Some media relayed speculation at the end of November that Salah Abdeslam may have already fled to Syria. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls treated this as "rumour" on Dec. 1. 
		 Mohamed Abrini, 30, Belgian of Moroccan origin, seen by police on video footage with Salah on Nov. 11 at a fuel station in Ressons, north of Paris near the motorway linking Belgium to Paris. The Renault Clio in the footage was used in the attacks. 
		 A Belgian police notice describes Abrini, who has fought in Syria and came from the same area of Brussels area as the Abdeslam brothers and Abdelhamid Abaaoud, as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 Belgian media have reported that French prosecutors wanted to keep his name confidential so he would not learn he was the subject of a warrant but Belgian prosecutors released it minutes before a news conference during which Paris prosecutor Molins declined to reveal Abrini's name. 
		 DEAD ATTACKERS: 
		 Bataclan: (3 dead gunmen with suicide vests, two named) Ismail Omar Mostefai, 29 (born Nov. 21, 1985), Frenchman of Algerian descent involved in the Bataclan attack, lived for a time in Chartres area, southwest of Paris. Born in Courcouronnes, south of Paris. His name was put on French intelligence services' "S notice" in 2010 for reported radicalisation. An unnamed senior Turkish government official says Turkey contacted France about Mostefai in December 2014 and June 2015 but only got a return request for information on him after the Paris attacks.. 
		 Samy Amimour, 28 (born Oct. 15, 1987), involved in the Bataclan attack. French, from Drancy near St. Denis. Subject of an international arrest warrant since late 2013. He had been under official investigation since October 2012 on suspicion of terrorism-related activity over a plan to go to Yemen. Amimour, a bus driver who had been radicalised in a mosque near Drancy, was ordered by police to check in with them every week but missed four checks in 2013. After nearly a month, authorities put out the warrant for his arrest but he was already in Syria. Other: A third attacker in the Bataclan attack was shot dead by police. No further identity information has been provided. 
		 Cafe killings: (3 gunmen, 2 identified) Brahim Abdeslam, 31 (born July 30, 1984), French citizen but born and raised in Brussels, where he ran a bar in the Molenbeek district with his brother Salah. Blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in wake of the shootings. His fingerprints were on one of the AK-47 rifles left in a Seat Leon used in the attacks. 
		 Presumed ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, Belgian of Moroccan origin, grew up in the Molenbeek district of Brussels, but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria where he was one of Islamic State's most high-profile European recruits. Local media say he was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time in prison alongside Salah Abdeslam. Before the attacks, European governments believed Abaaoud was still in Syria. He had been in Belgium in January plotting attacks that were foiled when police raided a house in Verviers and killed two Belgian associates. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said on Nov. 24 that Abaaoud both took part in the cafe shootings and returned to the killing scenes while the Bataclan attack was still underway on the night of Nov. 13. He also said Abaaoud and another man were believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack on <mention id="1935">the La Defense business district</mention> in the west of Paris on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 Closed circuit TV footage showed Abaaoud entering the Croix de Chavaux metro railway station in eastern Paris with another man on Nov. 13, a couple of hundred metres from where the Seat Leon was found. His fingerprints were found on one of three AK-47 assault rifles in the car. 
		 According to a leaked transcript of a witness interviewed by police, Abbaoud spoke mockingly about having entered Europe from Syria via Greece two months before the attacks. The account, confirmed to Reuters by sources close to the investigation, also said Abbaoud had proposed that a cousin, who died alongside him in the Nov. 18 police raid, take 5,000 euros to buy suits and shoes for him and another man to enter <mention id="1936">the La Defense business district</mention> unnoticed. Other: a third gunman who took part in the cafe shootings has not been identified. Investigators say the DNA of a person who blew himself up during the Nov. 18 raid matches traces found on one of the AK-47 rifles in the abandoned Seat, and that may mean he is the third person who took part in the cafe shootings. Stade de France: (3 dead suicide bombers who used vests containing bolts, 1 named) Bilal Hadfi, 20 (born Jan 22, 1995). Blew himself up in the Nov. 13 attack on Stade de France stadium. He dropped out of school in Brussels in February 2014 to travel to Syria. Believing he was back, police bugged his apartment but he did not show up. Other: A man blew himself up outside Gate D at the Stade de France. A passport found near his dead body has the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, 25, (born Sept. 10, 1990), from Idlib, northwest Syria. His fingerprints match prints of a person registered under that name as arriving in Greece in Oct. 3, 2015. It has not been confirmed, however, that the bomber is the man in the passport. Other: The fingerprints of a third man who blew himself up outside Gate H of the Stade de France show that he passed through Greece at the same time as the other unidentified stadium suicide bomber. Police have published a photo in an appeal for help to identify the man. 
		 OTHER DEAD: 
		 Hasna Aitboulahcen: woman, 26, who suffocated under rubble in the Nov. 18 police assault in St. Denis, said prosecutor Molins. Police were tapping her phone as part of a drugs probe and watched her lead Abaaoud back to the apartment before the raid. Abaaoud and another man apparently called her in haste on Nov. 17 from where they were hiding in bushes to find them a hideout. 
		 Other: The third person who died in Nov. 18 St. Denis assault may have been the third gunmen involved in the cafe shootings but this has yet to be confirmed. 
		 DETAINED: 
		 In France: Jawad Bendaoud, one of eight arrested in St. Denis swoop, who provided lodgings for Abaaoud. Jawad told French TV as he was being led away to custody on Nov. 18 that he was unaware he had helped suspected terrorists. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said Bendaoud was in contact before and after the attacks with a person using a Belgian phone who was in turn in phone contact with the attackers. 
		 The other seven arrested, five of whom are thought to be squatters who had taken refuge in the same building, according to police sources, were released after questioning. 
		 In sweeps facilitated by state of emergency rules that apply until February 2016, police have searched 2,000 homes, taken 210 people into custody and discovered 320 weapons since the Nov. 13 attacks, Prime Minister Valls said on Dec. 1. 
		 These are in theory wide-net roundups of people who may have suspected links in some way or other to Islamist circles. There have been some accounts in local media of police excess, or mistaken raid addresses or identities. 
		 In Turkey: Ahmet Dahmani, a Belgian man of Moroccan origin suspected of some form of involvement in the Paris attack was arrested by police in Turkey on Nov. 21, a government official said. A Turkish news agency said he acted as a "scout" in selecting target locations. Dahmani, 26, was arrested at a luxury hotel in the southern Turkish coastal city of Antalya after travelling from Amsterdam on Nov. 14. Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, the official said. 
		 In Belgium: Six have been placed under formal investigation on terrorism-related charges after more than two dozen arrests. 
		 Mohammad Amri, 27, and Hamza Attouh, 21, went to Paris by car shortly after the attacks to fetch Salah Abdeslam and bring him back to Belgium on Nov. 14. 
		 Lazez Abraimi, 39, Moroccan living in western Brussels. His lawyers say he admits taking Salah somewhere in Brussels in his car but knows nothing else. Abraimi's brother is in Syria but he himself is not a radical. He deals in bric-a-brac, hence the two handguns in his car, one of which was a signal pistol. The blood in his car is not that of Salah, his lawyer says. 
		 Ali Oulkadi, 31, a Frenchman living in Molenbeek, western Brussels, accused of driving Salah in Brussels on Nov. 14. His lawyer says Oulkadi dropped him off north of the city centre. 
		 Fifth person. Age 35, from western Brussels. Detained in Brussels on Nov. 23. No other details. 
		 Sixth person. Detained in Brussels on Thursday. No details. 
		 Regarding Amri and Attouh, lawyer Xavier Carette said his client Amri was an unwitting accomplice who knew nothing about any role in attacks when he drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels on night of Nov. 13-14. A lawyer for Attouh quoted him as saying that Abdeslam was "extremely tense" and may have still been wearing a suicide belt under his down jacket. 
		 Mohammad Abdeslam, brother of Salah and dead Brahim, was among five released after arrests on Nov. 19. 
		 Police raided a house in Molenbeek looking for Salah on Sunday Nov. 29 after a hoax call. They arrested the caller. (Compiled by Brian Love with reporters in Paris and Brussels; editing by David Clarke)

		 PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants uncovered in a Paris suburb by police were planning an attack on <mention id="1938">the French capital's La Defense business district</mention>, a source close to the investigation and two police sources said on Wednesday.

		(Updates with new Belgian arrests, summary of French searches, edits) 
		 Dec 3 (Reuters) - France and Belgium are hunting suspects after the shootings and bombings on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and injured hundreds at a concert hall, soccer stadium, bars and restaurants across Paris. 
		 At least eight of the attackers are dead and the total number of assailants may have been 10 or higher. Investigations are centred on fugitive Salah Abdeslam, who police think may be an assailant referred to in an Islamic State statement claiming responsibility for the attacks.
		Here is what we know about the suspects and the wider circle pursued by police.

		* At least two die, seven arrested in pre-dawn raid 
		 * Investigators seeking alleged mastermind of Paris attacks 
		 * Group were planning to attack <mention id="1942">business district</mention> -sources 
		 * Some 33 Islamist State militants die in Syrian strikes
		By Antony Paone and Emmanuel Jarry 
		 SAINT DENIS, France, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and another militant died on Wednesday in a police raid that sources said had foiled a jihadi plan to hit <mention id="1943">Paris's business district</mention>, <mention id="1944">La Defense</mention>, days after attacks that killed 129 across the French capital. 
		 Police raided an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis in a hunt for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian Islamist militant accused of masterminding the bombings and shootings, but more than 12 hours later it was still unclear if they had found him. 
		 A source close to the investigation said the dead woman might have been Abaaoud's cousin. The interior ministry said forensic experts were looking to see whether a third person had died during the pre-dawn raid, indicating the rare violence of the confrontation that shredded the third floor apartment. 
		 Seven people were arrested in the operation, including three who were pulled from the residence in the heart of St. Denis, which had its windows blown out and its facade scarred by bullets and rocket blasts. 
		 "It is impossible to tell you who was arrested. We are in the process of verifying that," Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said at the end of the seven-hour police raid. 
		 Molins said the assault was ordered after phone taps and surveillance operations led police to believe that Abaaoud might have been in St. Denis, near to the soccer stadium which was one of the targets last Friday. 
		 Investigators believe the attacks -- the worst atrocity in France since World War Two -- was set in motion from Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St. Denis just before 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT). 
		 "We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake," said Sabrine, a downstairs neighbour from the apartment that was raided. 
		 She told Europe 1 radio that she heard the people above her talking to each other, running around and reloading their guns. 
		 Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion. 
		 "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up...," he told Reuters, without giving details. Three police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was also killed. 
		 FLEEING RAQQA 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the radicals and has launched three air strikes on Raqqa -- the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria -- since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Wednesday the bombardments have killed at least 33 Islamic State militants over the past three days. 
		 Citing activists, the Observatory said Islamic State members and dozens of families of senior members had started fleeing Raqqa to relocate to Mosul in neighbouring Iraq. 
		 French prosecutors have identified five of the seven dead assailants from Friday -- four Frenchmen and a man who was fingerprinted in Greece last month after arriving in the country via Turkey with a boatload of refugees fleeing the Syria war. 
		 Police believe two men directly involved in the assault subsequently escaped, including Salah Abdeslam, 26, a Belgian-based Frenchman who is accused of having played a central role in both planning and executing the deadly mission. 
		 French authorities said on Wednesday they had identified all the Nov. 13 victims. They came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. 
		 Empowered by a state of emergency introduced in France last Friday, police here have made hundreds of sweeps across the country over the past three days, arresting 60 suspects, putting 118 under house arrest and seizing 75 weapons. 
		 Until Wednesday morning, officials had said Abaaoud was in Syria. He grew up in Brussels, but media said he moved to Syria in 2014 to fight with Islamic State. Since then he has travelled back to Europe at least once and was involved in a series of planned attacks in Belgium foiled by the police last January. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters that the St. Denis cell was planning a fresh attack. "This new team was planning an attack on <mention id="1945">La Defense</mention>," one source said, referring to a high-rise neighbourhood on the outskirts of Paris that is home to top banks and businesses. 
		 A man in St. Denis told reporters that he had rented out the besieged apartment to two people last week. 
		 "Someone asked me a favour, I did them a favour. Someone asked me to put two people up for three days and I did them a favour, it's normal. I don't know where they came from I don't know anything," the man told Reuters Television. 
		 He was later arrested by police. 
		 AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
		 Global anxiety was reflected in a flurry of new security alerts on Wednesday after a soccer match between Germany and the Netherlands was cancelled on Tuesday evening in response to what a senior politician called a "concrete indication" of danger. 
		 Sweden raised its threat level by one step to four on a scale of five, the high-speed Eurostar train that connects Paris and London briefly suspended check-in at Paris's Gare du Nord and several German Bundesliga soccer teams said they were beefing up security ahead of their matches. 
		 The Russian air force on Wednesday carried out a "mass strike" on Islamic State positions around Syria, including Raqqa, Russian news agencies reported. 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Hollande will meet U.S. President Barack Obama, who says Russia must shift its focus from "propping up" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, two days before that in Washington. 
		 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Western nations had to drop their demands for Assad's exit if they wanted to build a coalition against Islamic State. 
		 Russia is allied to Assad but the West says he must go if there is to be a political solution to Syria's prolonged civil war. Hollande said countries should set aside their sometimes diverging national interests to battle their common foe. 
		 "The international community must rally around that spirit. I know very well that each country doesn't have the same interests," he told an assembly of city mayors on Wednesday. 
		 A French aircraft carrier group was headed to the eastern Mediterranean to intensify the number of strikes in Syria. Russia has said its navy will cooperate with this mission.

		(Adds details of ninth arrest in Belgium) 
		 Dec 10 (Reuters) - France and Belgium are hunting suspects after the shootings and bombings on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and injured hundreds at a rock concert hall, sports stadium and bars and restaurants in Paris. 
		 At least eight attackers are dead, wit seven killed in the attacks and one days later in a police raid. The number involved in the attacks may have been 10 or higher and at least four people are being sought, chief among them Salah Abdeslam, who police think may be an assailant referred to in an Islamic State statement claiming responsibility for the attacks.
		Here is what we know about the suspects and the wider circle pursued by police. 
		 KEY EVENTS: Nov 13: France. Seven assailants died during the attacks: three at the Bataclan concert hall, three outside the Stade de France stadium and one of three gunmen involved in the cafe shootings. Nov 18: France. Three people died and eight were arrested in a police assault on a hideout flat in St. Denis, north of Paris. One of the three was suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who played a direct role in the cafe shootings, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. UNACCOUNTED FOR: 
		 Salah Abdeslam, 26, French, born in Brussels (Sept. 15, 1989). Suspected of having rented the VW Polo and Renault Clio cars used in the attacks. Investigators say he went to Belgium from France the day after the attacks in a VW Golf, despite being stopped by French police along the way in routine road checks before his name was circulated as a suspect. 
		 His brother Brahim died in the attack (see below). 
		 Fears that Salah was back in Belgium and might be plotting attacks prompted the closure of Brussels underground rail lines, schools, shopping centres and other public places on Nov. 20. The shutdown was partially lifted on Nov. 25. 
		 French police are examining a suicide belt dumped in Montrouge on the southwestern fringes of Paris, where phone traces suggested Salah was present on the night of Nov. 13. 
		 Investigators are trying to establish whether Salah was supposed to carry out an attack in Paris's 18th district, the prosecutor said. In its statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack there that did not happen. 
		 The last person known to have seen Abdeslam, Ali Oulkadi, said he gave him a lift across Brussels on Nov. 14 and when he dropped him off Abdeslam said: "You'll never see me again." 
		 Some media relayed speculation at the end of November that Salah Abdeslam may have already fled to Syria. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls treated this as "rumour" on Dec. 1. 
		 Mohamed Abrini, 30, Belgian of Moroccan origin, seen by police on video footage with Salah on Nov. 11 at a fuelling station in Ressons, north of Paris, near the motorway linking Belgium to Paris. The Renault Clio in the footage was used in the attacks. 
		 A Belgian police notice describes Abrini, who has fought in Syria and came from the same area of Brussels as the Abdeslam brothers and Abdelhamid Abaaoud, as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 Belgian and French police are seeking two others who used forged Belgian ID papers under the names of Samir Bouzid and Soufiane Kayal. Belgian police said Salah Abdeslam made two trips to Budapest in a rental car during September 2015 and that the two men were spotted in a car with him at the border between Hungary and Austria on Sept. 9. A Belgian prosecutor statement contained a somewhat fuzzy photo of the two seemingly take from CCTV footage. Belgium said they may be armed and dangerous. 
		 The Kayal identity papers were used to rent a house in the Belgian town of Auvelais that police raided on Nov. 26. The Bouzid identity papers was used four days after the Nov. 13 attacks to wire 750 euros from a Western Union outlet in Brussels to a woman in France named Hasna Ait Boulahcen who was killed in the police raid on the St Denis flat. 
		 DEAD ATTACKERS: 
		 Bataclan concert hall: (3 dead gunmen with suicide vests. Two blew themselves up and a third was shot by police) 
		 Ismail Omar Mostefai, 29 (born Nov. 21, 1985), Frenchman of Algerian descent. Lived for a time in Chartres area, southwest of Paris. Born in Courcouronnes, south of Paris. His name was put on French intelligence services' "S notice" in 2010 for reported radicalisation. An unnamed senior Turkish government official says Turkey contacted France about Mostefai in December 2014 and June 2015 but only got a return request for information on him after the Paris attacks.. 
		 Samy Amimour, 28 (born Oct. 15, 1987). French, from Drancy near St. Denis. Subject of an international arrest warrant since late 2013. He had been under official investigation since October 2012 on suspicion of terrorism-related activity over a plan to go to Yemen. Amimour, a bus driver who had been radicalised in a mosque near Drancy, was ordered by police to check in with them every week but missed four checks in 2013. After nearly a month, authorities put out the warrant for his arrest but he was already in Syria. Foued Mohamed-Aggad, 23, French, from Strasbourg area of eastern France. Mother born in Morocco and father of Algerian descent. Police had been struggling to identify him until his mother made contact with investigators to say she had received an SMS from Syria announcing he died on Nov. 13. He was identified when policy matched his DNA with hers. 
		 Went to Syria in late with his brother Karim and a group of friends from his neighbourhood in late 2013. Karim, who is in jail in France, was among seven who returned from Syria and were arrested in May 2014. 
		 Several people from his home town of Wissembourg, 70 km north of Strasbourg, gave snippets of information about him - among them that he narrowly failed a police entrance exam and was rejected by the army. His mother raised her three children on her own after separating from the father some 10 years ago. 
		 Cafe killings: (3 gunmen, 2 identified) Brahim Abdeslam, 31 (born July 30, 1984), French citizen but born and raised in Brussels, where he ran a bar in the Molenbeek district with his brother Salah. Blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in wake of the shootings. His fingerprints were on one of the AK-47 rifles left in a Seat Leon used in the attacks. 
		 Presumed ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, Belgian of Moroccan origin, grew up in Molenbeek but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria, where he was one of Islamic State's most high-profile European recruits. Local media say he was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time in prison alongside Salah Abdeslam. Before the attacks, European governments believed Abaaoud was still in Syria. He had been in Belgium in January plotting attacks that were foiled when police raided a house in Verviers and killed two Belgian associates. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said on Nov. 24 that Abaaoud both took part in the cafe shootings and returned to the killing scenes while the Bataclan attack was still under way on the night of Nov. 13. He also said Abaaoud and another man were believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack on <mention id="1946">the La Defense business district</mention> in the west of Paris on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 Closed circuit TV footage showed Abaaoud entering the Croix de Chavaux metro railway station in eastern Paris with another man on Nov. 13, a couple of hundred metres from where the Seat Leon was found. His fingerprints were found on one of three AK-47 assault rifles in the car. 
		 According to a leaked transcript of a witness interviewed by police, Abaaoud spoke mockingly about having entered Europe from Syria via Greece two months before the attacks. The account, confirmed to Reuters by sources close to the investigation, also said Abaaoud had proposed that a cousin, who died alongside him in the Nov. 18 police raid, take 5,000 euros to buy suits and shoes for him and another man to enter <mention id="1947">the La Defense business district</mention> unnoticed. Other: a third gunman who took part in the cafe shootings has not been identified. Investigators say the DNA of a person who blew himself up during the Nov. 18 raid matches traces found on one of the AK-47 rifles in the abandoned Seat, and that may mean he is the third person who took part in the cafe shootings. Stade de France: (3 dead suicide bombers who used vests containing bolts, 1 named) Bilal Hadfi, 20 (born Jan 22, 1995). Dropped out of school in Brussels in February 2014 to travel to Syria. Believing he was back, police bugged his apartment but he did not show up. Other: A man blew himself up outside Gate D at the Stade de France. A passport found near his dead body has the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, 25, (born Sept. 10, 1990), from Idlib, northwest Syria. His fingerprints match prints of a person registered under that name as arriving in Greece in Oct. 3, 2015. It has not been confirmed, however, that the bomber is the man in the passport. Other: The fingerprints of a third man who blew himself up outside Gate H of the Stade de France show that he passed through Greece at the same time as the other unidentified stadium suicide bomber. Police have published a photo in an appeal for help to identify the man. 
		 OTHER DEAD: 
		 Hasna Ait Boulahcen: woman, 26, who suffocated under rubble in the Nov. 18 police assault in St. Denis. Police were tapping her phone as part of a drugs probe and watched her lead Abaaoud back to the apartment before the raid. Abaaoud and another man apparently called her in haste on Nov. 17 from where they were hiding in bushes to find them a hideout. 
		 Other: The third person who died in the St. Denis raid may have been the third gunman involved in the cafe shootings, but this has yet to be confirmed. 
		 DETAINED: 
		 In France: Jawad Bendaoud, one of eight arrested in St. Denis swoop, who provided lodgings for Abaaoud. Jawad told French TV as he was being led away to custody on Nov. 18 that he was unaware he had helped suspected terrorists. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said Bendaoud was in contact before and after the attacks with a person using a Belgian phone who was in turn in phone contact with the attackers. 
		 The other seven arrested, five of whom are thought to be squatters who had taken refuge in the same building, according to police sources, were released after questioning. 
		 In sweeps facilitated by state of emergency rules that apply until February 2016, police have searched 2,235 homes, taken 232 people into custody and discovered 334 weapons, 34 of them war-grade, since the Nov. 13 attacks, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Dec. 2. 
		 These are in theory wide-net roundups of people who may have suspected links in some way or other to Islamist circles. There have been some accounts in media of police excess, or mistaken raid addresses or identities. 
		 In Turkey: Ahmet Dahmani, a Belgian man of Moroccan origin suspected of some form of involvement in the Paris attack, was arrested by police in Turkey on Nov. 21, a government official said. A Turkish news agency said he acted as a "scout" in selecting target locations. Dahmani, 26, was arrested at a luxury hotel in the southern Turkish coastal city of Antalya after travelling from Amsterdam on Nov. 14. Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, the official said. 
		 In Belgium: Nine have been placed under formal investigation on terrorism-related charges after more than two dozen arrests. 
		 Mohammad Amri, 27, and Hamza Attouh, 21, went to Paris by car shortly after the attacks to fetch Salah Abdeslam and bring him back to Belgium on Nov. 14. 
		 Lazez Abraimi, 39, Moroccan living in western Brussels. His lawyers say he admits taking Salah somewhere in Brussels in his car but knows nothing else. They say Abraimi's brother is in Syria but he himself is not a radical. They explain the discovery of two handguns in his car by the fact he deals in bric-a-brac. Blood found in his car is not that of Salah, his lawyer says. 
		 Ali Oulkadi, 31, a Frenchman living in Molenbeek, western Brussels, accused of driving Salah in Brussels on Nov. 14. His lawyer says Oulkadi dropped him off north of the city centre. 
		 Abdellah Chouaa, 35, Belgian national. Belgian broadcaster RTBF says Chouaa saw off Mohamed Abrini at the airport when the latter left to fight in Syria. His phone number was also found with a detainee at Belgium's Namur prison who was contacted by Salah Abdeslam on the day of the attacks in Paris. Chaouaa denies any involvement, his lawyer told Reuters. 
		 Man named as Mohamed B. Detained in Brussels on Nov. 26. 
		 Samir Z, born in 1995, a Frenchman detained at Brussels airport on Nov. 29 as he was boarding a plane for Morocco. He is suspected of having tried to go to Syria at least twice in 2015 and is believed to be part of Bilal Hadfi's group. 
		 Pierre N., born in 1987, detained at his home in Molenbeek on Nov. 29. 
		 Regarding Amri and Attouh, lawyer Xavier Carette said his client Amri was an unwitting accomplice who knew nothing about any role in attacks when he drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels on the night of Nov. 13-14. A lawyer for Attouh quoted him as saying that Abdeslam was "extremely tense" and may have still been wearing a suicide belt under his down jacket. 
		 Abdoullah C., born 1985, Belgian national. Detained on Dec. 22. Suspected of having been in contact with Hasna Ait Boulahcen in the period between the attacks and the raids in Saint-Denis. 
		 Mohammad Abdeslam, brother of Salah and the dead Brahim, was among five people released after arrests on Nov. 19. 
		 Police raided a house in Molenbeek looking for Salah on Nov. 29 after a hoax call. They arrested the caller. (Compiled by Brian Love with reporters in Paris and Brussels)

<titre>Ringleader of Paris attacks planned more strikes, mocked open borders - sources</titre>

<texte>
		PARIS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The ringleader behind the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris had plans to strike Jewish targets and to disrupt schools and the transport system in France, according to sources close to the investigation. 
		 Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national of Moroccan origin, also boasted of the ease with which he had re-entered Europe from Syria via Greece two months earlier, exploiting the confusion of the migrant crisis and the continent's passport-free Schengen system, the sources said on Friday.
		Their comments, confirming excerpts from a confidential police witness statement leaked to a French magazine this week, fleshed out a picture of the Islamic State militant who spearheaded the Nov. 13 attacks targeting cafes, a concert hall and sports stadium in Paris in which 130 people were killed. 
		 The witness statement, quoted in the Valeurs Actuelles weekly magazine, describes how Abaaoud approached his cousin Hasna Ait Boulahcen two days after the killing spree asking her to hide him while he prepared further attacks. 
		 Both Abaaoud and Boulahecen died on Nov. 18 in a shootout with police in St. Denis north of Paris at an apartment where the militant Islamist had been staying. 
		 Speaking of the planned future attacks, Abaaoud told his cousin on Nov. 15 that "they would do worse (damage) in districts close to the Jews and would disrupt transport and schools", the witness statement said. 
		 Abaaoud said he would give Boulahecen 5,000 euros ($5,289.50) to buy two suits and two pairs of shoes for him and an unidentified accomplice to "look the part" in a planned attack on <mention id="1948">Paris' commercial district La Defense</mention>. 
		 Paris prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed on Tuesday the militants had been plotting to attack <mention id="1949">La Defense</mention> on Nov. 18. Reuters had previously reported the planned attack. 
		 The witness statement also described how Abaaoud had boasted about slipping into Europe with refugees fleeing Syria's civil war and then spending two months in France undetected prior to the Nov. 13 attacks. 
		 "France - zero," it quoted him as saying. 
		 On Friday, the Paris prosecutor's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into how the confidential police witness statement was leaked to the press.

		PARIS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Tourism in Paris is starting to recover, French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, after hotel bookings slumped following the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people. 
		 Daily occupancy at hotels in Paris fell 24 percentage points on average in the week after the attacks claimed by Islamic State militants, according to figures given by the Office du Tourisme et des Congres de Paris on Wednesday. But the decline had eased to 16 points on Nov. 22 and Nov. 23, it said.
		Airline booking cancellation levels were also back to normal this week from a slump right after the attacks, the Office said. 
		 "The situation is improving, a return to normal is underway this week," Macron said during a visit to the <mention id="1952">La Defense business district to the west of Paris</mention>. 
		 Prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed on Tuesday that attack ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, killed in a police raid last week, was believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack in <mention id="1953">La Defense</mention> on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 "It's picking up. We are on a seasonal market, so it is crucial that it picks up quickly for these operators that are open only for a few weeks during the holidays," Macron said. 
		 The Chambre du Commerce et de L'Industrie de Paris-Ile-de-France (CCI) has said that revenue at hotels in the Paris region slumped 50 percent in the week following the attacks and footfall dropped 30 to 50 percent at large stores. 
		 Some hoteliers were more circumspect than the minister. Christian Navet, president of the Paris-Ile de France section of French hotel federation (UMIH), said he saw "no signs of recovery". 
		 "We had cancellations right after the attacks, but now it's just people not coming. Hotels are empty. All eyes are now on Christmas," he told Reuters. 
		 Macron said it was too early to estimate the financial impact the attacks would have on the tourism sector, as much hinged on the pace of the recovery. 
		 French department store Printemps Haussmann, which makes 20 percent of its sales over Christmas, told Reuters that footfall was down 15 percent on Saturday, Nov. 21, following a drop of 30 percent in the week after attacks. 
		 "Traffic is coming back slowly, it's encouraging," a spokeswoman for the department store said. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, Marine Pennetier; additional reporting by Pascale Denis; editing by David Clarke, Larry King)

		(Adds details of 10th arrest in Belgium) 
		 Dec 31 (Reuters) - France and Belgium are hunting suspects after the shootings and bombings on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and injured hundreds at a rock concert hall, sports stadium and bars and restaurants in Paris. 
		 At least eight attackers are dead, wit seven killed in the attacks and one days later in a police raid. The number involved in the attacks may have been 10 or higher and at least four people are being sought, chief among them Salah Abdeslam, who police think may be an assailant referred to in an Islamic State statement claiming responsibility for the attacks.
		Here is what we know about the suspects and the wider circle pursued by police. 
		 KEY EVENTS: Nov 13: France. Seven assailants died during the attacks: three at the Bataclan concert hall, three outside the Stade de France stadium and one of three gunmen involved in the cafe shootings. Nov 18: France. Three people died and eight were arrested in a police assault on a hideout flat in St. Denis, north of Paris. One of the three was suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who played a direct role in the cafe shootings, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. UNACCOUNTED FOR: 
		 Salah Abdeslam, 26, French, born in Brussels (Sept. 15, 1989). Suspected of having rented the VW Polo and Renault Clio cars used in the attacks. Investigators say he went to Belgium from France the day after the attacks in a VW Golf, despite being stopped by French police along the way in routine road checks before his name was circulated as a suspect. 
		 His brother Brahim died in the attack (see below). 
		 Fears that Salah was back in Belgium and might be plotting attacks prompted the closure of Brussels underground rail lines, schools, shopping centres and other public places on Nov. 20. The shutdown was partially lifted on Nov. 25. 
		 French police are examining a suicide belt dumped in Montrouge on the southwestern fringes of Paris, where phone traces suggested Salah was present on the night of Nov. 13. 
		 Investigators are trying to establish whether Salah was supposed to carry out an attack in Paris's 18th district, the prosecutor said. In its statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack there that did not happen. 
		 The last person known to have seen Abdeslam, Ali Oulkadi, said he gave him a lift across Brussels on Nov. 14 and when he dropped him off Abdeslam said: "You'll never see me again." 
		 Some media relayed speculation at the end of November that Salah Abdeslam may have already fled to Syria. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls treated this as "rumour" on Dec. 1. 
		 Mohamed Abrini, 30, Belgian of Moroccan origin, seen by police on video footage with Salah on Nov. 11 at a fuelling station in Ressons, north of Paris, near the motorway linking Belgium to Paris. The Renault Clio in the footage was used in the attacks. 
		 A Belgian police notice describes Abrini, who has fought in Syria and came from the same area of Brussels as the Abdeslam brothers and Abdelhamid Abaaoud, as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 Belgian and French police are seeking two others who used forged Belgian ID papers under the names of Samir Bouzid and Soufiane Kayal. Belgian police said Salah Abdeslam made two trips to Budapest in a rental car during September 2015 and that the two men were spotted in a car with him at the border between Hungary and Austria on Sept. 9. A Belgian prosecutor statement contained a somewhat fuzzy photo of the two seemingly take from CCTV footage. Belgium said they may be armed and dangerous. 
		 The Kayal identity papers were used to rent a house in the Belgian town of Auvelais that police raided on Nov. 26. The Bouzid identity papers was used four days after the Nov. 13 attacks to wire 750 euros from a Western Union outlet in Brussels to a woman in France named Hasna Ait Boulahcen who was killed in the police raid on the St Denis flat. 
		 DEAD ATTACKERS: 
		 Bataclan concert hall: (3 dead gunmen with suicide vests. Two blew themselves up and a third was shot by police) 
		 Ismail Omar Mostefai, 29 (born Nov. 21, 1985), Frenchman of Algerian descent. Lived for a time in Chartres area, southwest of Paris. Born in Courcouronnes, south of Paris. His name was put on French intelligence services' "S notice" in 2010 for reported radicalisation. An unnamed senior Turkish government official says Turkey contacted France about Mostefai in December 2014 and June 2015 but only got a return request for information on him after the Paris attacks.. 
		 Samy Amimour, 28 (born Oct. 15, 1987). French, from Drancy near St. Denis. Subject of an international arrest warrant since late 2013. He had been under official investigation since October 2012 on suspicion of terrorism-related activity over a plan to go to Yemen. Amimour, a bus driver who had been radicalised in a mosque near Drancy, was ordered by police to check in with them every week but missed four checks in 2013. After nearly a month, authorities put out the warrant for his arrest but he was already in Syria. Foued Mohamed-Aggad, 23, French, from Strasbourg area of eastern France. Mother born in Morocco and father of Algerian descent. Police had been struggling to identify him until his mother made contact with investigators to say she had received an SMS from Syria announcing he died on Nov. 13. He was identified when policy matched his DNA with hers. 
		 Went to Syria in late with his brother Karim and a group of friends from his neighbourhood in late 2013. Karim, who is in jail in France, was among seven who returned from Syria and were arrested in May 2014. 
		 Several people from his home town of Wissembourg, 70 km north of Strasbourg, gave snippets of information about him - among them that he narrowly failed a police entrance exam and was rejected by the army. His mother raised her three children on her own after separating from the father some 10 years ago. 
		 Cafe killings: (3 gunmen, 2 identified) Brahim Abdeslam, 31 (born July 30, 1984), French citizen but born and raised in Brussels, where he ran a bar in the Molenbeek district with his brother Salah. Blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in wake of the shootings. His fingerprints were on one of the AK-47 rifles left in a Seat Leon used in the attacks. 
		 Presumed ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, Belgian of Moroccan origin, grew up in Molenbeek but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria, where he was one of Islamic State's most high-profile European recruits. Local media say he was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time in prison alongside Salah Abdeslam. Before the attacks, European governments believed Abaaoud was still in Syria. He had been in Belgium in January plotting attacks that were foiled when police raided a house in Verviers and killed two Belgian associates. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said on Nov. 24 that Abaaoud both took part in the cafe shootings and returned to the killing scenes while the Bataclan attack was still under way on the night of Nov. 13. He also said Abaaoud and another man were believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack on <mention id="1954">the La Defense business district</mention> in the west of Paris on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 Closed circuit TV footage showed Abaaoud entering the Croix de Chavaux metro railway station in eastern Paris with another man on Nov. 13, a couple of hundred metres from where the Seat Leon was found. His fingerprints were found on one of three AK-47 assault rifles in the car. 
		 According to a leaked transcript of a witness interviewed by police, Abaaoud spoke mockingly about having entered Europe from Syria via Greece two months before the attacks. The account, confirmed to Reuters by sources close to the investigation, also said Abaaoud had proposed that a cousin, who died alongside him in the Nov. 18 police raid, take 5,000 euros to buy suits and shoes for him and another man to enter <mention id="1955">the La Defense business district</mention> unnoticed. Other: a third gunman who took part in the cafe shootings has not been identified. Investigators say the DNA of a person who blew himself up during the Nov. 18 raid matches traces found on one of the AK-47 rifles in the abandoned Seat, and that may mean he is the third person who took part in the cafe shootings. Stade de France: (3 dead suicide bombers who used vests containing bolts, 1 named) Bilal Hadfi, 20 (born Jan 22, 1995). Dropped out of school in Brussels in February 2015 to travel to Syria. Believing he was back, police bugged his apartment but he did not show up. Other: A man blew himself up outside Gate D at the Stade de France. A passport found near his dead body has the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, 25, (born Sept. 10, 1990), from Idlib, northwest Syria. His fingerprints match prints of a person registered under that name as arriving in Greece in Oct. 3, 2015. It has not been confirmed, however, that the bomber is the man in the passport. Other: The fingerprints of a third man who blew himself up outside Gate H of the Stade de France show that he passed through Greece at the same time as the other unidentified stadium suicide bomber. Police have published a photo in an appeal for help to identify the man. 
		 OTHER DEAD: 
		 Hasna Ait Boulahcen: woman, 26, who suffocated under rubble in the Nov. 18 police assault in St. Denis. Police were tapping her phone as part of a drugs probe and watched her lead Abaaoud back to the apartment before the raid. Abaaoud and another man apparently called her in haste on Nov. 17 from where they were hiding in bushes to find them a hideout. 
		 Other: The third person who died in the St. Denis raid may have been the third gunman involved in the cafe shootings, but this has yet to be confirmed. 
		 DETAINED: 
		 In France: Jawad Bendaoud, one of eight arrested in St. Denis swoop, who provided lodgings for Abaaoud. Jawad told French TV as he was being led away to custody on Nov. 18 that he was unaware he had helped suspected terrorists. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said Bendaoud was in contact before and after the attacks with a person using a Belgian phone who was in turn in phone contact with the attackers. 
		 The other seven arrested, five of whom are thought to be squatters who had taken refuge in the same building, according to police sources, were released after questioning. 
		 In sweeps facilitated by state of emergency rules that apply until February 2016, police have searched 2,235 homes, taken 232 people into custody and discovered 334 weapons, 34 of them war-grade, since the Nov. 13 attacks, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Dec. 2. 
		 These are in theory wide-net roundups of people who may have suspected links in some way or other to Islamist circles. There have been some accounts in media of police excess, or mistaken raid addresses or identities. 
		 In Turkey: Ahmet Dahmani, a Belgian man of Moroccan origin suspected of some form of involvement in the Paris attack, was arrested by police in Turkey on Nov. 21, a government official said. A Turkish news agency said he acted as a "scout" in selecting target locations. Dahmani, 26, was arrested at a luxury hotel in the southern Turkish coastal city of Antalya after travelling from Amsterdam on Nov. 14. Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, the official said. 
		 In Belgium: Ten have been placed under formal investigation on terrorism-related charges after more than two dozen arrests. 
		 Mohammad Amri, 27, and Hamza Attouh, 21, went to Paris by car shortly after the attacks to fetch Salah Abdeslam and bring him back to Belgium on Nov. 14. 
		 Lazez Abraimi, 39, Moroccan living in western Brussels. His lawyers say he admits taking Salah somewhere in Brussels in his car but knows nothing else. They say Abraimi's brother is in Syria but he himself is not a radical. They explain the discovery of two handguns in his car by the fact he deals in bric-a-brac. Blood found in his car is not that of Salah, his lawyer says. 
		 Ali Oulkadi, 31, a Frenchman living in Molenbeek, western Brussels, accused of driving Salah in Brussels on Nov. 14. His lawyer says Oulkadi dropped him off north of the city centre. 
		 Abdellah Chouaa, 35, Belgian national. Belgian broadcaster RTBF says Chouaa saw off Mohamed Abrini at the airport when the latter left to fight in Syria. His phone number was also found with a detainee at Belgium's Namur prison who was contacted by Salah Abdeslam on the day of the attacks in Paris. Chaouaa denies any involvement, his lawyer told Reuters. 
		 Man named as Mohammed B. Detained in Brussels on Nov. 26. Had detention extended for three months on Dec. 31. 
		 Samir Z, born in 1995, a Frenchman detained at Brussels airport on Nov. 29 as he was boarding a plane for Morocco. He is suspected of having tried to go to Syria at least twice in 2015 and is believed to be part of Bilal Hadfi's group. 
		 Pierre N., born in 1987, detained at his home in Molenbeek on Nov. 29. 
		 Regarding Amri and Attouh, lawyer Xavier Carette said his client Amri was an unwitting accomplice who knew nothing about any role in attacks when he drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels on the night of Nov. 13-14. A lawyer for Attouh quoted him as saying that Abdeslam was "extremely tense" and may have still been wearing a suicide belt under his down jacket. 
		 Abdoullah C., born 1985, Belgian national. Detained on Dec. 22. Suspected of having been in contact with Hasna Ait Boulahcen in the period between the attacks and the raids in Saint-Denis. 
		 Ayoub B., a Belgian national born in 1993. Detained on Dec. 30. Charged with terrorist murder and belonging to a terrorist organisation. A number of mobile phones were found at his home. 
		 Mohamed Abdeslam, brother of Salah and the dead Brahim, was among five people released after arrests on Nov. 19. 
		 Police raided a house in Molenbeek looking for Salah on Nov. 29 after a hoax call. They arrested the caller. (Compiled by Brian Love with reporters in Paris and Brussels)

		 ABSTRACT 
		 ESA performance testing protocols are mainly a set of exposure conditions, monitoring strategy, and specimens configuration. Although the large feedback on the representativeness of exposure conditions and the relevance of monitored parameters, the effect of specimen configuration still deserved to be studied. In order to investigate the effect of composition and geometry on ESA degradation progress and performance evaluation, an experimental campaign was conducted in this study. Among the 8 tested specimen configurations, 5 geometries (prismatic, cylindrical and 3 hollow cylindrical geometries) and 3 compositions (concrete, concrete equivalent mortar and standard mortar), the cylindrical mortar specimen was selected as the most adapted configuration, in term of ESA degradation expression, for the adopted performance testing procedure. The different configurations lead to the same overall mechanism of degradation but the geometry and the composition influenced the magnitude of some chemical or physical degradation parameters, due to couplings between chemical and mechanical degradation.

		 External sulfate attack 
		 Performance indicator 
		 Specimen geometry 
		 Aggregates 
		 1. Introduction 
		 Sulfates present in groundwater or soils surrounding a concrete structure seriously affect its durability. In order to design the most durable structure with the lowest maintenance costs, durability specifications take progressively larger sections in standards. Different kinds of durability specifications have been established. Prescriptive or "deemed-to-satisfy" approaches were first adopted in standards. They consist in recommending mixtures that have been already tested on sites for long time and showed an acceptable durability when exposed to environmental actions. However, new cement and concrete mixtures are being developed by cement and concrete industries to meet new technical and environmental requirements. These cement-based materials cannot be qualified using the prescriptive approach. Thus new technologies are needed to follow the rhythm of innovation in the construction industry. Numerous laboratory studies have been conducted to optimize testing procedures and related indicators and develop reliable performance-based specifications [1-5]. 
		 The sulfate resistance level of cements can be assessed by preparing realistic concrete specimens and exposing them to conditions which are representative of field conditions. Unfortunately, unless the concretes are of low quality (high W/C, poorly compacted) several years of exposure is required to provide any meaningful discrimination between resistant and non-resistant cements [6,7]. Consequently there is a need for accelerated test procedures or analysis to provide reliable assessment within a timescale of weeks or months. 
		 Many configurations of external sulfate attack (ESA) performance tests were developed, showing various combinations of exposure conditions, monitoring strategies, and specimen compositions and geometry (Fig. 1). Some existing experimental ESA protocols are described in standards ASTM C1012, GOST 4789 prescribed protocols, and others adopted at national level such as SVA, Wittekindt (VDZ modified) (1960), Koch and Steinegger, SIA 262/1 protocols [8], etc. 
		 Exposure conditions 
		 In typical ESA performance tests as described in the literature [9-11], the specimens are exposed to aqueous solutions of magnesium, calcium, or sodium sulfate of various concentrations. The temperature and sometimes the pH are controlled. The specimen is exposed to wet/dry cycles, to partial immersion, or to continuous immersion, involving different mechanisms of degradation [12-14]. 
		 Monitoring strategy 
		 The expansion of samples exposed to sulfate solution forms till present the most widely adopted performance criterion for the durability classification, in addition to other familiar parameters monitoring such as mass, compressive strength, flexural strength and specimens visual appearance. Nondestructive techniques such as elastic dynamic modulus and ultrasonic pulse velocity are also used [15-19]. For the new cements incorporating supplementary materials (especially slag and fly ash) microscopic chemical degradation are likely to become more pronounced in the degradation process without revealing macroscopic manifestations as swelling. Thus monitoring strategies have been oriented towards microscopic analysis through DRX, TGA, SEM and EDS [20,21], Other monitoring approaches consist of the combination between macroscopic and chemical monitoring parameters to estimate microscopic evolutions [22], The analysis performed in this study allows to describe the ESA degradation mechanism from the mineralogical evolutions to mechanical damage of the specimens induced by crystallisation pressure [23], in a way to get general indicators of the performance of tested materials [24]. 
		 Configuration of specimens 
		 Many specimen compositions such as cement paste, mortar or concrete are adopted in the existing performance tests. They depend on the objective of the study, the monitoring procedure, and existing experimental devices specifications. For microscopic mineralogical characterization for example, aggregates-free compositions are more adapted [25], During ESA, the cement paste reactivity is mainly responsible of the physicochemical properties evolution at the different scales. The various granular skeletons induce different pore networks and different interfacial transition zones (ITZ) between aggregates and paste impacting the ions transport and physical properties inside the specimens. 
		 Different geometries and sizes of specimens are used. Prismatic, cylindrical even spherical specimens of various dimensions were actually designed [3,26]. Even molds and casting methods induce different types of heterogeneities. Physicochemical and mechanical heterogeneities are likely to influence specimen performances even for a given tested composition under controlled exposure conditions. 
		 Composition and geometry of tested specimens are major parameters related to the tests acceleration in literature, without paying enough attention to their influence on the ESA mechanism and the assessment of cementitious materials durability, which is the objective of the study presented in this paper. The configurations of ions transport actually depend on specimens geometries and compositions, thus different thermodynamic equilibrium could be set inducing different mineralogical evolutions inside the specimens. 
		 Despite many studies and research projects aiming to develop relevant ESA experimental performance tests, the definition of tested specimens has not come to a consensus among concerned research committees. For instance, European Committee of Standardization I Technical committee 51 (CEN / TC51) has provided guidelines in CEN / Technical Report 15697:2008 [27], In this report over then 250 papers and reports published during the period 1970-2006 were identified to assess the different sulfate resistance techniques employed and their possible influence on the cement performance evaluation. The objective of this report was to review existing performance specifications and test methods on sulfate attack, to provide the technical basis for improved performance standards, and to provide criteria for evaluation, selection, and use of cementitious materials for sulfate attack resistance. The main experimental choices made in the experimental study, such as exposure conditions and monitoring strategy, are in agreement with their recommendations. The influence of composition and geometry of tested specimens on the chemical and physical evolutions induced by the main phenomena of ESA were assessed through the method designed by Massaad et al. [24]. 
		 First the experimental program is described. Five specimens geometries and three compositions were studied in this work. The exposure conditions were characterized by controlled pH and realistic sulfate concentration [3]. Then the main steps of monitoring strategy approach and indicators are defined [24]. The analysis and discussion of the experimental results first deal with the effect of geometry then aggregate size. For each parameter some recommendations are finally given. 
		 2. Experimental program 
		 Five geometries of specimens and three compositions were studied in this work. The variation of these parameters is likely to influence the behavior and relative performance of specimens, even by keeping the exposure conditions and the composition of cement paste constant for all the specimens. NSR cement, known as non-sulfate resisting cement, was used for all the tested specimens. The best specimen geometry and composition, capable to provide a reliable assessment of the expected performance of NSR, will be selected as the most convenient and relevant specimen configuration to be associated to the adopted performance monitoring approach [24]. 
		 2.2. Materials 
		 The Table 1 gives the mineralogical composition of the CEM I 52.5 Portland cement used in both parts of the study. It was considered as non-sulfate resisting (NSR) cement due to its relatively high [C.sub.3]A and [C.sub.3]S contents. 
		 2.2. Tested geometries 
		 The different geometries of the specimens (Fig. 2) induce different configurations of the ionic diffusion and different mechanical behaviors during the ESA. The various shapes of the exposed surfaces and sections are likely to induce different mineralogical evolutions inside the specimens. In the case of prismatic specimens, for example, the corners present the most active ion exchange zones [28]. This may favor the leaching and destabilization of precipitated sulfate minerals at the corners. In the case of axisymmetric geometries, the ionic diffusion fields are different, thus different extent of leaching and precipitation processes are expected. 
		 The rate of specimens degradation is directly related to the ratio of surface exposed to sulfate solution and their volume [29], As a consequence the surface/volume ratio (exposure radius) was the same for all the tested specimens (Table 2). As the exposure conditions were the same, the different physiochemical evolutions (weight, elongation, leached and precipitated minerals, etc.) of mortar specimens could mainly be attributed to the various ionic diffusion and mechanical properties corresponding to the tested geometries. 
		 The prismatic and cylindrical solid specimens are the most commonly used in sulfate attack tests. The hollow cylinders geometry was studied in order to accelerate the response of the specimens exposed to the ESA. This geometry could promote the diffusion of the sulfate ions in the cementitious paste exposed to the sulfate solution from inner and outer surfaces of the specimen. However, with a common exposure radius for all the geometries, the acceleration of the response is not obvious and requires the analysis carried out in the following section. The size effect is also included in this study, as C30, C40 and C50 hollow cylinders had the same width and outer section diameters going from almost 30-50 mm. 
		 2.3. Tested granular skeletons 
		 As aggregates influence the behaviour of cement-based materials exposed to ESA, the choice of granular skeleton must be taken into account to design performance tests. Three compositions were tested in this study (Fig. 3). They had the same cement and water-to-cement ratio but different granular skeletons. Siliceous aggregates were used to avoid coupled degradations due to calcium carbonate [30] in case of use of limestone aggregates. The radius of the three sets of cylindrical specimens was 45 mm and their length was 160 mm. They were stored 28 days in saturated lime water before testing. 
		 ISO mortar mixture was designed from the normalized mortar (EN 196-1) but with a W/C ratio of 0.6 instead of 0.5 while keeping the volume of cement paste constant (Table 2). Quarzite aggregates of different particle size distributions were used to design CON and CEM mixtures (Table 3). CON was a concrete mixture with maximum aggregate size of 12 mm. Reducing the maximum aggregate size from 20 mm (more common for concrete) to 12 mm allowed reducing the cross section while keeping a representative volume of material. The radius of the tested cylinders was 50 mm, i.e. nearly five times the maximum aggregates size. In order to shorten testing time, ESA tests are often carried out on thinner specimens, thus maximum aggregate size must be reduced. In order to study this parameter, a Concrete Equivalent Mortar (CEM) mixture was designed by replacing coarse aggregates (4/8 and 8/12 mm fractions) by fine aggregates (0/4 mm) keeping the developed surface ([S.sub.d]) constant (Table 3). Thus the volume of paste increased but the volume of paste to developed surface ratio was kept constant. This approach was first developed to optimize concrete rheology at mortar scale [31]. 
		 2.4. Performance monitoring approach 
		 Specimen geometry and mix-proportioning parameters are likely to induce different physico-chemical and mechanical behaviors, at macroscopic and microscopic scales. A costly investigation of microstructure would be necessary to investigate these effects. Alternatively, a performance monitoring strategy can be used to characterize the changes at microstructure scale from macroscopic parameters [24]. This method allows quantifying and associating the macroscopic changes to the main mechanisms of ESA, namely: leaching, precipitation of sulfate-rich phases, aggregates loss, and cracking. 
		 2.4.1. ESA testing procedure 
		 The laboratory procedure (Fig. 4) consists in immersing the samples in a sodium sulfate solution (3 g/1 S[O.sup.2-.sub.4] concentration) at controlled constant temperature (20[degrees]C) and pH (7.5) [3], The pH control is made via nitric acid at 0.5 mol/1 added automatically to equilibrate the O[H.sup.-] leached from the cementitious matrix. The sulfate solution is changed every 20 ml of added acid. The temperature control is provided by a temperature-controlled liquid, circulating into the double-walled beakers containing samples. 
		 After each renewal of sulfate solution, the same measurements were made on samples exposed to sulfate solution and control samples, namely: mass, length, and hydrostatic weighing [24]. Hydrostatic weighing was carried out on samples immersed in their solution. Then they were wiped until saturated surface dried (SSD) state to measure the mass. Finally the length was assessed using LVDT sensor and invar reference bar. The quantity of leached OH" ions was directly assessed from the cumulated volumes of acid added to control the pH of sulfate solution. 
		 2.4.2. Inputs and outputs of monitoring procedure 
		 This part sums up the main parameters and the procedure used to analyse the experimental results and deduce the extent of changes induced by ESA in tested specimens. 
		 The mass at saturated surface dried state M and the hydrostatic weight (or apparent mass in water) [P.sub.hyd] were monitored then the specimens volume variation [DELTA]V (1) was deduced. 
		 [DELTA]V x [[rho].sub.water] = [DELTA]M - [DETA][P.sub.hyd] (1) 
		 Combining the relative volume variation z = [DELTA]V/[V.sub.0] to the relative length variation x = [DELTA]L/[L.sub.0], the relative cross section radius variation of the specimen y = [DELTA]R/[R.sub.0] could be calculated via the Eq. (2). 
		 y = [square root of (1 + z/1 + x)] - 1 (2) 
		 The combination of the selected monitoring parameters (Inputs in Table 4) allows the decoupling of the mass variations corresponding to each of the four main phenomena involved in ESA: leaching and precipitation of minerals, aggregate loss and free water variation inside the specimens during ESA. The Eq. (1) presents the global mass variation of specimens resulting from the previously described mass variations. These variations are expressed as a function of monitored parameters ([N.sub.lea] number of leached O[H.sup.-] in moles, [DELTA][P.sub.hyd.prec] hydrostatic weight variation due to minerals precipitation, in kg, [DELTA]V volume variation in [m.sup.3]) and a set of optimisation parameters ([Mo.sub.ap] apparent molar mass of leached minerals in kg/mol, [[rho].sub.prec] precipitated minerals averaged density in kg/[m.sup.3], [[rho].sub.lea] leached minerals averaged density in kg/ [m.sup.3], [f.sub.ag.lo] and [f.sub.lea.prec] two parameters correlated respectively to the aggregates loss and internal free water variation). [Mo.sub.ap] is the molar mass of leached mineral divided by the number of O[H.sup.-] ions released by the dissolution of each mole of leached mineral. 
		 The decoupling and calculations details were developed in previous work [24]. 
		 [mathematical expression not reproducible] (3) 
		 2.4.3. Performance indicators 
		 2.4.3.1. Averaged density. In order to gather the information collected at the macroscopic and microscopic levels in a single indicator deduced from the monitoring of performance tests, the "averaged density" indicator (2) was defined. The sum of the absolute mass variations generated by the four main phenomena of sulfate attack was divided by the sum of corresponding absolute volume variations. In this way, the obtained values at different times of sulfate attack test highlight the prevailing material and the corresponding phenomena causing the variations of mass and volume of cementitious materials. This allows describing the scenario of sulfate attack using a single indicator. 
		 AD = [[SIGMA].sup.4.sub.i=1][absolute value of [DELTA][m.sub.i]]/[[SIGMA].sup.4.sub.i=1][absolute value of [DELTA][v.sub.i]] (4) 
		 With AD the averaged density indicator, [absolute value of [DELTA][m.sub.i]] and [absolute value of [DELTA][v.sub.i]] the elemental absolute mass and volume variations corresponding to the four sulfate attack phenomena. 
		 2.4.3.2. Deformation path indicator. The deformation path corresponds to the absolute lateral vs. longitudinal deformation graph. It makes possible the classification of cement-based materials as a function of the magnitude of deformations (Fig. 10). This approach is useful when testing low-expansion materials. Even if the longitudinal deformation is negligible, radial deformation actually appears earlier and it is usually more sensitive to sulfate attack than longitudinal expansion. 
		 3. Results and discussion 
		 3.1. Influence of specimens geometry 
		 This part first presents the variations of experimentally assessed parameters (3.1.1) then the volume variations provided by the analysis procedure (3.1.2), which allows determining performance indicators (3.1.3) and discussing the choice of the geometry (3.1.4). 
		 3.1.1. Variations of monitored parameters 
		 The hydrostatic weight variation is due to the transformation of solid phases (leaching, precipitation and aggregates loss). The variation of specimens mass at SSD state depends on the simultaneous variations of the solid and liquid phases (cracking and porosity changes). 
		 Despite the same exposure radius and ESA exposure conditions, the tested geometries resulted in different rates and extent of mass and volume variations (Fig. 5). The decrease in hydrostatic weight is due to leaching of cement paste, which occurs during the first stage of ESA [1,3], Then swelling and cracking induce water uptake. This does not influence the hydrostatic weight variation, but it finally causes an increase in mass at SSD state, and even a positive mass variation showed on the mass monitoring curves of hollow specimens. 
		 According to the mass and hydrostatic weight variations, the tested geometries behaved differently exposed to ESA. The strong coupling between the ESA phenomena makes it difficult to identify and understand the causes for these differences in behavior, hence the importance of the applied monitoring strategy in the next part of this study, allowing the ESA phenomena decoupling. 
		 The tested hollow cylinders geometries had the same fluxes of leached O[H.sup.-] (Fig. 6). However, varying the geometry of the specimens significantly influenced the leaching of minerals (Fig. 6). PRI specimens showed the lowest leaching rate, whereas CYL showed an intermediate leaching potential. The loss of linearity at the end of the curves indicate significant damage and cracking of solid and hollow cylinders, which is consistent with mass increase observed on corresponding mass variations (Fig. 5). 
		 The ionic transport properties imposed by the tested geometries lead to different ionic transport properties as suggested by the varied O[H.sup.-] fluxes. These differences in ionic transport could influence chemical equilibrium in the interstitial solution of cement paste, inducing different leaching and precipitation reactions. At this stage varied microscopic evolutions according to the specimen geometry is still an assumption that microscopic assessment, via the developed procedure, could validate. 
		 3.1.2. Volume variations induced by main ESA phenomena 
		 3.1.2.1. Optimal parameters. The parameters monitored at the macroscopic level could give some direct indications on the mechanism and the degradations of the ESA. However, due to the strong coupling between the ESA phenomena, these parameters cannot be directly used to assess the materials performance and the phenomena contributing to the degradation. The adopted procedure first consists in calculating the parameters integrated in the mass variation Eq. (2) and presented in Table 5. The optimization procedure is detailed in [24]. 
		 The values of [Mo.sub.ap] and [[rho].sub.lea] parameters were practically the same indicating the same leached minerals for all the tested geometries. However the values of [[rho].sub.prec] were affected by the geometry. This suggests that the different shapes of sections imposed different diffusion-reaction fields and consequently different formed minerals. Under the ESA applied conditions, the tested material (NSR mortar) is expected to provide ettringite and gypsum as the two main sulfate minerals precipitated in the specimens. The proportions of these two precipitated minerals varied from one geometry to another. Gypsum appeared more clearly in hollow specimens, raising up the averaged precipitated minerals density towards the gypsum density ([[rho].sub.gypsum] = 2.32g/ml, [[rho].sub.ettringite] = 1.76 g/ml). 
		 Significant differences of [f.sub.ag,lo] parameter could be observed highlighting various aggregates loss potential related to the surface degradation properties. The prismatic specimens (PRI) showed the highest values reminding that corners are more exposed due to two-dimensional diffusion field and consequent leaching and aggregates loss. 
		 In the mass variation Eq. (1) the [f.sub.lea*prec] parameter is attributed to the specimen volume variation [DELTA]V to express the free water volume variation, giving indications on cracking in the case of expansive phases. To give a relevant interpretation for the obtained values of this parameter, it is better to represent the resulting free water variation, especially when the specimens show different volume variations. 
		 3.3.2.2. Contribution of main ESA phenomena to volume variations. The optimal values of output parameters obtained previously provide information on some microstructural evolutions. In order to obtain an overall view of the microscopic evolution, they can be combined to estimate the elementary volume variations corresponding to the different phenomena of the ESA (Fig. 7). 
		 The specimens showed approximately the same relative leached mineral volume variations, except the prismatic geometry. Despite the same exposure radius the prismatic geometry lead to slower leaching than the other geometries. 
		 The dependence of the aggregates loss on leaching is expressed in the global mass variation Eq. (1). [f.sub.ag*lo] parameter is actually combined to the O[H.sup.-] molar variations. Prismatic geometry (Table 5) showed the highest potential to loose aggregate from the point of view of [f.sub.ag*lo] parameter (Table 5), but as it was relatively less leached than the other specimens (Fig. 6), the estimated volume of lost aggregates was lower. The three hollow cylinders also showed different lost aggregates volumes (Table 5, Fig. 7). Despite the same rate of leached OH" (Fig. 6), the [f.sub.ag*lo] optimal values showed different potentials of these specimens to loose aggregates depending on the specimen size and surface properties. 
		 In agreement with the leaching volume variations, the PRI specimens showed the lowest rate of precipitation. At the beginning of tests the solid and hollow cylinders showed the same precipitation volume variation. Then at more advanced stages of degradation the precipitation rate of hollow cylinders was higher. The prismatic and solid cylindrical specimens showed lower leaching, aggregates loss, and precipitation than hollow cylinders. They also showed lower final values of free water volume increase, and lower rate during the second part of the tests. As leaching [32] and precipitation are favored by cracking, hollow cylinders would promote more intense cracking and coupled physico-chemical changes. 
		 Minerals leaching and precipitation are the driving forces of ESA. They are strongly coupled as the formation of ettringite for instance requires a source of calcium that can be provided by leached portlandite or CSH [33], Leached minerals and sulfate ingress cause ionic supersaturation in the interstitial water, contributing to the precipitation of sulfate minerals. ESA phenomena decoupling allows to verify the interaction between these phenomena and to show a linear correlation between the induced volume variations (Fig. 8). The volume ratio [DELTA][V.sub.prec]/[DELTA][V.sub.lea] was close to 3. 
		 3.1.3. Performance indicators 
		 3.1.3.1. Averaged density. The averaged density curves confirm the previously mentioned influence of geometry on the mineralogical evolution of the cementitious matrix (Fig. 9). The trends of the curves are practically the same. At the beginning of the tests, prior to cracking, the averaged density mainly depends on the density of leached, precipitated and lost aggregates minerals. The analysis shows relatively low values for the prismatic samples during the first weeks. This can be due to two-dimensional leaching and damage of the corners of the samples. The averaged densities are then stable. When cracking develops (around t = 80 days), the water uptake results in a decrease of the values of the averaged densities. 
		 Despite the similarities of the degradation mechanisms revealed by the trends of the averaged density curves, the mineralogical variations differ between the hollow and filled specimens. From the optimal values of [[rho].sub.prec] (Table 5), the hollow specimens would favour the destabilization of ettringite and its transformation into gypsum. This phase has actually a higher density than ettringite. This could explain the higher values found for the hollow specimens. Even if the same minerals were leached in all specimens, the higher density of precipitated minerals in hollow cylinders resulted in an increase of the averaged density. Even if the carbonation of saturated mortar is much slower than that of partially saturated material, the contact of C[O.sub.2] with the specimens cannot be prevented. As a result, calcite is likely to form in the leached areas of the specimen. Calcite has a higher density (2.71 kg/[dm.sup.3]) than both ettringite and gypsum. Thus, in order to evaluate the potential of a material to from ettringite during the tests, it would be preferable to choose the solid specimens. 
		 3.1.3.2. Deformation path. The deformation path corresponds to the absolute radial expansion vs. longitudinal expansion plot (Fig. 9). The decoupling of phenomena and the quantification of elementary mass/volume variations, especially that corresponding to the aggregate loss, allows estimating the absolute specimens radius variations. The equivalent lost radius thickness (due to the aggregate loss at the specimen surface) is actually added to the measured radius variations to get the positive absolute radius variation due to swelling. Fig. 10 shows that the different mortar specimens followed the same deformation/swelling mechanism. The deformations exceeded the tensile strain capacity of mortars. The tensile strain capacity of normal strength concrete is actually around 0.01% [29,34]. This confirms that macro-cracking occurred due to the stresses generated by crystallisation pressures [35], At the beginning of the tests, the radial expansion took place then the longitudinal expansion developed. The formation of expansive products in the external layer actually causes tensile stresses in the core of the specimens until reaching the tensile strength of the material. Hollow geometries (C30, C40 and C50) allowed reaching higher levels of deformation than solid ones (PRI and CYL) for the same ESA test duration This is consistent with previous observations, such as higher increase of free water volume (Fig. 7) and stronger decrease of averaged density (Fig. 9) due to water uptake through cracks. 
		 3.1.4. Recommendations 
		 The five different sets of specimens had the same exposure radius and they were made of the same NSR mortar. The results of the experimental study were analyzed through the performance monitoring approach. The five tested geometries lead to the same overall phenomenology of sulfate attack, in terms of leaching, precipitation, aggregates loss, and free water volume variations. This was confirmed by a common correlation between leached and precipitated volumes and between longitudinal and absolute radial deformation (deformation path). The magnitude of the physical and chemical changes was influenced by the geometry. For instance hollow specimens were more affected by cracking. The geometry of the specimens actually seems to influence their diffusion and mechanical properties, thus their degradation mechanism especially the type of precipitated minerals. 
		 Hollow cylinders were exposed to sulfate solution on two sides and this double diffusion affected the stability of ettringite. The corresponding values of [[rho].sub.prec] (density of precipitated mineral) were actually higher which means that the gypsum proportion was finally higher than in solid specimens. From these results it is recommended to adopt solid geometries, such as PRI and CYL, for a relevant assessment of ESA resistance. However corner degradation and flexural swelling mode could be observed on prismatic specimens, due to the heterogeneous composition of the specimen section shown at Fig. 11. Finally the solid cylinder can be considered as the most suitable geometry for the adopted performance monitoring strategy. 
		 3.2. Influence of specimen composition 
		 3.2.1. Macroscopic evolution 
		 Two behaviors can be observed on both graphs of Fig. 12. CON and CEM specimens showed approximately the same mass and volume variations. Their composition was characterized by the same [V.sub.p]/[S.sub.d] ratio and relatively coarser aggregates than the ISO composition. 
		 During ESA, the hydrostatic weight decreased for all the compositions. The variations induced by aggregates loss and leaching were actually higher than those induced by mineral precipitation, which explains the negative volume variation. ISO specimens showed two stages during the test. First, the hydrostatic weight was almost stable, and then dropped. This sudden variation could correspond to a significant material loss due to the damage of cementitious matrix affected by the transformation of mineral phases. This cannot be confirmed at this stage and more information will be given by applying the adopted performance monitoring approach. 
		 The variations of mass at SSD state are plotted on the second graph of Fig. 12. At the beginning of the test, the mass of CON and CEM specimens decreased then cracking occurred and changed negative variations into positive, due to the water infiltrated into the cracks. ISO showed the same decreasing mass variation throughout the test. Despite precipitation and cracking, the resulting ISO mass variation remains negative. 
		 Volume variations and radial expansion were estimated from experimental results using equations given in Section 2.4.2. CON and CEM specimens showed approximately the same expansions (Fig. 13). These compositions seemed more sensitive to minerals precipitation and expansion (E and V). ISO showed significantly lower lateral and volume variations. Its relatively fine granular skeleton, the French standard sand used in this composition, favored material loss during the ASE. This resulted in a decrease of the specimen radius and volume, and a relaxation of stresses generated by crystallisation pressures, slowing down the longitudinal expansion. Conversely the coarser aggregates of CON and CEM compositions promoted the development of crystallisation pressure and stresses induced in the cross section of the specimen. 
		 Fig. 14 shows a linear relationship between leached OH and absorbed S[O.sup.2-.sub.4] for the set of tested compositions. Despite the previously mentioned differences, the close O[H.sup.-]/S[O.sup.2-.sub.4] correlation curves confirm interdependent leaching and precipitation phenomena in the ESA mechanism. For the same testing duration. CEM composition showed the highest leached O[H.sup.-] and absorbed S[O.sub.4] fluxes (Fig. 14). Its 49% cement paste volume was significantly higher than CON and ISO paste volumes of respectively 34 and 40%. Thus CEM composition had a higher potential to exchange ions with the external solution. 
		 3.2.2. Microscopic induced volume variation inside the specimens 
		 3.2.2.1. Optimal parameters. [[rho].sub.lea] optimal values were the same for the three tested compositions (Table 6). The [Mo.sub.ap] values showed slight differences. Different O[H.sup.-] leaching modes and their various involvements in the sulfate minerals formation according to the precipitated minerals could explain these various [Mo.sub.ap] values. Despite these minor differences, the obtained optimal values of [Mo.sub.ap] and [[rho].sub.lea] suggest that portlandite was the main leached phase during ESA. 
		 The various ionic diffusion configurations imposed by the different granular skeletons are likely to influence the precipitated phases, which are revealed by the different estimated [[rho].sub.prec] (Table 6). In the case of CEM and ISO compositions the gypsum formation would be higher than the ettringite formation as [[rho].sub.prec] increased towards [[rho].sub.gypsum] = 2.32 g/ml. The gypsum/ettringite proportions were actually different in CON specimens, where ettringite formation seems to prevail as [[rho].sub.prec] decreased towards [[rho].sub.errringite] = 1.76 g/ml. 
		 The aggregate loss parameter [f.sub.ag*lo] indicates that ISO composition showed the highest potential to release aggregates during ESA with [f.sub.ag*lo] = 2.1. The optimization results, especially [f.sub.ag*lo] value, are in agreement with the assumption of pronounced material loss for the ISO composition that has been previously mentioned to explain the decrease of specimen radius and volume (Fig. 13). 
		 3.2.2.2. Contribution of main ESA phenomena to volume variations. The different trends of the calculated elementary volume variations (Fig. 15) depend not only on the granular skeleton but also on the cement paste volumes of the tested compositions. These two parameters impact simultaneously the estimated elementary volume variations. 
		 The CEM specimens had the highest cement paste volume. They showed the highest leaching rate (Fig. 15). However ISO, having the second highest paste volume, was the least sensitive to leaching. The coupling between the effects of paste volume and aggregates skeleton changed the relative performance of the materials. ISO was actually less affected by cracking than CEM and CON, which results in lower contact area between the aggressive solution and the cementitious matrix. Thus, even if CON composition had a lower paste volume than ISO, its leaching rate was higher than ISO because of the acceleration of diffusion induced by more severe cracking. 
		 Although the ISO composition lead to the faster aggregates loss at specimen surface, the relatively pronounced cracking of CEM and CON specimens also favored the aggregates loss for these compositions so that they reached the same aggregates loss induced volume variations. Aggregates loss was actually not only due to leaching but also to the degradation of aggregates-cement paste bonding due to cracking. Once again, couplings changed the expected classification of the volume variations. 
		 The precipitation induced volume variations showed the same trends as leaching (Fig. 15), which was confirmed by the linear correlation between leaching and precipitation volumes shown at Fig. 16. 
		 Free water volume variation could be a relevant indicator of ESA physical consequences, more precisely, the evolution of cracking during ESA. CON and CEM showed an increase in the amount of free water. This corresponds to the water uptake through the cracks. ISO showed a different behaviour, with a decrease in the amount of water. The material loss (aggregates and minerals) from the exposed surface reduced the porous volume of the ISO specimens. Similarly precipitation of minerals replaced water in porosity, thus the free water volume of ISO specimens decreased. 
		 3.2.3. Performance indicators 
		 3.2.3.1. Averaged density. The averaged density (AD) curves of CON and CEM showed the same trends (Fig. 17). These two compositions actually lead to the same degradation mechanism, but the main sulfate-rich formed mineral differ, as shown by [[rho].sub.prec] values, hence the gap between the two curves. In the case of CEM composition, [[rho].sub.prec] = 2.2 g/ml is higher than the density of precipitated minerals in the case of CON composition ([[rho].sub.prec] = 2.06 g/ml). 
		 The same explanation could be given for the observed ISO AD curve variation and the relatively high values due to the significant contribution of aggregates loss in the degradation of these specimens ([[rho].sub.aggregates] = 2.5 g/ml). 
		 3.2.3.2. Deformation path. For the same test duration (almost 180 days) the levels of longitudinal deformations differed (Fig. 18). The composition of aggregates skeleton actually influences the mechanical properties thus the behaviour of the specimens during ESA. The relatively high amount of cement paste of CEM induces higher precipitation volumes and swelling in cementitious matrix thus higher radial expansion. In the case of ISO, the pronounced aggregate loss limited the radial expansion. In the case of CON composition, coarser aggregates, well integrated into the cement paste matrix, are able to transmit swelling in the outer layer to the whole specimen. The observed behaviour lines up with [36,37] works, studying the effect of aggregate content on fracture behaviour of concrete. It was shown that increasing coarseness reduces concrete strength due to weak ITZ amplification, reduces fracture process zone and increases the fractures extension and width, which could explain the pronounced CON expansion. 
		 3.2.4. Recommendations 
		 The three studied compositions had the same NSR cement and W/C ratio. The various coarseness of aggregates resulted in different behaviors of specimens exposed to ESA. 
		 The granular skeletons influenced the buildup of stresses due to crystallisation pressure, and the mechanical properties of the materials, thus some aspects of degradation mechanism. CON composition allowed an easier detection of the precipitation of sulfate-rich minerals and the induced expansion. 
		 Thus CON could be the most relevant composition to be used to assess ESA resistance through the performance monitoring approach applied in this work. However, other criteria should be taken into account to define the composition to be used for performance tests. This will be detailed in the following part through a table gathering several criteria of performance testing. 
		 3.3. Recommended specimens 
		 In addition to ESA exposure conditions and analysis of experimental results, the geometry and composition of specimens are among the main decisions to make when designing ESA performance test. Many criteria should be taken into account. Table 7 presents some of these criteria that we found essential to validate in the specimen configuration choice. In this table '+' sign is assigned to the specimen configuration that best meets the concerned criteria. 
		 3.3.1. Selection criteria 
		 Representativeness: The best scenario to evaluate the durability of cementitious materials is to reproduce ESA on concrete specimens with (approximately) the same composition as that used on site. However, this scenario induces a significant size of the specimens, special experimental devices and long-term testing. By reducing the aggregates size, the specimen volume can be reduced keeping the ITZ aspect and its influence on species transport and mechanical properties validated. This adaptation of mix-design makes ESA tests easier to achieve in terms of time and experimental devices. 
		 Degradation kinetics influences the duration of performance tests. ESA procedure, specimen size and configuration condition the frequency of solution renewal. This is directly related to the cement paste volume of the tested specimens. The applied ESA experimental procedure consists to immerse two specimens in a 1.8 L sulfate solution. The ionic exchange cement paste/solution leads to the saturation of the solution by the leached ions. This slows down the ESA degradation and results in a longer test duration. Thus the solution renewal is necessary and its optimization requires a reduction of the cement paste volume in specimens. 
		 Detection of ettringite formation: the adopted performance monitoring approach allows estimating the leached and precipitated minerals. The configurations of tested specimens were found to influence the proportions of precipitated minerals. Non Sulfate Resisting Cement was used but some configurations did not show significant ettringite formation even by using the same ESA conditions to all the studied specimen configurations. 
		 The reduced volume of CYL specimens made with standard sand and the easiness of testing, while validating the majority of the selection criteria, have oriented our choice toward the CYL specimen configuration. 
		 4. Conclusions 
		 The mineralogical transformations of the cement paste induce significant physical evolutions of cement-based materials exposed to external sulfate attacks, such as an increase in porosity and diffusivity, cracking, and aggregates loss. The determination of these physical and chemical evolutions allows a better understanding of the degradation mechanism and a better evaluation of the tested cementitious materials performance. 
		 The performance strategy applied in this work allowed quantifying the chemical and physical variations induced by the main phenomena involved in external sulfate attacks and their contributions to overall degradation for each studied case. Through this new evaluation approach, it was possible to study ESA mechanism and highlight new experimental aspects related to the specimen configuration and its adaptation to performance tests. The two main studied parameters were the geometry of specimens and the granular skeleton. 
		 * Regardless of specimens geometries and compositions, in all studied cases, mineral precipitation was highly dependent on leaching. The volumes of precipitated minerals were proportional to the leached minerals volume. Portlandite was identified as the main leached mineral, thus it appears to be a major parameter of the ESA mechanism. Its role in the advancement of degradation deserves to be better studied. 
		 * The stability of ettringite appeared to be influenced by the granular skeleton and the geometry of the specimens, which modified the diffusion fields and the local distribution of the chemical equilibria. The results of the monitoring approach were actually found sensitive to the proportions of precipitated products. 
		 * During sulfate attack, the various tested specimens followed the same expansion path. At the beginning of the tests, the lateral expansion of the specimens prevailed. After this marked stage of absolute radius increase, the precipitation of the minerals caused an increase in stress and triggered the longitudinal expansion, generating transversal cracks. 
		 * The cylindrical geometry and the composition derived from ISO cement mortar are recommended as they were found to provide a good estimation of physical, chemical, and mechanical aspects of external sulfate attack, essentially needed for a relevant performance-based evaluation of the durability provided by given cement in sulfate-bearing environment. 
		 This study provided data and recommendations for performance testing related to cement and binder qualification. A few results are related to concrete. Further works would be needed to optimize the configuration of tests and specimens and design reliable and efficient procedures for concrete qualification when specific parameters are to be investigated. 
		 HIGHLIGHTS 
		 * Five specimen geometries and three granular skeletons were studied. 
		 * Tested specimens followed the same expansion path whatever the geometry. 
		 * Influence of specimen geometry and aggregates size on formed sulfate-rich phases. 
		 * Common correlation between leached and precipitated volume variations. 
		 * Cylindrical geometry is recommended for performance testing.

<titre>Council Discusses Cote d'Ivoire and The Democratic Republic of the Congo under Technical Assistance and Capacity Building.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jun 20, 2017 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The Human Rights Council in its midday meeting held an interactive dialogue with the Independent Expert on enhancing capacity building and technical cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the field of human rights. It then heard an oral update by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo followed by an interactive dialogue. 
		 Mohammed Ayat, Independent Expert on the enhancement of capacity building and technical cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the field of human rights, said that considerable progress had been made in Cote d'Ivoire, and the general situation in the country was on the way toward returning to normal. The most important thing was the Security Council's decision to bring an end to its mission in the country, and that the Human Rights Council had decided to bring the mandate of the Independent Expert to an end. That showed the situation had returned to normal. The decisions that the Security Council and the Human Rights Council had taken were based on certain parameters. The objective parameters were for the moment valid and relevant, but the international community needed to take care and remain vigilant in the run-up to presidential elections in 2020.
		Cote d'Ivoire, speaking as the concerned country, thanked the Independent Expert for his support in aiding the country to improve its human rights record. The Government had taken measures to improve the living standard of citizens. On strengthening the rule of law and the fight against impunity, the Government reaffirmed its willingness to shed light on all allegations of human rights violations, and to establish a transparent, independent and impartial judiciary. A project to draft a law on the protection of witnesses was under way. 
		 In the interactive dialogue that followed, delegations commended the progress made in the national reconciliation process and in improving the rule of law and the security situation, and welcomed the steps taken to fight sexual violence, including by the army. Speakers noted that the cases of mutiny since January 2017 had brought urgency to the need to implement security sector reforms and urged the Government to address the impunity for the post-electoral violence. It was of concern that the closure of the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and the simultaneous end of the mandate of the Independent Expert would reduce international support and scrutiny at a time when human rights challenges were increasing and the situation in the country remained fragile. 
		 Speaking were Tunisia on behalf of the African Group, European Union, Benin, United States, Sudan, Togo, France, Algeria, Mali, Mozambique, United Nations Children's Fund, United Kingdom, and Botswana. 
		 Also speaking were the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, and the following non-governmental organizations: International Service for Human Rights, International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, Human Rights Watch, International Catholic Child Bureau (joint statement), Espace Afrique International, Amnesty International, and Rencontre Africaine Pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme. 
		 Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in an oral update to the Council on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said the humanitarian and human rights situation had deteriorated dramatically and various actors were fuelling ethnic hatred, resulting in extremely grave, widespread and apparently planned attacks against the civilian population in the Kasais. Some 1.3 million internally displaced persons had fled. The Congolese Government had not fulfilled its obligations of protection and accountability. The Democratic Republic of the Congo could not be permitted to become a free-fire zone, where members of the security forces, armed groups and militias could kill with impunity. The High Commissioner urged the Council to deploy an independent international investigation on the human rights situation in the Kasais. 
		 Marie Ange Mushobekwa, Minister of Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, speaking as the concerned country, reiterated the will of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to continue to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and protection of human rights. She said that the undisciplined Congolese soldiers who had opened fire on civilians in several villages had been identified and brought before the courts. The Democratic Republic of the Congo deplored the barbaric murder of two United Nations experts, Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan, and two suspects had already been arrested. The international community should provide technical and logistical support to the authorities in the investigative work and in the prosecution of suspects in accordance with the criminal code in force. 
		 In the interactive debate, some delegations expressed deep concern at the violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, condemning summary executions, grave violations committed against children such as killing and recruitment, sexual violence and attacks on schools. Those speakers also roundly supported the urgent creation of an international independent investigation to improve accountability on human rights violations. The presence of mass graves was also noted with extreme concern. Other speakers praised the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the efforts it had undertaken, while urging the international community to continue providing technical assistance and capacity building. 
		 Speaking were European Union, Czechia, Greece, United States, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Sudan, Slovenia, Togo, Croatia, France, Venezuela, Egypt, Algeria, Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Netherlands, Ireland, Botswana, China, Luxembourg, Burundi and the United Kingdom, 
		 The following non-governmental organizations also spoke: Human Rights Watch, World Evangelical Alliance, International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, Espace Afrique International (joint statement), CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation, Amnesty International, International Catholic Child Bureau (joint statement) and Dominicans for Justice and Peace - Order of Preachers. 
		 The Democratic Republic of the Congo spoke in right of reply. 
		 The Council will at 3 p.m. hold its annual discussion on technical cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights, which this year is dedicated to the theme "A decade of technical cooperation and capacity building in the Human Rights Council: challenges and the way forward". 
		 Documentation 
		 The Council has before it the Report of the Independent Expert on capacity-building and technical cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the field of human rights (A/HRC/35/43). 
		 Presentation of Report by the Independent Expert on the Enhancement of Capacity Building and Technical Cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the Field of Human Rights 
		 MOHAMMED AYAT, Independent Expert on the enhancement of capacity-building and technical cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the field of human rights, said the report concerned the mission undertaken to the country. In the course of the trip, meetings had been held with authorities of the country. The United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire would come to a final conclusion soon. Another recent indication of renewed confidence was the fact that the country had been elected a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Considerable progress had been made, such as the adoption of a decree bringing to operation a law on the protection of human rights defenders. Cote d'Ivoire continued to show encouraging rates of development, at approximately eight per cent. Human development indicators needed to rise alongside macroeconomic ones. Regarding security, the general situation was on the way toward returning to normal. Everybody had to ensure that the calm dialogue with workers making wage demands continued as the Government negotiated with them. Three elections had been held, which was a major step forward. There was a dialogue, truth and reconciliation commission, and its report had finally been published. The national commission for reparation and compensation to victims had recorded the names and numbers of victims of violence and instability. 
		 Regarding justice issues, it was noted that the legal system needed time to get to the truth. Given the importance of bringing about national reconciliation, it should be given priority. Justice must be handed down in a balanced way. The National Human Rights Commission had just published its 2016 report; increased harmonization between that Commission and the Paris Principles was something that was yet to be seen. The regional committees had already been set up. In the course of Mr. Ayat's last two visits, he said it seemed to him that the most important thing was the Security Council's decision to bring an end to its mission in the country, and that the Human Rights Council had decided to bring the mandate of the Independent Expert to an end. That showed the situation had returned to normal. The decisions that the Security Council and the Human Rights Council had taken were based on certain parameters. The objective parameters were for the moment valid and relevant, but the international community needed to take care and remain vigilant in the run-up to presidential elections in 2020. 
		 Statement by the Concerned Country 
		 Cote d'Ivoire, speaking as the concerned country, thanked the Independent Expert for his support in aiding the country in improving its human rights record. The Government had taken measures to improve the living standard of citizens. As for displaced persons, an evacuation operation to infiltrate the national park Mont Peko had been launched. With respect to refugees in Burkina Faso, the Government had initiated a policy to permit the return of 270,000 out of 300,000 registered refugees. On strengthening the rule of law and the fight against impunity, the Government reaffirmed its willingness to shed light on all allegations of human rights violations, and to establish a transparent, independent and impartial judiciary. A project to draft a law on the protection of witnesses was under way. 
		 Interactive Dialogue 
		 Tunisia, speaking on behalf of the African Group, welcomed the progress made by Cote d'Ivoire, particularly in the post-conflict reconstruction and the overall political consolidation. The African Group fully supported Cote d'Ivoire's membership in the United Nations Security Council and urged the international community to continue aiding the country to strengthen the rule of law. European Union welcomed the progress made since 2011 in establishing stability, security and transitional justice in Cote d'Ivoire. It was essential that those who allegedly committed human rights violations were brought to justice. Another priority was security sector reform. Benin noted the progress made in Cote d'Ivoire in political, security and macro-economic terms, as well as in the pursuit of a dialogue between all political actors. Benin urged the international community to continue providing assistance to Cote d'Ivoire. 
		 United States recognized the progress made by Cote d'Ivoire since its peaceful 2015 elections. However, the Government had been slow to implement security sector reform and to work towards political reconciliation following the 2010-2011 post-electoral crisis. Sudan applauded the cooperation of the Government of Cote d'Ivoire with the Independent Expert, and political and legislative developments in the country. Sudan noted efforts deployed by the Government to promote and protect human rights. Togo welcomed the excellent cooperation between the Independent Expert and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire, which would help identify the country's needs in the domain of technical assistance. It noted the economic progress of the country, and the establishment of a regional human rights commission. 
		 France said that a challenge that remained was to fight impunity for the post-electoral violence and its importance for the lasting reconciliation in the country. The cases of mutiny since January 2017 had brought urgency to the need to implement security sector reforms and the international community should continue to support the authorities in the promotion and protection of human rights. Algeria commended the progress made in improving the rule of law and the security situation in Cote d'Ivoire, and especially in the area of national reconciliation and social cohesion. The international community should continue to provide support and assistance to this country. Mali welcomed the wisdom of the people of Cote d'Ivoire expressed in the elections in December 2016 and the setting up of the commission to combat sexual violence, but was concerned about the fragility of the national reconciliation process. Mali urged the Government to seek negotiated solutions with the army and the workers' unions. 
		 Mozambique commended the progress made in the reconciliation process with the support of the international community and hoped that it would continue to assist Cote d'Ivoire until it consolidated peace and security. United Nations Children's Fund was worried about violence against children in Cote d'Ivoire, noting that 17 per cent of schoolchildren were victims of rape and 73 per cent were victims of physical violence. Civil status registration remained another issue of concern, given that over 2.7 million children and youth were not registered and were thus deprived of nationality. United Kingdom welcomed the progress that the Forces Armees de Cote d'Ivoire had made in combatting sexual violence but was concerned about the fragility of the progress in the country, as demonstrated by the recent military and civil service protests. How could the international community best support Cote d'Ivoire following the departure of the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire? Botswana welcomed the considerable achievements of Cote d'Ivoire, notably national reconciliation and social cohesion, reform of defence, security and law enforcement sectors, and demobilization, disarmament and reintegration of ex-combatants. Botswana encouraged Cote d'Ivoire to remain steadfast in the protection of human rights. 
		 Network of African National Human Rights Institutions noted the improvement in the human rights situation in Cote d'Ivoire, as well as the establishment of a national human rights institution. It called for further support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Council, as well as other technical parties, to Cote d'Ivoire. International Service for Human Rights applauded the fruitful cooperation between Cote d'Ivoire and the Independent Expert, voicing hope that it would contribute to strengthening the process of national reconciliation and the fight against impunity. It voiced concern over the security of human rights defenders in areas where there were military mutinies. International Federation for Human Rights Leagues noted that Cote d'Ivoire was still facing the consequences of the 2010-2011 post-election crisis. Among those challenges, the fight against impunity, providing justice to victims, and the rule of law were the most essential. 
		 Human Rights Watch noted that there was a long-standing weakness in Cote d'Ivoire, as exemplified by military mutinies in January 2017. The inability of the Government to hold some military officers accountable for the crimes committed during the 2002-2003 conflict and during the 2010-2011 post-election crisis had contributed to an impression that the military was above the law. International Catholic Child Bureau, in a joint statement with, Company of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, and Mouvement International d'Apostolate des Milieux Sociaux Independants, stated that the Government of Cote d'Ivoire had to ensure the implementation of the National Action Plan for Legal Protection of Children and Youth. Another concern was the treatment of former child soldiers. Espace Afrique International stated that in order to manage the post-conflict situation in Cote d'Ivoire, the international community should be informed by good practices from similar situations in other countries. It called on the international community to continue supporting Cote d'Ivoire. 
		 Amnesty International welcomed the progress made in the legal protection of human rights defenders. It was concerned that the closure of the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and the simultaneous end of the mandate of the Independent Expert would reduce international support and scrutiny at a time when human rights challenges were increasing and the situation in the country remained fragile. Rencontre Africaine Pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme said that Cote d'Ivoire remained fragile because of demobilized combatants who threatened the civilian population and urged the international community to provide financial support to human rights institutions to complete their mandates, not only in the country but in the region at large. 
		 Concluding Remarks 
		 Cote d'Ivoire, speaking as the concerned country, thanked the Independent Expert, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Council for their assistance to the country. Cote d'Ivoire took note of the concerns raised in the discussion and reiterated the commitment to continue to deal with the pending issues, including those related to human rights. 
		 MOHAMMED AYAT, Independent Expert on the enhancement of capacity building and technical cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the field of human rights, concluded by saying that considerable progress had been made in Cote d'Ivoire as an overwhelming number of delegations had acknowledged in the discussion today. This included the participation of the country in the Universal Periodic Review during which it had accepted the majority of the recommendations received. Cote d'Ivoire had further presented its report to the Human Rights Committee and had positively accepted its concluding remarks. Other achievements included the abolition of the death penalty, the legislation on the protection of human rights defenders, and peaceful elections had taken place on three separate occasions, which considering where the country was coming from, was a remarkable progress. There were civil society organizations, a national human rights institution and a coordination mechanism between the military and the National Human Rights Commission, particularly in the effort to combat sexual violence. Cote d'Ivoire had been taken off the red list of countries with regard to sexual violence in conflict. 
		 The key question now was what needed to be done in light of the completion of the two mandates - that of the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and of the Independent Expert. This meant that the responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights was squarely on the shoulders of the Government. Cote d'Ivoire should continue to follow the path it had taken: develop the legislation on labour and rape and maintain the momentum on the reform and bring greater balance on the judiciary, above all. The international community should continue to aid Cote d'Ivoire, stressed the Independent Expert. Mr. Ayat thanked civil society organizations for their cooperation and support, and urged the civil society in Cote d'Ivoire to make the most from the new law on human rights defenders and make their work ever more visible. The Government and the international community should work together to put in place a focal point to coordinate the efforts to build capacity of national institutions to promote and protect human rights, and this would effectively mean that the international community would not abandon the country. 
		 INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE ON THE SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 
		 Oral Update on the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
		 ZEID RA'AD AL HUSSEIN, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, recalled that three months ago, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had reported to this Council serious concerns about the human rights violations and abuses committed by the Congolese army and police, and the Kamuina Nsapu militia in Kasai, Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental. Subsequently, when two United Nations experts were killed, the Minister for Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of the Congo called for a joint investigation to bring the perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses to justice. 
		 Since then, the humanitarian and human rights situation had deteriorated dramatically and various actors were fuelling ethnic hatred, resulting in extremely grave, widespread and apparently planned attacks against the civilian population in the Kasais. Last week, given the gravity of the allegations received and restricted access to parts of the greater Kasai area, the High Commissioner had deployed a team of Office of the Human Rights Commissioner investigators to interview recent refugees from the Kasais. Their reports were harrowing and indicated the situation in the Kasais had not only escalated but had become more complex. 
		 The High Commissioner was appalled by the creation and arming of a militia, the Buna Mura, which had carried out horrific attacks against civilians from the Luba and Lulua ethnic groups. Refugees from multiple villages in the Kamonya territory indicated that the Bana Mura had shot dead, burned to death and mutilated hundreds of villagers. In the village of Cinq, dozens of men, women and children of the Luba and Lulua communities were reportedly killed with firearms or machetes, or burnt to death on 24 April. Similar attacks appeared to have occurred in more than 20 villages in Kamonya over the past two months and numerous victims and witnesses said the militia was organized and armed by local authorities. In several villages in Kamonya, Kamuina Nsapu had allegedly carried out targeted killings, including members of the police and the army. Witnesses indicated that the Kamuina Nsapu militia comprised many children, some as young as seven, many of them under the influence of drugs. Some 1.3 million internally displaced persons had fled this landscape of horror. Over 30,000 refugees had been registered in Angola and hundreds of refugees were currently arriving every week. Forty-two mass graves had been documented by the Joint Human Rights Office in the Kasais and there might be more. 
		 High Commissioner Zeid deplored that to date, the Congolese Government had not fulfilled its obligations of protection and accountability. Progress had clearly been insufficient in view of the massive scale and horrific nature of the crimes that had taken place and, sadly, continued. The Democratic Republic of the Congo could not be permitted to become a free-fire zone, where members of the security forces, armed groups and militias could kill with impunity. Last year, of more than 5,190 human rights violations and abuses recorded, 64 per cent were committed by the Congolese army and police. The High Commissioner urged the Council to deploy an independent international investigation on the human rights situation in the Kasais. 
		 Statement by the Concerned Country 
		 MARIE ANGE MUSHOBEKWA, Minister of Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, speaking as the concerned country, reiterated the will of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to continue to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion and protection of human rights and said that the undisciplined Congolese soldiers who had opened fire on civilians in several villages had been identified and brought before the courts. The trials had started on 1 June, and were being observed by representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and human rights civil society organizations. The Democratic Republic of the Congo deplored the barbaric murder of two United Nations experts, Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan, and said that two suspects had already been arrested. At the request of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been involved in the discussions about the investigation, and the Government was open to the involvement of Swedish authorities as well. The trial of the suspects had started on 15 June and all would be done to bring to justice all those responsible for the murders of the two Experts and their Congolese colleagues. 
		 The Minister said the Central Prosecution Office had been asking the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Kananga for several weeks now to conduct a joint investigative mission. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must deal appropriately with the issue of mass graves and with the phenomenon of the Kamuina Nsapu militias. The issue of mass graves must not become a slogan by some States which in 2003 had told the entire world that Iraq had been developing weapons of mass destruction, the evidence of which had not yet been found. The international community should provide technical and logistical support to the authorities in the investigative work and in the prosecution of suspects in accordance with the criminal code in force. 
		 Interactive Dialogue 
		 European Union was deeply concerned by the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which had a negative impact on the whole region. In response to the escalation of violence in the Kasais, the European Union supported the urgent creation of an international independent investigation to improve accountability on human rights violations. Czechia expressed concerns about serious violations committed in the Kasais by both the local militias and national security forces. Czechia firmly supported the call of the High Commissioner to the Human Rights Council to establish an international investigation into human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in the Kasais, including the existence of at least 42 graves. Greece was concerned by the ongoing violence in the Kasais and its catastrophic impact on local populations. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must actively cooperate with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo MONUSCO to investigate the violations of human rights in this region. Perpetrators must be brought to justice. Greece also deplored the recruitment of children by militias. 
		 United States supported the establishment of an international independent mission to investigate human rights violations and abuses in the Kasais, including the alleged targeting of civilians, women and children by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo and militia groups. The United States also noted that uncertainty over the national government's commitment to hold elections was fuelling violence. Germany was deeply concerned by the deterioration of the human rights and humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its regional consequences. Germany outlined that compliance with United Nations Security Council resolution 2348 and the commitments made under the Political Agreement of 31 December 2016 were key to bring about transparent, peaceful and democratic elections. 
		 Switzerland was seriously concerned about the increase and worsening of violence throughout the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Noting that the Government had not taken adequate measures to address human rights violations, Switzerland urged the immediate establishment of a credible and independent international investigation into human rights violations in the Kasais region. Belgium was concerned about 40 mass graves and the displacement of more than 1.3 million civilians in the region, and supported the call to establish an independent international investigation into human rights violations. Belgium urged the full implementation of confidence building measures from the 31 December 2016 agreement, and for the registration of all voters in all regions, including the Kasais. 
		 Sudan commended the efforts of the Government to investigate the events in the Kasais and supported the efforts to reform the legislation, and the establishment of a national human rights institution pursuant to the Paris Principles. Slovenia was deeply concerned by the continued violence and human rights violations in the Kasais and elsewhere in the country, and condemned summary executions, grave violations committed against children such as killing and recruitment, sexual violence and attacks on schools, and supported the credible and transparent investigation of all reports of human rights violations. 
		 Togo expressed concern at the worsening situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in the Kasais region. The efforts of the Government to protect the civilian population were commended, and should be stepped up; the United Nations should offer logistical and material assistance to Congolese authorities. Croatia expressed concern at the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, noting that reports of human rights violations were appalling. The international community should do more for the peace process in the country. France condemned violence committed by all parties, some of which could be considered tantamount to war crimes. The authorities held the primary responsibility for human rights in the country. A robust resolution should be adopted establishing an international investigation. 
		 Venezuela said technical assistance and capacity building brought about conditions to improve the human rights situation in a country. The Democratic Republic of the Congo should be supported as it improved human rights in the country; unilateral sanctions would violate the country's rights. Egypt called on all national and international parties to help the country to protect its civilians, and expressed hope that negotiations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights would produce results. Algeria commended measures taken to bring to justice perpetrators of serious violations of human rights, and said the Democratic Republic of the Congo had shown great responsibility in conducting investigations. The international community should give the country the support it required. 
		 Portugal was gravely concerned by reports of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in the Kasais provinces. Portugal was deeply worried about the recent discovery of 42 mass graves and underlined the importance of fighting against impunity and ensuring that the perpetrators of crimes were brought to justice. Angola urged the Congolese authorities to continue their efforts to avoid a further escalation of violence that had led to the displacement of more than 1 million persons. Angola noted that it had opened its border in order to receive refugees fleeing the Democratic Republic of the Congo and called on the international community to mobilise resources to support the Congolese Government with technical cooperation to strengthen the capacities of civil servants in the field of human rights. Mozambique deplored the deterioration of the security situation in the Kasais region and voiced concerns about the executions that were carried out, including of women and children. It was important to strengthen the cooperation between the Congolese authorities and the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in Congo. 
		 Netherlands was alarmed about the reports of massive destruction of schools and the killing of women and children in the Kasais provinces. The Netherlands called on the international community to take steps to put an end to those violations of human rights and to establish an independent mechanism to investigate all human rights violations. Ireland shared the concern of the High Commissioner about the increasing violence in the Kasais. Reports on the recruitment of children by militias and the abusive use of force by national security forces were extremely worrisome. Ireland urged the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to maintain its cooperation with the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Congo. 
		 Botswana expressed deep concern at developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saying regional and international efforts should be continued with the goal of the promotion and protection of human rights. The Government's commitment to work with the Human Rights Council was encouraging. China had taken note of the report submitted and was concerned about the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The parties in question should preserve the interests of the country and the people and take the opportunity offered by the agreement to continue to resolve their differences through dialogue and negotiations. Luxembourg expressed worry about the increased violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the growing number of displaced persons. Luxembourg supported the establishment of an independent international inquiry into serious human rights violations. 
		 Burundi noted that the Congolese justice system had launched proceedings against persons suspected of having killed the two United Nations experts. The Universal Periodic Review was the best framework for constructive dialogue for the Human Rights Council to assess the human rights situation in any country. United Kingdom said the political situation pointed to a downward trajectory in the next months, with at least 42 mass graves found so far; it was vital that those events were properly investigated. Underlying much of the current tension was the failure to organize elections and the Government should allow elections to take place before the end of 2017. 
		 Remarks by the High Commissioner 
		 ZEID RA'AD AL HUSSEIN, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, outlined that, after a meeting with the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Minister of Human Rights on 5 May, an agreement had been reached on establishing a roadmap to implement an independent investigation on human rights violations in the country. This roadmap would provide the United Nations with full access to information, including on the situation of detainees and a strengthened cooperation with the Congolese authorities. Subsequently, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo had set up a task force to implement the roadmap. However, there had been no agreement on what the roadmap would include. On 24 May, an alternative roadmap was transferred by the Congolese authorities. The High Commissioner reiterated his commitment to the first roadmap. 
		 High Commissioner Zeid outlined that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was sharing information with the authorities through regular reports. The crimes committed by the Kamuina Nsapu militias had been condemned, and the cruelty of their crimes should not act as an excuse for the abuse of force by security forces. The High Commissioner underscored that it was the first time that the Office had heard that the excavations of graves had started. Some 42 mass graves still needed to be investigated so that justice could be done. On the death of the two United Nations experts, the High Commissioner outlined that the location of these crimes was known and that the United Nations was not in a position to conduct proper investigations. The High Commissioner deplored that not a single person responsible for the killings committed in December 2016 had been arrested. Several officers allegedly involved in human rights violations had been decorated which was an insult to the victims. Furthermore, investigations in security forces remained insufficient to enforce the discipline required for an army. The High Commissioner welcomed the recent signature of an agreement to fight against the use of children in armed conflicts. Finally, High Commissioner Zeid deplored that in spite of numerous requests, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had not been able to determine the needs of assistance of its population. 
		 Interactive Dialogue 
		 Human Rights Watch drew attention to the fact that hundreds and possibly thousands of people had been killed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since August 2016. Human rights teams had uncovered at least 42 mass graves, most of them believed to be the work of the Congolese army. World Evangelical Alliance supported the establishment of an international investigation on grave human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A study had shown that about 42 per cent of men and 39 per cent of women in the Nord Kivu region had been diagnosed with psychological problems due to their exposure to traumatic events. International Federation for Human Rights Leagues deplored the stagnation in the political process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Violence and human rights abuses by different armed groups had intensified in an alarming way in a number of provinces. The region of Kasais had become a theatre of unprecedented violence. 
		 Espace Afrique International, in a joint statement with, Action internationale pour la paix et le developpement dans la region des Grands Lacs, Association Dunenyo, Comite International pour le Respect et l'Application de la Charte Africaine des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples (CIRAC) and Organisation Internationale pour le Developpement Integral de la Femme, stated that the Kabila regime had no credibility since 19 December 2016. The massacres in the Kasais and other regions showed that the regime was determined to stay in power through violence. Impunity reigned in Kabila's Democratic Republic of the Congo. CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation expressed serious concern over the widespread human rights violations in the Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since August 2016. It urged the Council to launch an independent investigation into the atrocities committed there. Amnesty International noted that the human rights situation in the Kasais region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo required immediate action from the Council. More than 2,000 children had been recruited by Kamuena Nsapu, more than 600 schools had been destroyed, and 400,000 children were at risk of severe malnutrition. 
		 International Catholic Child Bureau, in a joint statement with, Company of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Mouvement International d'Apostolate des Milieux Sociaux Independants, and Pax Christi International, International Catholic Peace Movement, denounced the malfunctioning of the juvenile justice system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saying custodial sentences were being resorted to. Provisions were taken to map the justice system's provisions for children; the authorities should truly implement reforms of the justice system. Dominicans for Justice and Peace - Order of Preachers said there was generalized hunger and violence, and the growing insecurity in the Kasais regions were further destabilizing an already bad situation. The international community needed to bring pressure to bear, and establish an investigative mechanism. 
		 Right of Reply 
		 MARIE ANGE MUSHOBEKWA, Minister of Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, speaking in a right of reply, said there was no link between atrocities committed in the Kasais and the fact that legislative and presidential elections had not been held. There was no country in the world that would accept a militia starting activities and attacking State facilities. If such acts occurred in the West, they would be called acts of terrorism. The Democratic Republic of the Congo condemned all the killings in the Kasais, and reassured the Council that sanctions imposed would be commensurate with actions taken. Some police officers committed abuses in Western countries against some communities, especially in the United States. Those who were perpetrators of those crimes would be punished.

		 ABSTRACT 
		 Recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) originated from old deconstructed concrete may contain considerable amounts of heavy metals like chromium for example. In this work, we study the presence of chromium impact in the cementitious matrix of RCA, cement doped paste (OPC) and mortar with RCA (30% and 100% of RCA) from an environmental point of view. The leaching tests are carried out on monolithic and granular samples, using carbonated and non-carbonated RCA. Cr (VI) pH dependent leaching and Cr (VI) leaching mechanism have been studied. The experimental results has shown that aggregates are inert waste and can be used for road construction as substitution of original aggregates. Moreover, carbonation seems to have a positive effect on the decrease of the release of hexavalent chromium from the cementitious matrix. It was also confirmed that chromium is highly bound in the ettringite structure still present in the RCA matrix.

		 1. Introduction 
		 The valorization of construction and demolished waste (CDW) is very important nowadays due to all its economic and environmental issues [1,2]. The re-use of recycled aggregates help conserve natural resources and reduce the amount of waste disposal in landfills. One of the problems of these aggregates is that they may not be completely inert [3,4], For instance, the European directive 2003/53/CE [5] bans the use and marketing of cements with Cr (VI) higher than 2 ppm (mg/kg dry cement) starting from June 2003. Consequently, it is necessary to look onto the amount of chromium and especially the hexavalent one that might be contained in recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) from old constructions as well as its potential leachability. Indeed, this potential depends a lot on the degree of containment, the bonding into the matrix and the initial condition of the cement matrix. It should be noticed that it is much influenced by the pH of the material, of the environment and the time exposure length. For all these different reasons, heavy-metal binding mechanism studies in cement-waste mixtures have progressed since the early 1980's, starting with investigations on cement-stabilized wastes, cements and mortars containing elevated heavy metal concentrations [6,7], Several researchers [1,4,8,9], have showed that each ion has its own geochemical properties, which makes the binding mechanism differ from a heavy metal to another. It can be generalized that cations either precipitate as hydroxides and/or get absorbed to cement hydration minerals, especially to CSH, due to their high concentration of surface sites [7], 
		 A hydrated Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) consists mainly of calcium silicate hydrates (CSH), portlandite, ettringite and AFmphases. These minerals make up about 90-wt% in a hydrated OPC cement paste [10], Investigations carried out by [8,11] led to that the Cr (VI) immobilization takes place by one or a combination of the following mechanisms: addition (Cr-CSH), substitution (Cr-ettringite, monochrome-aluminate) or precipitation of new compounds (calcium chromate, Na-Cr-Aft). 
		 Many authors have reported the presence of chromium in the ettringite replaced by the sulfate. Thermodynamic models of pH dependent leaching tests on powdered samples include solid solution of ettringite and chromate ettringite. Indeed, it is generally accepted that the hydration product ettringite is a potential candidate for the incorporation of Cr[O.sub.4] [12-15]. The identical charge and radii of S04 and Cr[O.sub.4] ions suggest that chromate should readily substitute in the crystal structure of ettringite with solid solutions formation [13], The rate investigations on the Cr[O.sub.4]/S[O.sub.4-] ettringite solid solution series have focused on solid composition analysis under different synthesis conditions, concluding that crystal morphology is dependent on the synthesis method. In addition to ettringite (Aft-phase), AFm-phases may play an important role on Cr[O.sub.4] binding mechanisms in the cement matrix [12,14,16], AFm phases are based on a layered structure with alternating main layers composed of [[[Ca.sub.2]Al[(OH).sub.6]].sup.+] and inter layers where water molecules and anions balance the charge [14], Monosulphate contains one mole sulfate and a variable amount of water in the interlayer; with a general formula 3CaO [Al.sub.2][O.sub.3] CaS[O.sub.4] n[H.sub.2]0 n = 16, 14, 12, 10.5, 10.9 and 6) [12,14], Next to fully substituted Aft and AFm-phases, solid solution formation is commonly observed [7]. 
		 Hence, within the framework of these previous investigations, the objectives of the present work are to study the leachability potential of chromium, specifically hexavalent chromium, from the recycled aggregates containing a considerable amount of total chromium, and its probable binding in the cementitious matrix of the recycled aggregates, originated from old demolished concrete. Coupled to this later objective, we aim to compare the behavior of the RCA carbonated and non-carbonated when incorporated in a cementitious matrix (mortar or concrete) at determined percentages. The choice of the assessment of leaching behavior of hexavalent chromium is due to the data lack on the carbonation effect on its release and its behavior in a cement matrix and also by a manifested interest of EFB (French Concrete School). 
		 2. Materials and methods 
		 2.1. Materials 
		 For the experimental study, we have used recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), originated from two different sites, from around the 70's, that we will note both, 1972 (year of construction of the 1st site), QI (Quai d'lvry as the origin of the 2nd site). Both sites are old, and potentially containing important amount of chromium. The natural sand used in this study is from Boulonnais career. It has granular sizes fraction of 0-4 mm. Table 1 summarizes chemical composition of both sites and natural sand. In addition, Fig. 1 shows granular distribution of both sites and natural sand used in mortar. 
		 The cement used is a CEM I 52.5N CP2, containing 95% clinker and 5% additives (gypsum, iron sulfate, limestone filler). 
		 2.2. Methods 
		 2.2.1. Sample preparation 
		 The samples batches obtained from the recycling plant were reduced into appropriate laboratory samples following EN 932-1 [17] and EN 15002 [18] standards which specify the methods of splitting and size reduction procedure. The particles size reduction was realized using a jaw crusher (Retsch). Following this step, the samples were prepared by sieving the crushed material into the granular sizes fraction: 0-4 mm. The crushing of a part of the samples to obtain granular sizes less than 1 mm was conducted prior to the conformity leaching test, and to the determination of the natural pH as well as physical characterizations. After preparing the RCA, we sorted the non-carbonated ones from the carbonated, using the visual carbonation front determination, the phenolphthalein solution. This indicator turns into purple color when the pH is higher than 9. It was obvious that mostly the RCA were non-carbonated, so we proceeded to an accelerated carbonation at 20% of C02 for around 5 days. The visual indicator was used to make sure that all the samples were carbonated. After preparing the RCA, the mortars were made using the normalized formula. The water adsorption coefficient of both RCA was calculated and taken into account in the water content of the mortars. All the mortar samples were prepared with a cement /water ratio of 0.5 and all were cast in polypropylene mold of 4x4x16 cm. The substitution of RCA to natural aggregates was at 30% and 100% of total mass in mortar. In this paper, we present results for mortars prepared with RCA from both sites, non-carbonated and carbonated aggregates, with the defined substitution percentage. The samples were noted as followed: MRSR% NC_Site or MRSR% C_Site (MR = mortar, % = % of substitution as aggregate, NC = non-carbonated RCA, C = carbonated RCA). The different quantities used for the mortars preparation are summarized in Table 2. The curing period for mortar and cement paste was of 28 days in climate chamber (20[degrees], 100% relative humidity). 
		 The total amount of the different elements (minor and trace) are determined with fluorescence x-ray analyses S2 from Bruker and ICP OES (Varian Vista-MPX). 
		 2.2.2. Acid neutralization capacity according to EN 15864 
		 In order to establish the probable influence of the carbonation rate on the release of hexavalent chromium from the cementitious matrix of the RCA, we used the acid neutralization capacity test following the standard XP EN 15864. The samples were reduced to 1 mm diameter, and then a ratio of L/S = 9 [19] was used for the starting test. An acid solution, HC1 0.1 M to 5 M, was used to reach the desired pH solution. The duration of the test is 48 h, divided into three stages, where the pH of the solution is controlled at each step: 4 h, 44 h and 48 h. If the difference of the pH is greater than 1.5 pH, the test should be repeated. The titration curve is obtained when we have the variation of the pH in function of the amount of the acid solution added at each pH reached. Once we have the titration curve, the acid neutralization capacity test can be carried out, as we can control the pH of the solution by adding the exact amount of solid solution determined with the titration curve. After each step, the leachate was collected, and the concentration of Cr (VI) was established, in order to determine the behavior of Cr (VI) towards leaching in different pH conditions. This test can simulate the dropping of pH, during carbonation, when it is around 8-9 pH. The results obtained after the test, should give us an idea about the Cr (VI) behavior when present in different cementitious matrix and when exposed to different leaching conditions. 
		 2.2.3. Continuous leaching tests 
		 2.2.3.1. Basic characterization. EA NEN, 2004, "Tank leaching test" is a dynamic test for assessing diffusion-controlled leaching and is commonly used to asses leaching characteristics of metals from porous granular molded samples and monolith specimens [20], The purpose of this laboratory test is to simulate the diffusion controlled leaching of inorganic components from granular building waste materials, as a function of time and over a period of 64 days. For the granular molded diffusion-controlled test, the test sample is compacted in a cylindrical vessel and then exposed in one side to a leaching fluid (natural pH, demineralized water) (see Fig. 2 leaching tests). The tested materials should be crushed into granular materials of a granular size distribution of 0-4 mm. It is necessary that the maximum granular size (95%) must be of 4 mm. 
		 Triplicate monolithic and granular specimens were prepared. The samples were immersed in the vessels for leaching experiments after 28 days of cure. The leaching fluid is refreshed at set times. The leachant was renewed at eight specific times (0.25, 1, 2.25, 4, 9, 16, 36 and 64 days) [21]. An aliquot of leachate was filtered through a 0.45 |im cellulose nitrate membrane filters and was stored at 4 [degrees]C. The leachate pH, EC, Total Cr and Cr (VI) were measured (ICP, FRX...). 
		 The mean interval flux (Fj, mg/[m.sup.2]/s) and cumulative mass release (Ey, mg/[m.sup.2]) were calculated according to the following Eqs. (1) and (2) [21,22]: 
		 [F.sub.j] = [C.sub.j] * [V.sub.j]/[A.sub.s] * ([t.sub.j] = [t.sub.j-1]) (1) 
		 [E.sub.] = [j.summation over (i=1)] ([C.sub.j] x [V.sub.j]/[A.sub.s]) (2) 
		 where [F.sub.j] is the mean interval flux over test fraction (mg/[m.sup.2]/s), [C.sub.j] the eluate concentration in test fraction j (mg/L), Vj the volume of eluate collected in test fraction j (L), [A.sub.s] the surface area of monolith specimen exposed to eluent ([m.sup.2]), [t.sub.j] the cumulative time at end of test fraction j(s) and [t.sub.j-1] the cumulative time at end of test fraction j - 1 (s). 
		 The two prominent metrics used in the interpretation of the leaching tests results, in order to assess the leaching mechanisms, are: 1) the plots of cumulative mass release vs time; 2) their loglog versions. The slope of the linear curve, of the log-log plots is used to determine the leaching mechanism [1,22,23]: 1) diffusion-controlled release if s = 0.5 [+ or -]0.1; (2) matrix dissolution s  0.8; and 3) initial surface wash-off s  0.4. 
		 2.2.3.2. Conformity test EN 12457-2. Conformity leaching tests were realized according to the NF EN 12457-2 [24] for granular materials of 0-4 mm without any inclusions. It is a shaking test (round) with an L/S = 10 for 90 g of material during 24 h, with a leaching solution of demineralized water. The leaching test is carried out on all the granular materials used in the study. For this experiment, we also use a 0-4 mm natural sand as a reference material. In order to compare the results to the values of the maximum guidelines expressed in mg/kg, the concentration obtained after analysis in mg/L is converted as follows in Eq. (3) [1]: 
		 C(mg/kg) = C(mg/L) x Volume(L)/sample dry weight(kg) (3) 
		 2.2.4. Analytical method 
		 2.2.4.1. Quantification of heavy metal: spectroscopy UV-visible. The quantification of the hexavalent chromium content was adapted from the method presented in the French standard EN 196-10 [25], to determine the Cr (VI) content in cement mortars after leaching tests. 
		 After leaching tests, the aliquot obtained after 0.45 urn filtration and storage at 4 [degrees]C was analyzed in order to determine the concentration of hexavalent chromium using the UV visible spectroscopy analysis. 
		 2.3. Equipment 
		 The chromium concentration measurements were performed on a spectroscopy system using a Schimadzu Spectroscopy 2600 UV. The chromium species spectra were recorded from a wavelength of 300-900 nm. The hexavalent chromium forms a colorful reagent with the 1.5-Diphenlycarbazide (DPC), which is generally detected at 540 nm. 
		 2.4. Reagents, standards and samples 
		 All solutions were prepared with analytical grade reagents and ultra-pure water, obtained from a purification system Thermofisher. The glassware vessels were soaked in HN[O.sub.3] for 24 h, rinsed thoroughly with distilled water, and finally rinsed for the last time with ultra-pure water. Standard soak solutions containing 1000 mg/L [Cr.sup.VI] as [K.sub.2][Cr.sub.2] [O.sub.7] (potassium dichromate) were used. Intermediate low concentrations were prepared by dilution of the corresponding stock solution with water, to obtain a solution of 50mg/l [Cr.sup.VI]. Hydrochloric acid, acetone were supplied from VWR. A DPC solution was prepared as well, by dissolving 250 mg of the reagent in 50 mL of acetone. 
		 2.5. Procedure 
		 A simple aliquot, obtained after the leaching test, was filtered through a 0.45 |im membrane. The filtrate was then transferred to a 100 mL Erlen Meyer flask. The procedure consists on transferring 40 mL of the filtrate into a 50 mL flask, add an amount of hydrochloric acid HC11 mol/L to obtain a pH between 2.1 and 2.5 and add at the same moment 1.5 Diphenylcarbazide indicator solution. The solution was then put on rest for about 10 min, and not more than 30 min, to allow the full development of the color. Then, it was pumped to the 62-|iL cuvette for spectrophotometry analysis. Blank and mixed standard solutions have the same treatment. The mixed standard solutions used in the analytical work are: 0.005 mg/L, 0.01 mg/1, 0.05 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L, 0.20 mg/L and 0.30 mg/L. 
		 2.5.1. Solid characterization 
		 The investigations to characterize the materials were mainly realized with XRD analysis. Equipment used for this analysis is Bruker D2 phaser diffractometer with a continuous scanning mode and Cu Ka radiation ([lambda] = 1.5406 [for all]). The lines were measured in the 20 range (5-69)[degrees] by an increment of 0.002[degrees] for each 0.1 s. The software used for building the X-ray diffraction patterns is DIFFRAC. EVA with 1CDD PDF2 and Jade software for fitting. The samples used for this characterization are the cement paste (OPC), the spiked cement paste (OPC doped) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). 
		 3. Results and discussions 
		 3.1. Leaching test 
		 The mechanisms that control the time dependent leaching of the cementitious materials (in both cases monolithic or granular molded) are mainly [15]: 
		 --Diffusion of ions in the pore system of the cementitious matrix 
		 --Solubility 
		 --Wash-off of soluble salts at the surface of the sample 
		 The diffusion tests realized on both cases, monolithic and granular samples, using carbonated and non-carbonated recycled aggregates, are interpreted using the prediction model of longterm cumulative release, plotting the cumulative release versus the time. For each test, we choose to present the results obtained for the first site, and then the second one. The results presented here aim to (i) compare the different behavior toward leaching of the different matrix obtained by substitution of natural aggregates with RCA in new materials (ii) determine the behavior of the chromium hexavalent when leached (iii) determine the influence of carbonation on leaching behavior of chromium hexavalent in the new cementitious matrix. 
		 3.1.1. pH dependent leaching 
		 3.1.1.1. The acid neutralization capacity. The acid neutralization capacity curves, obtained for recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) non-carbonated and carbonated, are plotted in Fig. 3. These curves present information on the amount of acid required to neutralize a certain alkalinity and to decrease pH to a particular final value. The pH and the ability of a solidified product to neutralize acid are important at every leaching study [26], Where, not only the solubility of the contaminant is often pH-dependent [1,23,27] but also the physical matrix is dissolved and can be weakened by the acid attack. In addition, the dissolved hydrates can be of interest in the research and the leaching modelling [26]. 
		 For the non-carbonated recycled aggregates, the acid titration curve exhibits a decrease in pH from the neutral pH of 12.12 to pH 10 over a range of 0.9 mol of H+ per kg of dry material. After this point, the curve changes into a steeper decrease until dropping to a pH around 5 after adding more than 5 mol of [H.sup.+] per kg of dry material. In the contrary, the titration curve of the carbonated RCA has a rapid drop from pH 11 to 7.5 after adding only 0.7 mol of [H.sup.+] per kg of dry material. This rapid decrease is then followed by a small plateau around pH 7 [approximately equal to] 6.5 due to the buffering capacity resulting from carbonate calcium dissolution. The cementitious matrix, after carbonation, loses of its alkalinity, which is translated clearly in the titration curve associated with matrix neutralization. The loss of alkalinity associated to the carbonation was in consistency with the titration curve obtained as reported by different researchers in the literature [22,28], The comparison between these behaviors will help us interpreting the chromium leaching behavior under different conditions: at carbonated and non-carbonated atmosphere. 
		 Garrabrants et al. [22] carried out investigations on the porewater solution changes during carbonation using Portland cement mortars as samples. The effects of carbonation were studied through two behaviors (i) material buffering capacity and (ii) constituent equilibrium as a function of leachate pH. The study focused on the chemical alteration of Portland cement matrix after a period of storage in an unsaturated environment during drying, carbonation or precipitation within the pore structure. The pore water characteristics and changes will determine the influence of the matrix constituent chemistry on mass transport from a monolithic form of the cement-based waste; the leaching of some heavy metals was then studied such as Arsenic, Lead, Cadmium and Copper. The researchers [22] reported, for the carbonated matrix, a decrease in the pore water composition of several species, compared with the carbonated one, such as sodium and potassium by 30% and 70% respectively. In addition, the concentration of calcium was increased by a factor of 400 for the same matrix. The changes of pore water chemistry may influence greatly the release of the trace metals. For example, it was observed that the solubility of Lead and Copper was lower in alkaline regions (pH  9) for the carbonated samples. 
		 3.1.1.2. Chromium pH-dependent leaching. In order to carry out the test, the titration curves presented earlier helped us determine the different quantities of acid solution to reach different values of pH for the leaching tests, from pH 12 to around 4. The Cr (VI) concentration versus pH dependent leaching of hexavalent chromium is shown in Fig. 4. The study has been investigated for both samples: non-carbonated and carbonated and the same trend is mainly obtained. The leaching of Cr (VI) can be studied as followed where the behavior can be divided into three different sectors: 
		 In the first sector (4  pH  10.1), we can observe a plateau and almost a constant leachate rate, precisely for the carbonated aggregates. At a pH  10, the decalcification of the cementitious matrix is observed, especially the C-S-H gel, so it may means that this latter is not the only one responsible for chromium binding. The C-S-H gel are likely to dissolve at a pH around 10, as reported by many researchers [26,29] related to increase in the silicon concentration in the leachate pH. The little changes in the chromium concentration may indicates the small binding in the gel C-S-H. It was also reported by Stegemann et al. [26], that not only the Cr (III) has no influence on the ANC of cement pastes but also can be taken up into the structure of C-S-H acting as an accelerator. 
		 From the pH range of 10.2-11.8, we have the most important leachate values of a maximum leaching 0.2 mg/L. This may indicates that the leaching of some hydrates is responsible for the Cr (VI) leaching as well and so for the retention of this element. In addition, it is indicating the binding to sulpho-aluminate calcium hydroxide phases (e.g. Ettringite). 
		 In the last part, for pH  11.8, the rates of Cr (VI) leaching have their lowest values probably due to the stabilization of the phases in which they are retained. 
		 Generally, the most stable forms of chromium, (III) and (VI). are found in the leachate with a predominant presence of the hexavalent form for around 80% [30], This behavior is highly correlated with the solubilities of these species: Cr (VI) has a higher solubility compared to the Cr (III) [16,30,31], Zhang et al. [29], in their study concerning the presence of Cr (VI) in cement pastes with and without calcium sulfate, confirmed that the leaching of Cr in alkaline pH is mostly controlled by Cr substitution as a solid solution in ettringite. XRD characterizations of the leaching residues after the experiments, confirmed the presence of Cr[O.sub.4]-ettrignite increasing with decreasing pH to 11.8. Below this value, the Cr[O.sub.4]-ettringite seems to dissolve completely and to be responsible for the high increase in Cr (VI) found in the leachate between pH 10.5 and 11.8. Due to the decomposition of Cr-ettringite, they also detected brownmillerite-like phase at a range of pH between 10.5 and 10.8. 
		 As reported earlier, the C-S-H can be as well responsible for the Cr retention. At pH 9.8 the remaining Cr may be binded in the C-SH or precipitated at scarcely Cr (III) which is not toxic. At acid pH, most of the phases disappear and there is a constant release of chromium, mostly in its (III) form as crocoite PbCr[O.sub.4] [32], 
		 These findings are in great agreement with the results of the ANC curves, where the most leaching sector is observed for pH values between 10.5 and 11.8, which corresponds to the dissolution of secondary Cr-ettringite. 
		 Overall, the fractions of heavy metal leached from the mortars samples monoliths and granular matrix were much lower than the total concentrations, suggesting that the solubility and mobility were governed by matrix mineralogy and pH-dependent stabilization process [32], As reported earlier, the samples containing non-carbonated aggregates exhibits the most important values obtained after leaching. 
		 3.1.2. Cr (VI) leaching mechanism 
		 3.1.2.1. Leaching of calcium. The study of the alkalis release from the pore solution, more specifically the calcium, is made in order to confirm the suitability of both leaching tests, molded granular and monolithic materials, for our case study. In the literature, it is confirmed that for cementitious materials, it is the diffusion mechanism that controls the leaching of calcium [33]. 
		 In the first place, the feasibility for the molded granular materials is discussed. The leaching mechanism is discussed as described in the NEN 7347 [34]. The cumulative plot (log-log) of calcium as a function of time is used to determine the likely mechanism. Strong linear log-log plots of cumulative Ca concentration versus time, in Fig. 5(a), ([R.sup.2] = 0.94-0.99) with slopes of 0.42 to 0.50 ([+ or -] 0.05) point to diffusion-controlled leaching. Linear relationships between cumulative release Ca versus time or square root of time evident in the first 14 days, with a distinct break, suggesting a steady release confirming that the leaching was controlled by diffusion [22]. A dissolution or a delayed diffusion maybe observed for some of the samples at the starting of the test, which is mainly due to the short time of the leaching test and the decrease in the release. It is very important to notice that the concentrations depend on the duration of each elution step and the continuous decrease in the release of the different elements at the surface [32]. Mostly, the concentration of the Ca in the second step are below the first one because the duration is shorter, but the concentrations at the subsequent steps tend to increase because we have longer leaching periods combined with a less abrupt decrease in release rate. 
		 In Fig. 5(b), the cumulative release of calcium vs leachate pH are plotted. The steady increase in Ca release towards lower pH is mainly due to portlandite dissolution followed by the decalcification of CSH [32,35]. The alkalis are largely present in the pore solution and due to their weak bonding to C-S-H, they are able to enter the pore solution rapidly [32], 
		 In the literature, different studies focused on the leaching of calcium from the cementitious matrix of versatile samples, for example, Berger &amp;al [36] investigated the leaching of calcium sulfoaluminate at regulated pH of 7 and temperature of 20 [degrees]C from cement pastes. It was found that the calcium ions, as well the sulfate releases, increased linearly versus the square root of time, which corresponded to a diffusion leaching mechanism. 
		 The same interpretation was made for the results obtained for the monolithic samples, after semi-dynamic tank leaching tests NEN 7345. We present the results obtained for the mortars prepared with the RCA of the 1st site: MRSR_1972 in Fig. 6. The diffusion leaching mechanism is the predominant one, as the slope of the curves for the cumulative arithmetical release (mg/[m.sup.2]) versus the cumulative leaching time have a correlation ratio [R.sup.2] between 0.93 and 0.97. 
		 3.1.2.2. Leaching of hexavalent chromium. The leaching mechanisms of hexavalent chromium was studied after confirming the suitability of the basic characterization tests with our samples. Most of the literature found focused on the leaching behavior from cement pastes, cement mortars and different alternative materials. 
		 The results for the molded granular experiments, NEN 7347, are presented first. 
		 In the Fig. 7(a) and (b), the cumulative release of Cr (VI) and the mean interval Cr (VI) flux are presented as a function of cumulative leaching time. The Cr (VI) mass interval fluxes through the exposed surface area for all the studied samples exhibits an inverse linear relationship to leaching time (Fig. 7a). The observed relationships are also consistent with the notion that, in diffusion-controlled mass transport, interval flux is inversely related to square root of time, while cumulative release varies linearly with the square root of time [1,31,32]. The mean interval flux for Cr (VI) is very low (0.001 mg/[m.sup.2]/s) and there is no difference between results obtained for all the samples in the study. In the contrary, a positive linear relationship is observed between the Cr (VI) cumulative release and the cumulative leaching time for all the samples as well (Fig. 7b). The gradient of a log-log plot of cumulative leaching vs time indicates the predominant leaching mechanism. If the gradient is less than 0.35 then it can be a surface wash-off mechanism. If the slope is between 0.35 and 0.65 then it can be assumed that it is the diffusion mechanism, if not then it is a depletion. Strong linear relationships ([R.sup.2] = 0.80-0.86) with averages slopes of 0.46 to 0.57 ([+ or -]0.09) between the cumulative release versus time point to a diffusion-controlled mechanism for most of the studied samples. The matrix dissolution may require a more important leaching period (64 days). The cumulative Cr (VI) is still very low for all the samples; which is consistent with the results presented further. 
		 Metrics parameters are used for the interpretation of the results, such as conductivity and the leachate pH as they can give important information regarding the leaching behavior of the matrix. The data are plotted in the Fig. 8(a), (b). We can observe that the trend pH is situated between 11.2 and 12.4 and most of the samples exhibits the same behavior regarding the Cr (VI) leaching. Moderate relationships are also observed between the Cr (VI) cumulative concentration and the conductivity. In a less frequent application, those metrics outlined with the cumulative release can be used for the interpretation. Beard [23] has reported for example a relationship between Cu and conductivity suggesting a diffusion leaching in cement-based materials as a pore-initiated one and declining the surface wash-off or the matrix dissolution as it is not evident. The pH of the leachate (Fig. 8b) varied mainly between 11.2 and 12.5. The increase in the leachate pH is mainly due to the decalcification of the cement matrix. Moreover, we can observe that the leaching of the hexavalent chromium increase after a pH of 11.5 and decrease after an increase of the pH to around 12.5. This result correlate strongly with the one founded earlier. The leaching of the Cr (VI) is more important in a pH range of 11.8 to 12.3. 
		 Second, for the contaminant release from monoliths samples, almost the same observation are made, indicating the high acid neutralization capacity of the samples as the pH and the Electric Conductivity (EC) are considerably high for all the samples. 
		 The interpretation of the results obtained for the monolith semi-dynamic leaching test are based on the one of the EN NEN 7345 [37[. The results for the samples MRSR_1972 are presented here. 
		 Cumulative, (log-log) plots of leaching Cr (VI) as a function of time as well as the fitting of lines with a slope of 0.5 were used to determine the likely leaching mechanism (Fig. 9). 
		 The comparison between data obtained after both leaching tests, for the different forms of the samples granular and monolithic, led us to conclude that regardless of the aggregate form, percentage and origin, the leaching of Cr (VI) is mostly at the same levels. Somehow, at some level, we can observe that the release of the heavy metal from the samples prepared with noncarbonated recycled aggregates is more important reaching [approximately equal to] 0.030 mg/kg for the sample prepared with 100% substitution with non-carbonated aggregates, as observed in Fig. 10. 
		 Regarding the results obtained in both leaching tests, the release of the heavy metal from the cementitious matrix of new materials can be negligible from an environmental point of view. Still studying its mechanism is very important in order to assess the behavior of its leaching, in order to establish the influence on the release of different parameters such as the origin of the aggregates, the carbonation rate of the materials or the surface exposure. 
		 A difference is however observed between the results obtained with monolith samples and granular one, which suggests an influence of the surface exposed to the leaching test. 
		 a) Exposure Surface influence 
		 The comparison between the data obtained of the Cr (VI) cumulative leaching, for both sites, using recycled aggregates as 100% substitution and both semi-dynamic leaching tests, is plotted in the Fig. 11. 
		 The difference between the results obtained when using the granular diffusion test and the monolithic one is remarkable. As it can be observed, higher amounts of leachate Cr (VI) are obtained especially for the second site used for the recycled aggregates. The negligible leaching of the heavy metal from the monoliths can be mainly attributed to two mechanisms: (i) the slow diffusion due to the tortuous path between the solid and the liquid phase; (ii) a pH-dependent stabilization due to the alkaline environment conditions. As also the diffusion-controlled leaching mechanism decreases with the thickness of the material [1]. 
		 The variation of the forms in both tests may influence the results as (i) the surface exposed to the leachate is more important in the case of the granular materials, (ii) the grinding operation of the mortars may also expose more important cement surface where Cr is binded, (iii) the thickness of the material is more important for the monolith samples and (iv) the L/S ratio is not exactly 10 for the granular tests as there are important water losses in each tank leaching step. 
		 In a study comparing the percolation and batch leaching tests data by Guyonnet [38], the experimental tests conducted by Grathwol &amp; al [38], indicated that the leaching behavior of solid waste was independent of duration and physical dimensions of the leaching tests if the dilution is negligible under equilibrium conditions. 
		 3.2. Structure characterization 
		 In order to establish the relation between the reported hydrated phase and the low rate of leached Cr (VI) in our leachate samples, DRX characterization of the RCA are made. 
		 In Fig. 12 X-ray diffraction pattern analysis for the different samples OPC Ref, OPC_ Doped and RCA are given. The most prominent peaks in the hydrated Portland cement are those of ettringite family structure around 2[THETA]] values of 9[degrees], 16[degrees], 19[degrees], 23[degrees] and 29[degrees]. When considering the diffraction pattern of the OPC Doped, we found almost the same peaks but with a slight displacement. For the Miller indices (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (1 0 4), (1 1 4) and (1 1 6), the peaks are detected at 2 [[THETA]] values of 9.158[degrees], 15.848[degrees], 18.926[degrees], 22.962[degrees], 29.669[degrees] (#PDF033-0248 and #PDF041-1451) which corresponds respectively to two peaks of what is identified as Bentorite and the rest is ettringite as shown in Table 3. 
		 The same analysis was applied for the last diffraction pattern obtained for the RCA and almost the same peaks appeared with some differences. For example, a peak was observed for the plans (2 0 0) for a 2 [[THETA]] value of 17.9756[degrees]. The structure observed was mostly like the ettringite but with a general formula (3CaO X [Al.sub.2][O.sub.3]-*3CaCr[O.sub.4]-32[H.sub.2]0). Afterwards, a fitting procedure was carried out in order to calculate the d-spacing, the lattice parameters and volume cells of each structure to compare the values obtained after the fitting with the one of the PDF files. Indeed, the d-spacings, from the obtained XRD patterns, of ettringite, bentorite and Crettringite are calculated after a fitting process using the JADE software, and then a comparison with the d-spacings listed in the equivalent ICDD for each structure was made. Five peaks of the 24 peaks measured between 8[degrees] and 70[degrees] 2 [C] were under meticulous investigations for each obtained diffraction pattern. In the Table 4, the different values obtained after the fitting in comparison with the one of the PDF files are presented. It is observed that the values were very close and only a slight difference is appreciated. The cell dimensions were calculated using the Eq. (4) for hexagonal system minerals. 
		 [mathematical expression not reproducible] (4) 
		 The calculated unit cell dimensions for the obtained ettringite structure are [a.sub.0] = 11.106 [+ or -] 0.008 [Angstrom] and [c.sub.0] = 22.866 [+ or -] 0.009 [Angstrom]. These dimensions were very close to those reported on the ICDD #041-1451 card ([a.sub.0] = 11.224 [Angstrom] and [c.sub.0] = 21,408 [Angstrom]). In Fig. 13, for example, we can see a focus on a peak 9 position, at 15.893[degrees] for Ettringite and 15.909[degrees] for Bentorite. The calculated unit cell dimensions for the bentorite after the fitting are [a.sub.0] = 11.0804 [+ or -] 0.006 [Angstrom] and [c.sub.0] = 21.7238 [+ or -] 0.009 [Angstrom] which were comparable to the values of the PDF card #033-028; [a.sub.0] = 11.21 [Angstrom] and [c.sub.0] = 21.48 [Angstrom]. The very close matrix parameters (hexagonal, comparable unit cell volume) have made the difference difficult to appreciate and a sharp look on the pattern is the clue to make that difference. The same calculations of the lattice characteristics were done and the obtained unit cell dimensions are comparable to the one of the ICDD PDF file of the Bentorite (#033-0218). The slight difference between the two structures can be due to the substitution of the Cr (III) by the A! (Ill) in the AFm phase. Indeed, the incorporation into mineral phases has become the relevant binding mechanism of chromium in the cementitious matrix, which is a much asserted result in the literature review [6,13,15,39], AFm and AFt minerals can be having a high anion immobilization since they are formed from a wide range of starting materials. Ettringite, a hydrate phase of Portland cement, known as an alumino-ferrite tri phase, form hexagonal prismatic or acicular crystals. It consists of a layered crystal structure built by periodical stacking of positively charged [{[Ca.sub.2][Al [(OH).sub.6]]2 24[H.sub.2]0}.sup.6+] called columns and negatively charged interlayers consisting of anions and water molecules called channels {(S[O.sub.4]) 3-2H20}-6 [12,40], 
		 Several substituted ettringite phases have been synthesized for a variety of anions (e.g. Cr[O.sub.4], Se[O.sub.4], C[O.sub.3], [B.sub.2][O.sub.3]) and aluminum is successful substituted by Fe or Cr [12,14,41], The ettringite structure is known to be a very "forgiving" one as it can be a subject of deviations in composition without a change in its structure [40]. The ionic substitution is one of the main forms of the compositional change that can occurs at the crystal chemical level which is definitely the case of the Bentorite structure where a substitution between an Al (III) and a Cr (III) cations is observed. All the crystal chemical substitutions in this very specific mineral occur at the aluminum and sulfate level. The size range for Al (III) is between 0.42 [Angstrom] and 0.76 [Angstrom] [12,23], The unit cell volumes of both structures is very near due to the close radii of Al(lII) and Cr(III) (0.755 [Angstrom]). In the case of Cr-ettringite structure, the size of the Cr[O.sup.2-.sub.4] (distances Cr-0 is around 1.69 [Angstrom]) anion is larger than that of the (S[O.sup.2-.sub.4] distances from 1.42 to 1.46 [Angstrom]) [23] but the main difference remains in the position of the anion. The complexity of this structure is still under investigations and it can be assumed that the obtained difference of the peaks is due to the position of the chromate in the ettringite structure. In the diffraction pattern of the RCA sample, Cr-ettringite is observed for the plan (2 0 0) where there is no Ettringite detected (expected due to the age of the sample), and it has a d-spacing of 4.9344 A which is close to 4.8590 [Angstrom] of the ettringite cited in the PDF File #041-1451 but not found in any pattern described below. The cell parameters for the Cr-ettringite structure calculated after the fitting are [a.sub.0] = 11.417 [+ or -] 0.006 [Angstrom] and [c.sub.0] = 21.538 [+ or -] 0.008 [Angstrom], also close to the values of the PDF card #041-0218 ([a.sub.0]= 11.394 and [c.sub.0] = 21.47). The similitudes but also the differences led to the complexity of the matter; but it has been proved that aged recycled concrete aggregates containing chromium could be observed and are considered inert wastes since there is no leaching, or very weak detectable leaching, of this heavy metal in the environment. The last observations led us to conclude that the chromium, in its trivalent or hexavalent form, could be stabilized in the cement matrix over time. The low amount of chromium and its retention in the cement matrix can explain the low amounts found in the leachate after leaching tests. 
		 3.3. RCA containing Cr (VI) as a waste or a new construction product 
		 After determine the different leaching mechanism, the leachate concentration of the parameters of environmental concern, especially hexavalent chromium, according to the EU directive for use in road constructions is determined, where criteria for wastes intended for landfill of a specific type (inert, non-hazardous, hazardous) are given. 
		 In Table 4, the different limit values for the classification of wastes according to the Directive 2003/33/CE [5] for a ratio L/S of 10 are summarized. The limits defined by French directives for road construction [42], road type 3 for both conformity tests NF EN 12457-2 and the NF EN 12457-4, defined at total Cr = 0.6 mg/kg is considered. 
		 For the different samples used in the study, an average of the leachate hexavalent chromium is calculated and it is observed that all the samples (Fig. 14) are under both limits for wastes and for road construction. The samples will not have any consequences if used in road construction, and if dropped as wastes in landfills they are under the limit for category waste as inert. 
		 4. Conclusions 
		 Understanding the leaching of hexavalent chromium from old recycled concrete aggregates, and correlating the behavior with the atmosphere in which it can be found was implemented through different leaching tests. The current study has reported some insights concerning the release of chromium from recycled concrete aggregates at different life cycle stages. The release results were correlated with the structure responsible for the potentially retention of Cr (VI) using characterization analysis and the interpretation of the pH-dependent release. 
		 The following conclusions, from an environmental point of view, can be drawn: 
		 1) The established pH-dependent release of Cr (VI) helped us to consider that carbonated RCA has a lower amount of released Cr (VI) from the cementitious matrix; this is explained by the fact that Cr (VI) is more stable at a range pH  11 
		 2) The release of Cr(VI) in the pH range of 10.5-11.8 is strongly linked to the structure in which it is contained: it has been proven in the literature and demonstrated in our case that it is mainly bonded to the ettringite-hydrated phase 
		 3) RCA containing Cr (VI) and used as waste in disposal scenario can be considered as inert wastes, in according to the classification of the European directive. The release of Cr (VI) from the new matrix is not very important, not exceeding 0.5 mg/L in the leachate for more than 64 days leaching tests 
		 4) RCA containing Cr (VI) can be used in road construction and as substitution of original components in new materials like in the case of concrete with recycled aggregates 
		 5) Regardless the origin or the percentage of the substitution of RCA, the release of Cr (VI) can be considered as negligible

<titre>Human Rights Council Holds Separate Interactive Dialogues with the Independent Experts on the Central African Republic and on Mali.</titre>

		Mar 21, 2017 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The Human Rights Council during its midday meeting held separate interactive dialogues with the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic, Marie-Therese Keita Bocoum, and with the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali, Suliman Baldo. 
		 Presenting her report, Ms. Keita Bocoum commended the Government of the Central African Republic for the progress made in drawing up the legislative and institutional framework, including appointing the Prosecutor to the Special Criminal Court. This was in stark contrast with the reality on the ground, where local conflicts were proliferating with surprising alliances forming in which nationalist and foreign groups opposed each other with dangerous ethnic connotations. Insecurity was the greatest problem for the civilian population, as armed groups ruled more than 60 per cent of the territory with total impunity. There had been no progress in restoring the effective authority of the State outside of Bangui. More than half the population was in acute need of humanitarian assistance, and more than 470,000 people were internally displaced. The Independent Expert regretted delays in the implementation of the national plan for the restauration and consolidation of peace, which risked the disengagement of the people and attempts to install peace by force of arms.
		Speaking as the concerned country, the Central African Republic stated that it needed the help and assistance of the international community. However, the international community's concern should not win because the expert's report was of concern. The effective restoration of the State's authority was slow in coming about. The crisis that the Central African Republic was experiencing seemed to have been put on the back burner by the international community, and the situation could escalate into an unspeakable ethnic war. 
		 In the ensuing discussion speakers welcomed the determination of the democratically elected authorities to end impunity in the Central African Republic, and the progress made since the Bangui forum on reconciliation. However, they remained concerned about the heightened level of violence and clashes between armed groups. The Government was encouraged to combat impunity, strengthen the judiciary, and to prosecute all those guilty of human rights violations, especially of crimes against children. Speakers stressed that good governance and the rule of law were key to achieving reconciliation and stability in the country. They called on armed groups to cease hostilities and to join the Government's disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. Several delegations appealed to the international community to provide urgent aid to the Central African Republic for development and for setting up a criminal court. 
		 Speaking were European Union, Tunisia on behalf of the African Group, France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Egypt, Netherlands, Benin, Algeria, United States, Sudan, Portugal, Togo, Congo, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Morocco. 
		 Also taking the floor were the following civil society organizations: World Evangelical Alliance, International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, and Rencontre Africaine pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme. 
		 During the meeting, the Council also discussed the situation of human rights in Mali with the Independent Expert, Suliman Baldo. 
		 Presenting his report, Mr. Baldo noted that although there had been positive developments in Mali, the security situation in the north remained volatile and it deprived many children of their right to education. Civilians were exposed to risks because of armed groups and bandits who were not controlled. This was also due to the terrorist groups who carried out abuses towards the civilians and preached radical Islam in central and northern Mali. The immediate response of the Government forces sometimes strayed from international standards. The consequence of all this was displacement of the population and the radicalization of youth who thought that injustice was carried out by the State. Impunity for violations and abuses remained a serious concern, and it had to end. Some progress had been made in transitional justice, with the opening of the regional office of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. But, the justice system was not able to attack impunity. 
		 Mali, speaking as the concerned country, expressed gratitude to the Human Rights Council for the assistance it had provided to the country in the field of the promotion and protection of human rights since the crisis it had faced in 2012. It explained that judicial authorities were making efforts to provide a response to all cases brought to their attention. All the incidents brought to judicial authorities were investigated and prosecuted, including cases involving the armed forces. The violations of human rights mentioned in the report were largely attributed to jihadi groups. 
		 In the discussion speakers welcomed the efforts of the Government of Mali in the area of human rights despite many challenges, such as the establishment of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, as well as tangible results made to relaunch economic development in the north of the country. They condemned the violations of human rights by extremist groups which had continued, particularly in the north and centre of the country. Poverty, inequalities and weak State authority had led to the expansion of extreme violence. Some speakers deplored the lack of a law that forbade female genital mutilation. The slow implementation of the 2015 Algiers peace accords had allowed the continued grave violations of children's rights committed by armed groups. Human rights had to be at the core of the development of the country to achieve sustainable peace and stability. 
		 Speaking were European Union, Tunisia on behalf of the African Group, United Nations Children's Fund, Denmark, France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Egypt, Netherlands, Benin, Algeria, Libya, United States, Sudan, Togo, Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Spain, Central African Republic, Morocco and Mozambique. 
		 Also taking the floor were the following non-governmental organizations: International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, International Service for Human Rights, and Rencontre Africaine pour la defense des droits de l'homme. 
		 The Council is having a full day of meetings today. At 1 p.m., it will hold an interactive dialogue with the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti, Gustavo Gallon. It will then hear the presentation of the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Libya, including on the investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner, followed by an interactive discussion.

<titre>Brexit and the City: Europe plots a bank heist</titre>
<auteur>FT REPORTERS</auteur>
<texte>
		On a rainy June morning in Paris, five dozen men and women gathered in a basement in <mention id="1964">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="1965">the city's financial district</mention>. Over bitter coffee and fluffy croissants, the great and the good of French politics, business and finance had gathered to plot a heist. 
		 With two weeks to go before the Brexit vote, they wanted to be ready with a sales pitch to lure the international financial groups based in London, should Britain vote to leave the EU. Now, they reasoned, any company with pan-European aspirations would be compelled to move jobs, business lines, even headquarters out of London.
		At the time hardly anyone seemed to believe that the UK electorate would really vote to leave. But that didn't stop the Parisien elite. Jean-Louis Missika, a deputy mayor of Paris, promised he would be "rolling out the red carpet" to bankers if Brexit happened. Gérard Mestrallet, head of the Paris Europlace lobby group, says this was "the moment" for Paris as a financial centre. 
		 It is a dramatic turning of the tables. Four years ago, Boris Johnson, the then London mayor turned Brexit frontman, who said on Thursday he would not enter the race to be next Conservative prime minister, was goading Paris for the "tyranny and terror" of its rich-soaking tax policies and inviting French bankers to escape to London.  "Vous êtes tous bienvenus,"  he boomed. 
		 This time it is Paris that is appealing to bankers in London with a "Welcome to Europe" slogan. 
		 The French charm offensive has been notably aggressive, but they are not alone. Frankfurt and Dublin - and a long list of others from Luxembourg to Warsaw - are now clamouring to appeal to the banks, insurance companies and asset managers for whom using the City of London as a single European hub may no longer be sensible. And where those financial services groups go, a whole host of ancillary roles - in law, accountancy, consultancy and the rest - will follow. Tens of thousands of jobs, out of nearly half a million in the City, could be at risk, financiers estimate. 
		 The sales pitch is simple. If the UK is outside the EU, financial services companies will be stripped of the "passporting" rules that allow them to operate across borders without local licences. Those companies will need instead to think about a new EU base. The City, which has grown and globalised since the Big Bang deregulation reforms 30 years ago, would shrink and deglobalise. 
		 Not everyone buys the argument. Some contend the City has an even brighter future as a centre focused less on Europe - excelling, for example, in offshore renminbi trading and financial technology. In any case, bullish British lawyers reckon that UK negotiators will be able to strike a deal to extend passporting. If that proves politically impossible, they point to new rules, under the so-called Mifid II rule book that comes into force in 2018. These should give any non-EU country with "equivalent" financial rules access to the single market on level terms. 
		 One snag is the risk of an EU country - like France - sensing a competitive opportunity and seeking to have the rules tweaked to disadvantage the UK. 
		 Even if a good deal is reached, says Simon Gleeson, a lawyer at Clifford Chance who advises many of the big banks, it may be academic. "Banks [will] have to write their contingency plans before they know the [political] situation that will exist in the future."  
		 In other words, a bank may need to decide to shift chunks of its business to more secure EU locations, regardless of what politicians manage to negotiate. 
		 Paris 
		For banks and investors, there is likely to be an added impetus to move at least some functions to an EU location if, as expected, the European Central Bank insists that future euro-denominated financial trades are cleared and settled within the EU.  
		 The question, then, is which city will win out? 
		 Paris can claim the prize for boldness. Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace, says he has already been in talks with half a dozen global banks. "They are shocked about the result, but looking to move people to Paris," he says. 
		 Promoters of Paris point to several strengths. It has an established financial ecosystem, with five of Europe's 20 largest banks by assets based there. It has a large funds industry managing€3.6tn, second only to London. It is also one of the world's great cities, with its wealth of opera houses, theatres and restaurants. Frankfurt cannot compare, they say. 
		 Paris is a corporate capital as well as a financial one, says Mr Mestrallet. "In Paris you find clients, whereas in Frankfurt you find rival banks," he says, arguing that Paris should be able to attract jobs in asset management, corporate bonds, foreign exchange and clearing. London currently dominates euro- 
		 denominated trading and clearing. 
		 Detractors highlight an uncertain political and fiscal environment, not least the possibility of a French referendum on EU membership. President François Hollande declared finance his "enemy" in 2012 as he proposed hitting the rich with a 75 per cent tax rate. Foreign banks point to high social charges. A€300,000 salary paid in the UK costs a bank€352,740 a year after all charges, while in France this same salary cost€471,799. Rules introduced in 2008 mean charges do not apply to foreigners for up to five years, but for long-term local staff it is expensive.  
		 Philippe Villin, an outspoken French investment banker and close adviser of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, says Paris will never become a major financial centre as long as corporate and personal taxes are so high. "At this stage, Paris is almost as appealing as Caracas or Havana for big banks and well-paid and wealthy professionals," he says. 
		 Lobbying groups say the reforms are coming. Ahead of the UK referendum the French government loosened rules for international bond issues. Reformers are also pushing to extend the advantageous tax status for foreigners and add more international schools. 
		 Frankfurt 
		Frankfurt has played its pitch cooler, but in many ways is a more natural contender to suck business from the City of London. "I think it is certainly possible that we could see around 10,000 jobs move from London to Frankfurt over the next five years," says Hubertus Väth, from Frankfurt Main Finance, a group that promotes the city as a financial centre. "German, Swiss and US banks are most likely to move." He says it is "relatively clear" that trading activities will shift to Frankfurt. 
		 Frankfurt's biggest trump card is the presence of the ECB, which not only sets eurozone monetary policy but now also supervises the bloc's biggest banks. "You can argue whether it is good to be the capital of regulation, but the ECB has definitely helped boost the city," says one top German banker. 
		 At the fulcrum of the London-Frankfurt see-saw is the increasingly fragile-looking merger deal between Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. The headquarters of the group were supposed to be in London - a decision the companies said would transcend the risk of Brexit and strengthen Germany's access to London's more vibrant capital market. But German regulators and politicians have made it clear that a London HQ would no longer be politically acceptable. One London-based banker close to the deal said such a stance betrayed the small-minded attitudes in Frankfurt that would stop it becoming a major financial centre. 
		 A broader issue militating against Frankfurt is the relative inflexibility of German labour law, such as how expensive it is to fire staff - a particular concern for US banks. Local groups have suggested to the German labour ministry that it consider setting up a zone in Frankfurt where British rather than German labour law is applied as a way of attracting bankers. 
		 Dublin 
		Dublin, the other EU financial centre with broad appeal, is portraying itself as a more natural fit with City types.  
		 "Dublin and Ireland are the closest you're going to get to London and the UK," says Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the inward investment agency, pointing to the English language, common laws and a skilled workforce. Industry leaders say the fact that Dublin already has an established finance industry - it has grown from nothing to employ 30,000 people in 25 years - is one of its key advantages. 
		 Dublin's biggest selling point may be that it is about 40 per cent cheaper than London for financial services groups, says Kieran Donoghue, head of international financial services at the IDA. Still, he says the scarcity of high-quality homes is "a pinch point". 
		 Other contenders 
		Alongside the likes of Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin is a long list of upstart challengers. These include locations that might not be obvious bases for glamorous "front-office" roles, but have nonetheless already drawn large numbers of backroom jobs from the City. 
		 Poland has quietly but rapidly become a big "nearshoring" location. More than 50,000 people are now employed by global banks there. "Nearshoring to Poland is only going to grow even further after Brexit," says Wojciech Poplawski, who heads Accenture's service centre operations in Warsaw. "There's EU access and competitive costs. It's a no-brainer." 
		 At the same time, locations outside Europe may also become more appealing. For banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase or HSBC, lawyers believe Brexit may be the trigger to shift some business to Asia or the US.  
		 For most banks, insurers and asset managers, the response to the rival pitches is unlikely to be straightforward. "It isn't obvious that you try to replicate London where you have everything in one city," says one senior UK-based banker. "Everywhere has deficiencies, nowhere is a perfect cluster like London," says another, describing French labour law as a "disaster". 
		 Instead, groups are expected to disburse employees around the region, depending on office capacity, existing licences and staff preferences. JPMorgan, for example, has licences in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin and may upgrade other locations such as Paris to fully fledged operations.  
		 "If we move roles to Europe, we have the option of distributing them across several locations," says one bank insider. "Not all our competitors do." 
		 Richard Gnodde, co-head of Goldman Sachs' international operations, headquartered in London, told a business summit in London this week: "If passporting was totally removed, we would have to adjust our footprint and where people were located." Goldman has a banking licence for its Frankfurt operation, which includes a small number of staff in securities sales and trading, making the city the most likely destination for any activities moved out of the UK. Goldman is also weighing other options such as Dublin and Amsterdam. 
		 The British banks facing the greatest disruption from any loss of passporting rights are Barclays and HSBC, which have the largest investment banking operations in the City dealing with clients from the continent. Barclays says it has an investment banking licence in Dublin. HSBC executives point to its sizeable trading floors in both Paris and Düsseldorf. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive, said before the vote that it may move as many as 1,000 jobs to Paris if the Leave campaign won. Among non-banks, fund manager M&amp;G has already decided to launch a new range of funds based in Ireland rather than the UK. 
		 Unless there is rapid political manoeuvring to reverse the process of Brexit, there is one certainty - parts of the City of London's fabric will soon start to unravel. But amid all the panic and jostling for business, there are those who sit back and say shrinkage may be no bad thing. 
		 A senior banker, who has large operations in London and Paris, takes a big-picture view. "The overconcentration of financial services in London and in the UK has done big societal damage, as the financial crisis demonstrated," he says. "It may be no bad thing for everyone if there is some redistribution across a number of other financial centres. If 50,000 out of 500,000 jobs move from the City to Paris or Frankfurt, so what?"

<titre>Will Brexit mean bargains for homebuyers?</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		The wailing and the weeping is impressive for such a sanguine nation but, before the UK howls itself into a Brexit-based residential property catastrophe, we have polished the collective crystal ball to look at a few themes in this sea of uncertainty around the high-end market in London and south-east England. 
		 Right now is a great time to buy for many international buyers. The fall in sterling means that dollar buyers earlier this week effectively enjoyed an 11 per cent discount compared with the day of the referendum vote. It is also a great time for some domestic buyers thanks to almost non-existent interest rates.
		That said, both Savills and Knight Frank have been warning for several months that London's prime market, historically more volatile than the rest of the country, would bear the brunt of the early Brexit fallout. This is the sector with the highest concentration of non-UK owners. In April the rating agency Moody's estimated that foreign nationals accounted for 49 per cent of sales of homes worth £1m and above. With Britain experiencing its biggest political experiment in a generation, it is likely that, villains or saviours, this group will play a pivotal role. 
		 Are they likely to exit because of Brexit? Few of London's super-rich consider the UK's membership of Europe's single market as a factor in choosing a London home, according to Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree Estates, who estimates that non-EU international buyers make up 70 to 80 per cent of this market. "These buyers do not care where Europe is at and they don't believe for a second that Brexit means that London's status as a property safe haven is at risk." 
		 Indeed, following the financial crisis when the UK and Europe were wobbling, these buyers didn't seem to care. Super-prime Mayfair is a favourite destination for many of them - at £2,300 per sq ft, according to Savills, average prices here are 18 per cent above the average in the rest of prime central London. From Mayfair's pricing low point in March 2009 to the end of 2012, a period spanning the end of the UK recession and the darkest days of the eurozone crisis, foreign buyers' appetite helped Mayfair prices gain 61 per cent, far outstripping the 28 per cent prime central London average, according to Savills. 
		 The priorities for this group of buyers were - and remain - personal safety, the rule of law, a favourable tax regime, good private schools and the great British tradition of political and economic stability, says Mark Parkinson of buying agent Middleton Advisors. While the Brexit turmoil appears, by British standards, to jeopardise the last of these factors, it is worth considering what these buyers are often used to elsewhere: capital controls in China and, increasingly, Russia; the president's impeachment and worst recession for decades in Brazil; a sinking oil price driving the first ever government bond issue in Saudi Arabia. 
		 Besides, for this group the fall in sterling goes much of the way towards offsetting the stamp duty rise introduced in December 2014 (now peaking at 15 per cent on any amount above the first £1.5m for a second home), says Naomi Heaton, chief executive of London Central Portfolio Limited, which manages close to £1bn in prime central London property. 
		 Brexit could, however, spell trouble for European bankers who have made their home in London. If the UK does leave the single market, many may find themselves posted abroad. Jefferies, the US investment bank, estimated before the referendum that an exit could see 100,000 banking jobs relocated to Europe. All but 500 of Goldman Sachs' 6,500-strong European workforce are based in London. 
		 They may not be in a rush to sell their homes if they can avoid it. This is hardly a time for dollar or euro investors to realise gains on London property. Earlier this week, a weaker pound meant that the average Kensington &amp; Chelsea home (valued at £1.315m) was worth roughly £110,000 less than on the day of the referendum vote for those banking in euros. Dollar owners, meanwhile, were £144,000 poorer. 
		 Even if continental Europeans start deserting the capital, the impact could be muted: only a third of prime London buyers from abroad are from the EU, according to Savills. Collectively, non-European international buyers are responsible for a fifth of all second-hand prime sales. 
		 For international buyers with the stomach for the volatility that may be in store, buying, rather than selling, looks appealing. The downward lurch in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote was the steep dismount at the end of a steady slide. Over the past six months, the combined effect of changes in average property values and shifts in exchange rates, has seen London's 5 per cent most expensive properties get 13 per cent cheaper for euro buyers, and 10 per cent cheaper for those with dollars, according to Hometrack. Over the same period sterling owners in this property elite have seen gains of 1 per cent. 
		 The impact on London's high-end, new-build market is hard to call but the supply-and-demand equation looks obvious: large numbers of units are coming on stream at the same time as prime central London prices are falling. 
		 About 19,000 new homes were under construction in inner London in May - 43 per cent more than 18 months earlier, according to research for the FT by Property Vision, a buying agency, and Dataloft, a research company. A total of 6,249 of them were located in SW8, says Anthony Codling of Jefferies, which includes the prime developments peppering Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Power Station. Codling adds that two-thirds of homes on sale in SW8 today are new - the second highest rate of any London postcode. 
		 Flighty buyers from abroad could threaten prices. Local agents say the new developments - where buyers typically put down between 10 per cent and 20 per cent at exchange and the rest when the homes are completed - have proved very popular with individual investors from Malaysia and China. 
		 With London's prime market cooling - average prices in prime central London have dropped 8 per cent since their peak in October 2014, according to Savills - many are now selling on the secondary market in order to avoid losses, says Johnny Male, of local agent Daniel Cobb. 
		 Developers dismiss the claims. The average gain for resales in the development of Battersea Power Station - where 1,500 flats have been sold since January 2013 - is 30 per cent, according to the developer Battersea Power Station Development Company. But it would not reveal resale price changes since October 2014 when London's prime market started falling.  
		 Heaton believes that average prices across the area's prime new-builds will fall 20 per over the next two to three years.  
		 Either way, deals are being struck according to some agents. "[Since the referendum] overseas investors have been coming forward with discounts on their offers," says Nanette Hung of CBRE, the agent selling One Nine Elms, which will include London's tallest residential building, and Nine Elms Point. "We have been doing a lot of haggling." 
		 If haggling is not your thing then the sub-£1m market in central London is worth examining. This represents half of the total housing stock, by number of properties, so there is plenty to choose from, particularly in places such as Bayswater, Pimlico, Paddington and Victoria. 
		 In the immediate future the big question is, as Judith Evans - the FT's property correspondent - puts it, "whether the new speculative investors will outweigh the people exiting, or those put off relocating to London, because of Brexit". 
		 Longer term, a positive outlook seems likely because London will probably hang on to its "world city" status. High employment levels may take a drubbing but some of its other world city qualities look like they will remain intact: a forgiving political and physical climate, English as the main language, good IT sector, handy timezone, flourishing arts, lush parkland and excellent global connections. 
		 One final thought. If prices in London and the south-east do fall more into line with properties in the rest of the country, even if only slightly, there is some cause for celebration. In some areas of the UK prices have never recovered to their pre-financial crisis levels. And while prices in the Midlands and the North have sunk 12.5 per cent since their 2007 peak, prime London has soared 35.2 per cent over the same period, according to Savills. 
		 As the referendum has vividly demonstrated, extreme inequality fractures society which is no good for anyone or anything, let alone the economy. 
		 FT writers on what could happen next 
		Judith Evans 
		Property correspondent 
		 From a state of near-overheating, Brexit has cast a sudden chill over the property market in London and the south-east. Early indications are that people are thinking more carefully before committing to large mortgages or moving to bigger homes. Some analysts predict prices will fall, others that they will flatten, but it seems clear the days of double-digit annual price rises have come to an end. 
		 Izabella Kaminska  
		FT Alphaville reporter 
		 On one hand, London property just got a lot cheaper for foreign buyers at the same time that the capital's offshore financial centre status vis-à-vis the rest of the world may have got a boost. On the other hand, it may see demand cut in half as workers flock back to the continent. While news from estate agents is mixed, concerns are growing for the buy-to-let and rental market. The view here is that an independent UK is unlikely to turn away high-skilled workers or the rich. More realistically the low-skilled sector will be affected, most of whom rent rather than buy. 
		 Jonathan Guthrie 
		City editor 
		 There should be a tumbleweed or two bowling around Canary Wharf, as investment banks relocate staff to the continent. High-end property in the Docklands, or with good transport links to it, should get a lot cheaper. Upmarket apartments across London should become more affordable. Whether they are decent investments depends on whether you believe the capital will continue to thrive if and when the UK quits the EU. 
		 Jamil Anderlini  
		Asia editor 
		 In recent years, mainland Chinese citizens have overtaken Russian citizens as the single biggest group of foreign buyers of London real estate. With the pound hitting historic lows, the rush by Chinese and other Asian investors is likely to accelerate. 
		 Merryn Somerset Webb 
		Editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek 
		 Property in central London was overvalued before the referendum vote. And it is still overvalued now. The good news? It is getting less overvalued. 
		 Adam Thomson 
		Paris correspondent 
		 Central London property prices have long been out of reach for ordinary mortals and Brexit won't change that. Paris may be pricey but London is ludicrous. Brexit is a potentially huge opportunity for the French capital to attract international banks and other financial institutions but there is a dearth of high-quality, centrally located office space. If the big banks do decide to move to Paris, they may have to get used to the idea of being in <mention id="1966">La Défense</mention> or other areas outside the capital's city limits. 
		 Sebastian Payne 
		Digital comment editor 
		 We will only find out the full economic impact of Brexit in a few months' time, but construction is already slowing and the housing market looks unstable. Although a fall in house prices would help those in my generation who have struggled to get on the ladder, the particular issue in London - high demand, low supply - remains unresolved. It is up to Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor, and the government to get building.

<titre>France sets up team in Brexit push to lure business from London</titre>
<auteur>MICHAEL STOTHARD</auteur>
<texte>
		France will this week step up efforts to attract business from London in the wake of the Brexit vote by appointing a team of corporate leaders and politicians to drive the campaign.  
		 Ross McInnes, an Oxford-educated Franco-Australian and chairman of Safran, the French engine maker, is to be named the "ambassador" heading efforts to lure UK-based companies to Paris, said people familiar with the decision.
		Valérie Pécresse, the centre-right president of the wider Paris region, and Anne Hidalgo, Paris's socialist mayor, will also be heavily involved in a sign that the initiative has cross-party support. 
		 An important focus will be attracting financial companies likely to be among the worst affected by the decision to leave the EU if they lose their "passporting" rights to operate across the bloc. Some banks, such as HSBC, have signalled that they could move jobs to Paris. 
		 The team will also target companies in the industrial, mining, energy and broader service sectors as they look at any businesses that chose to be based in the UK because of its EU membership, people close to the discussions said.  
		 Setting up the team is the latest step in a multipronged approach adopted by France as several European states compete to attract businesses that decide to move part or all of their operations from the UK. 
		 Immediately after the June 23 referendum, President François Hollande's Socialist government changed the tax rules for expatriates in Paris to make it more generous.  
		 "We want to build the financial capital of the future . . . now is the time to come to France," Manuel Valls, French prime minister, said in July.  
		 In September, French financial regulators said they were simplifying the process of registering new financial companies in Paris, in part by allowing documents to be filed in English. They said this came "in the context of the Brexit vote". 
		 <mention id="1967">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> this month unveiled an advertising campaign aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, with the slogan: "Tired of the fog? Try the frogs!". 
		 There have also been discussions between French business groups and the government about introducing a special labour code for financial workers, in effect making it easier to hire and fire them than other workers in France.  
		 The inflexibility of the French labour code, along with high taxes, is one of the main reasons some financial groups say they will be reluctant to move to Paris. 
		 But the idea of a special rule for finance workers has been ruled out by the government, mainly on constitutional grounds. "We cannot have a specific status for jobs in the financial sector," Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said last week. 
		 Senior British-based bankers are doubtful that French politicians will propose any sweeteners to attract business from the UK before next year's presidential election.  
		 One banker said he viewed any French promises with scepticism because its parliament recently voted to strengthen its financial transaction tax. He said his bank had been lobbied by French, German and Luxembourg representatives.  
		 The UK-based banking executive said the French delegation had asked for a "wish list" of reforms his bank would want before choosing Paris ahead of other cities to relocate British operations in the event of a hard Brexit. 
		 Mr McInnes started his career in 1977 with Kleinwort Benson bank in London. He was previously at Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group now called Thales, and has worked for Kering as well as Safran, where he was chief financial officer from 2011 to 2015.  
		 He was appointed as France's "special representative" for economic relations with Australia this year. 
		 Other heavy-hitters involved in the process include Christian Noyer, the former governor of the French central bank, who has been doing unofficial lobbying on behalf of the government.  
		 Gerald Mestrallet, chairman of Paris-based utility group Engie, is also involved as president of Paris Europlace, a lobby group to promote Paris as a financial centre.

<titre>London rivals struggle to prepare for Brexit fallout</titre>
<auteur>JUDITH EVANS</auteur>
<texte>
		"Welcome to FrankfurtRheinMain," declares a website set up by the German region, which went live after the UK voted to leave the EU. It offers a 24-hour UK-based hotline for companies thinking of opening an office in the area. 
		 Frankfurt is one of several major European cities to have launched a charm offensive since the June referendum, aiming to lure businesses - especially financial services - that are reassessing their UK presence after the Brexit vote. Paris's financial regulator is offering fast-track registration; Dublin has caught the eye of one of the continent's largest stock exchanges, Bats Europe, as a possible location for a second headquarters.
		Red carpets are being rolled out all over Europe. But cities seeking to attract large departments of blue-chip businesses must also provide something more practical: office space. 
		 Matthew Fitzgerald, head of European tenant representation at Savills, says that immediately after the Brexit vote in June, phones began ringing at his company with a series of requests for data - office rents in Dublin, living costs in Frankfurt, property taxes in Paris. 
		 "A lot of heads of real estate at banks received directives from the top: 'If we had to do an emergency move, what is it going to cost us?'" he says. 
		 In some respects, the answers were reassuring. Occupying an office in another European city is generally far cheaper than in London: top-grade office space in the UK capital costs $243 per square foot per year, including rent, service charges and taxes, while a square foot in Paris is $90 a year and, in Dublin, $76, Savills says. Frankfurt and Amsterdam come in even cheaper, at $55 and $53 respectively. 
		 But this does not tell the whole story. No other European city can rival London's prime office stock, built up thanks to its position as the continent's main financial centre. Vacancy rates across the continent's major cities, meanwhile, are at their lowest rates for a decade, while developers - still bruised from the debt-fuelled building boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis - have been slower to construct new office buildings, leading to a shortage of space. 
		 When it comes to potential relocations, the UK's financial sector is a particular focus, because both overseas and UK companies make use of "passporting" rights under the EU's single market to sell products into other EU countries. If passporting ends, investment banks such as Morgan Stanley say they will move parts of their London operations on to the continent. Other groups have said they may shift operations pre-emptively as Brexit negotiations will take at least two years. 
		 Should a bank seek office space immediately for 2,000 people in the central business district of a European city, they would currently find eight options in Paris, all in <mention id="1968">La Défense</mention> in the west central area of the city, according to Savills research. 
		 In Frankfurt, five such spaces are currently available, while another one to three are expected to come on the market in the next two years.  
		 Madrid, Dublin and Amsterdam each offer a single option, and in Amsterdam that building is still under development. "I am sure the number would be reduced further if we were to define specific requirements with a bank," says Mr Fitzgerald. Any of these options would require a 10-year lease agreement, he added, making them unsuitable for short-term arrangements. 
		 More spaces are available if a company is only looking to relocate 1,000 staff: in Paris, for example, some 16 deals for offices of this size have been done in the past two years. The French capital has the largest overall office stock of any European capital outside London, and a vacancy rate of 7 per cent compared with London rates varying between 3.2 and 5.2 per cent across the West End, City and Canary Wharf. 
		 If companies take action to move to another European jurisdiction, that could spur new office development, but only if they are prepared to sign pre-let agreements on new space, agents say.  
		 Dublin, with its proximity to London, low corporation tax, links with the US and English-speaking population, has been a particular focus of interest, says Mr Fitzgerald. Nick Coveney, director of business space at Colliers in Dublin, says he is working with a London-based boutique financial consultancy looking to set up a base in the city ahead of Brexit negotiations to secure their EU foothold. "They want the absolute premier office space in Dublin," he says. 
		 Companies are assessing other factors beyond property: rates of corporate and other tax, salaries, regulation, the ease of recruiting workers and the potential or otherwise to persuade senior staff to relocate to a given city.  
		 Housing for staff is another concern: "In Dublin we have a shortage of very high-end housing within a relatively easy commute of the city," says Marie Hunt, executive director for Ireland at the property advisers CBRE. "A lot of work is going into improving that, but there isn't sufficient housing today." 
		 High housing costs will result in pressures on salaries and allowances paid out by companies. In Dublin, Amsterdam and Brussels, 90 per cent of the total cost of relocating new workers to the cities can be taken up by subsidising their initial housing arrangements, according to Savills. 
		 Despite the initial flurry of inquiries, most companies are waiting to find out at least the parameters of Brexit negotiations before proceeding, agents say. "Most people are doing their homework now and will make decisions over the next two years," says Ms Hunt. 
		 For those that do move staff, no consensus destination has emerged so far, says Mr Fitzgerald. "Given that there is still no obvious successor to London, it's likely that it could take several years to see a financial of cluster of a similar scale. It would be fair assumption for banks to spread their workforce given business requirements."

<titre>Paris: can the City of Love woo the world of finance from London?</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		What a difference a (possible) Brexit makes. Four years ago France's new president, François Hollande, taking aim at the wealthy, had bankers squarely in his sights. "My true adversary is the world of finance," he had said during the campaign, touting a Franco-German pact to attack the "dominance of finance" and tilt Europe back towards traditional industry. In office, he launched a 75 per cent supertax on earnings above€1m and hiked France's wealth tax, the annual levy on valuable assets. 
		 The supertax was quietly shelved at the beginning of last year. By July this year, with the prospect of a UK exit from the EU - which could result in many companies in London's financial sector seeking out a new base - Hollande's administration was in full U-turn mode.
		Manuel Valls, the prime minister, unveiled Europe's "most favourable" fiscal regime for foreign executives. It would include an income tax break of up to 50 per cent on executives who relocated and exclude foreign assets from the wealth tax for eight years (the current exclusion period is five years). "Paris as a financial centre is what makes France's attractiveness," said Valls, to cheers from his audience of leading executives. 
		 On the face of it, the French capital is well positioned to benefit from a Brexit. Of Europe's major cities, only London has a larger economy of financial and business services (lawyers, recruitment firms and the like), according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. The $350bn annual output of Paris may be less than London's $490bn but it is far ahead of third-placed Moscow's $166bn. 
		 Europe's second-largest financial and business services sector will not be the only draw for London's wealthy tech and banker types. Hollande's single-minded pursuit of affluent Parisians led to rich locals leaving in droves in the years following his election. Top-end prices fell sharply, leaving averages in this sector less than half that of equivalent homes in London. According to Knight Frank, prime Paris homes sell for between€14,600 and€17,800 per sq metre, compared with a range of€33,000 to€40,300 in London. Over the past three years, prime Paris prices have fallen more than 8 per cent, against a 6.4 per cent gain in London. Over one year, there have been falls of, respectively, 3.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent. 
		 London's bankers may be delighted at 50 per cent discounts on purchase prices compared with the UK capital, but the costs of keeping a French home are far higher. The French price falls derive in large part from the wealth tax, say agents.  
		 Last tweaked in 2013, this covers properties valued at€1.3m and above. At€1.3m, it means a 0.5 per cent annual levy of the property's value above€800,000. The marginal rate then increases, in several steps, to 1.5 per cent - at least€150,000 a year - for homes worth more than€10m.  
		 No wonder some of Paris' finest homes in the fashionable, if dull, 16th and 17th arrondissements are now readily available. "Where large family apartments had been hard to come by, suddenly they were two a penny," says Roddy Aris of Knight Frank. 
		 Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, of agent Daniel Féau, says the stock of top-end homes has risen 40 per cent since Hollande was elected. The agent has a large five-bedroom apartment on sale in the 17th for€2.85m. For those who hanker for some outside space, the same agent is selling a four-bedroom house with a large garden on the edge of La Muette neighbourhood for€4.75m. 
		 What Hollande's tax tilt did for international buyers is a moot point. Few earn an income in Paris, meaning that they avoided the supertax; many more dodged the wealth tax by funding their purchases with mortgages rather than cash. (The proportion of a home's value borrowed from the bank does not attract the tax.)  
		 Meanwhile, a weakening euro has made the city more appealing to those with dollars to spend. Middle Eastern buyers - long-time fans of the city - returned to the 16th and 17th arrondissements, where they can fit their staff into the large apartments and their motorcades into generous underground car parks, says Lundgreen.  
		 In the city's centre - a smaller pool of generally smaller flats in the narrower historic streets across the 6th and 7th arrondissements - the tax-fuelled exodus took the pressure off overheated prices. In areas such as the Latin Quarter, small pieds-à-terre were commanding up to€20,000 per sq metre, says Aris. "In the last 12 to 18 months prices have come off and local buyers are returning," he says.  
		 Nearby on Rue de Bourgogne, in the 7th, Savills is marketing a two-bedroom apartment for€1.99m.  
		 Buyers from the US - also long-term fans of Paris - are joining them. They have started to return to their favoured Left Bank, south of the Seine as it passes Notre-Dame, says Aris. Despite the prime price falls, the finest flats in the 6th arrondissement still command prices comparable to the grandest in London's Chelsea, says Kate Everett-Allen of Knight Frank. " Mais bien sûr ," you can hear Hollande retort.

<titre>Will Brexit mean bargains for homebuyers?</titre>
<auteur>HUGO COX</auteur>
<texte>
		The wailing and the weeping is impressive for such a sanguine nation but, before the UK howls itself into a Brexit-based residential property catastrophe, we have polished the collective crystal ball to look at a few themes in this sea of uncertainty around the high-end market in London and south-east England. 
		 Right now is a great time to buy for many international buyers. The fall in sterling means that dollar buyers earlier this week effectively enjoyed an 11 per cent discount compared with the day of the referendum vote. It is also a great time for some domestic buyers thanks to almost non-existent interest rates.
		That said, both Savills and Knight Frank have been warning for several months that London's prime market, historically more volatile than the rest of the country, would bear the brunt of the early Brexit fallout. This is the sector with the highest concentration of non-UK owners. In April the rating agency Moody's estimated that foreign nationals accounted for 49 per cent of sales of homes worth £1m and above. With Britain experiencing its biggest political experiment in a generation, it is likely that, villains or saviours, this group will play a pivotal role. 
		 Are they likely to exit because of Brexit? Few of London's super-rich consider the UK's membership of Europe's single market as a factor in choosing a London home, according to Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree Estates, who estimates that non-EU international buyers make up 70 to 80 per cent of this market. "These buyers do not care where Europe is at and they don't believe for a second that Brexit means that London's status as a property safe haven is at risk." 
		 Indeed, following the financial crisis when the UK and Europe were wobbling, these buyers didn't seem to care. Super-prime Mayfair is a favourite destination for many of them - at £2,300 per sq ft, according to Savills, average prices here are 18 per cent above the average in the rest of prime central London. From Mayfair's pricing low point in March 2009 to the end of 2012, a period spanning the end of the UK recession and the darkest days of the eurozone crisis, foreign buyers' appetite helped Mayfair prices gain 61 per cent, far outstripping the 28 per cent prime central London average, according to Savills. 
		 The priorities for this group of buyers were - and remain - personal safety, the rule of law, a favourable tax regime, good private schools and the great British tradition of political and economic stability, says Mark Parkinson of buying agent Middleton Advisors. While the Brexit turmoil appears, by British standards, to jeopardise the last of these factors, it is worth considering what these buyers are often used to elsewhere: capital controls in China and, increasingly, Russia; the president's impeachment and worst recession for decades in Brazil; a sinking oil price driving the first ever government bond issue in Saudi Arabia. 
		 Besides, for this group the fall in sterling goes much of the way towards offsetting the stamp duty rise introduced in December 2014 (now peaking at 15 per cent on any amount above the first £1.5m for a second home), says Naomi Heaton, chief executive of London Central Portfolio Limited, which manages close to £1bn in prime central London property. 
		 Brexit could, however, spell trouble for European bankers who have made their home in London. If the UK does leave the single market, many may find themselves posted abroad. Jefferies, the US investment bank, estimated before the referendum that an exit could see 100,000 banking jobs relocated to Europe. All but 500 of Goldman Sachs' 6,500-strong European workforce are based in London. 
		 They may not be in a rush to sell their homes if they can avoid it. This is hardly a time for dollar or euro investors to realise gains on London property. Earlier this week, a weaker pound meant that the average Kensington &amp; Chelsea home (valued at £1.315m) was worth roughly £110,000 less than on the day of the referendum vote for those banking in euros. Dollar owners, meanwhile, were £144,000 poorer. 
		 Even if continental Europeans start deserting the capital, the impact could be muted: only a third of prime London buyers from abroad are from the EU, according to Savills. Collectively, non-European international buyers are responsible for a fifth of all second-hand prime sales. 
		 For international buyers with the stomach for the volatility that may be in store, buying, rather than selling, looks appealing. The downward lurch in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote was the steep dismount at the end of a steady slide. Over the past six months, the combined effect of changes in average property values and shifts in exchange rates, has seen London's 5 per cent most expensive properties get 13 per cent cheaper for euro buyers, and 10 per cent cheaper for those with dollars, according to Hometrack. Over the same period sterling owners in this property elite have seen gains of 1 per cent. 
		 The impact on London's high-end, new-build market is hard to call but the supply-and-demand equation looks obvious: large numbers of units are coming on stream at the same time as prime central London prices are falling. 
		 About 19,000 new homes were under construction in inner London in May - 43 per cent more than 18 months earlier, according to research for the FT by Property Vision, a buying agency, and Dataloft, a research company. A total of 6,249 of them were located in SW8, says Anthony Codling of Jefferies, which includes the prime developments peppering Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Power Station. Codling adds that two-thirds of homes on sale in SW8 today are new - the second highest rate of any London postcode. 
		 Flighty buyers from abroad could threaten prices. Local agents say the new developments - where buyers typically put down between 10 per cent and 20 per cent at exchange and the rest when the homes are completed - have proved very popular with individual investors from Malaysia and China. 
		 With London's prime market cooling - average prices in prime central London have dropped 8 per cent since their peak in October 2014, according to Savills - many are now selling on the secondary market in order to avoid losses, says Johnny Male, of local agent Daniel Cobb. 
		 Developers dismiss the claims. The average gain for resales in the development of Battersea Power Station - where 1,500 flats have been sold since January 2013 - is 30 per cent, according to the developer Battersea Power Station Development Company. But it would not reveal resale price changes since October 2014 when London's prime market started falling.  
		 Heaton believes that average prices across the area's prime new-builds will fall 20 per over the next two to three years.  
		 Either way, deals are being struck according to some agents. "[Since the referendum] overseas investors have been coming forward with discounts on their offers," says Nanette Hung of CBRE, the agent selling One Nine Elms, which will include London's tallest residential building, and Nine Elms Point. "We have been doing a lot of haggling." 
		 If haggling is not your thing then the sub-£1m market in central London is worth examining. This represents half of the total housing stock, by number of properties, so there is plenty to choose from, particularly in places such as Bayswater, Pimlico, Paddington and Victoria. 
		 In the immediate future the big question is, as Judith Evans - the FT's property correspondent - puts it, "whether the new speculative investors will outweigh the people exiting, or those put off relocating to London, because of Brexit". 
		 Longer term, a positive outlook seems likely because London will probably hang on to its "world city" status. High employment levels may take a drubbing but some of its other world city qualities look like they will remain intact: a forgiving political and physical climate, English as the main language, good IT sector, handy timezone, flourishing arts, lush parkland and excellent global connections. 
		 One final thought. If prices in London and the south-east do fall more into line with properties in the rest of the country, even if only slightly, there is some cause for celebration. In some areas of the UK prices have never recovered to their pre-financial crisis levels. And while prices in the Midlands and the North have sunk 12.5 per cent since their 2007 peak, prime London has soared 35.2 per cent over the same period, according to Savills. 
		 As the referendum has vividly demonstrated, extreme inequality fractures society which is no good for anyone or anything, let alone the economy. 
		 FT writers on what could happen next 
		Judith Evans 
		Property correspondent 
		 From a state of near-overheating, Brexit has cast a sudden chill over the property market in London and the south-east. Early indications are that people are thinking more carefully before committing to large mortgages or moving to bigger homes. Some analysts predict prices will fall, others that they will flatten, but it seems clear the days of double-digit annual price rises have come to an end. 
		 Izabella Kaminska  
		FT Alphaville reporter 
		 On one hand, London property just got a lot cheaper for foreign buyers at the same time that the capital's offshore financial centre status vis-à-vis the rest of the world may have got a boost. On the other hand, it may see demand cut in half as workers flock back to the continent. While news from estate agents is mixed, concerns are growing for the buy-to-let and rental market. The view here is that an independent UK is unlikely to turn away high-skilled workers or the rich. More realistically the low-skilled sector will be affected, most of whom rent rather than buy. 
		 Jonathan Guthrie 
		City editor 
		 There should be a tumbleweed or two bowling around Canary Wharf, as investment banks relocate staff to the continent. High-end property in the Docklands, or with good transport links to it, should get a lot cheaper. Upmarket apartments across London should become more affordable. Whether they are decent investments depends on whether you believe the capital will continue to thrive if and when the UK quits the EU. 
		 Jamil Anderlini  
		Asia editor 
		 In recent years, mainland Chinese citizens have overtaken Russian citizens as the single biggest group of foreign buyers of London real estate. With the pound hitting historic lows, the rush by Chinese and other Asian investors is likely to accelerate. 
		 Merryn Somerset Webb 
		Editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek 
		 Property in central London was overvalued before the referendum vote. And it is still overvalued now. The good news? It is getting less overvalued. 
		 Adam Thomson 
		Paris correspondent 
		 Central London property prices have long been out of reach for ordinary mortals and Brexit won't change that. Paris may be pricey but London is ludicrous. Brexit is a potentially huge opportunity for the French capital to attract international banks and other financial institutions but there is a dearth of high-quality, centrally located office space. If the big banks do decide to move to Paris, they may have to get used to the idea of being in <mention id="1971">La Défense</mention> or other areas outside the capital's city limits. 
		 Sebastian Payne 
		Digital comment editor 
		 We will only find out the full economic impact of Brexit in a few months' time, but construction is already slowing and the housing market looks unstable. Although a fall in house prices would help those in my generation who have struggled to get on the ladder, the particular issue in London - high demand, low supply - remains unresolved. It is up to Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor, and the government to get building.

<titre>Could Amsterdam be Europe's new capital of finance?</titre>
<auteur>HANNAH ROBERTS</auteur>
<texte>
		In the Middle Ages, the residents of the inhospitable, low-lying bog, where present-day Amsterdam stands, were forced to co-operate to survive. Overcoming differences in lifestyle and religion in favour of common interest, they teamed up and built dykes to keep the sea out of the "polder", as the land behind was called. 
		 This early social co-operation resulted in the Dutch word  poldermodel , meaning consensus decision-making, and is often credited as the basis for the city's famous liberalism and tolerance. "The Netherlands owes its existence to a democracy of dry feet," is how Dutch writer Herman Pleij put it. Amsterdam's progressive spirit has certainly helped to give this small city cosmopolitan appeal, which continues to draw international investors today. 
		Which is handy because, since the vote for Brexit, several EU cities have been lining up to challenge London as the capital of European finance. According to the New York Times - which rated factors including infrastructure, office space, cultural offerings and the prevalence of the English language - Amsterdam is in pole position. 
		 Some tech companies have already set up bases in the city - WeTransfer, Booking.com and TomTom - but time will tell if the country's cap of 20 per cent of salary on bankers' bonuses introduced last year will deter some financial institutions from relocating.  
		 If top earners do relocate, they will find a property market in bullish mood. In the past 18 months, house prices have surged thanks to the economic recovery of the Netherlands, and a shortage of housing stock, as well as low interest rates of about 2 per cent. Prices dropped 15 per cent after the 2008 financial crisis, but have now overtaken pre-crisis levels and are setting new records in the best areas, according to several agents.  
		 House prices in Amsterdam rose 17 per cent in 2015, according to figures released by the Dutch Association of Estate Agents and Valuers. It has been a rapid rise, says Leslie de Ruiter of Christie's International Real Estate, which recently sold a 1,450 sq metre apartment for€16m. "In the best parts of Amsterdam we are exploring new highs in terms of property prices," he says, with a quarter of sales now above€1m. 
		 The best parts of the city are now 5 or 6 per cent above 2008 prices, according to Barbara Van der Grijp of Engel &amp; Volkers. The agency recently set a new record price in the city of€22,000 per sq metre after selling a house for€8m. 
		 Bidding above the asking price is becoming the norm, she says. "There can be 50 people at every viewing and 10 bids." A former museum, converted into an 18-bedroom mixed-use property, that the agency sold 18 months ago for€7.5m is back on the market for€15m. 
		 In some cases international investors, primarily from the US and UK, are buying a second home to use as a European pied-à-terre. "People come on holiday, see the old city and fall in love. Amsterdam makes every top 10 list for happiness and quality of life," she says.  
		 Engel &amp; Volkers is selling an 18th-century canal house with a patio garden for€10m. The six-bedroom property features original stucco, marble and woodcarving, and has a basement pool. 
		 There are signs however that the market may be overheating, with insufficient new supply to meet demand. The number of sales in the first quarter of 2016 fell 2 per cent year on year.  
		 However, the city is still cheap compared with Düsseldorf, Paris and London, says Gaby Balkema of Dutch agency Thuis in Vastgoed. Homes rarely sell for more than€15,000 per sq metre and the country has no capital gains tax. 
		 Foreigners tend to buy homes on the banks of the Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Herengracht canals or in the Old South, near the Vondelpark, says Balkema, who likens the area to Chelsea in London or New York's Upper East Side. Christie's International Real Estate is marketing a six-bedroom villa next to the Vondelpark for€11.75m. 
		 New areas such as Zuidas, a financial district comparable with London's Canary Wharf or <mention id="1972">La Défense</mention> in Paris, are also becoming more popular.  
		 Hugo Lindsay, a lawyer for a technology company who moved to Amsterdam from London last year, bought a four-bedroom apartment in a historic building next to the Rijksmuseum "for the same price as a two-bedroom flat in Tooting, [south London]". Lindsay, 45, says the quality of life is "extraordinary" compared with London. "You work fewer hours and you have everything you need: culture, food, and open spaces, in a small city, which is much faster to get in and out of."  
		 Amsterdam still has a way to go if it is to supplant London, though. It has a population of less than 1m, fewer theatres less sporting opportunities and most shops are closed by 6pm.  
		 Buyers in the city centre, especially those on canals, should also be wary of subsidence. For centuries, as in Venice, houses in Amsterdam have been built on up to 20-metre-long timber piles (now often replaced with concrete), which are forced through the layers of mud and clay to reach solid ground. Foundation beams are then laid on top.  
		 Whether the growing demand for property in the city is founded on more solid ground remains to be seen.  
		 Buying guide 
		â— Buyers need their own agent to help alert them to homes they wouldn't otherwise find. Yet if you do discover a property independently, they may still charge a fee 
		 â— Allow 6 per cent of the purchase price for fees and charges  
		 â— Apartment buildings are managed by an owners' association, which can be poorly run, or in debt, so check its status  
		 What you can buy for . . . 
		€1m  A two or three-bedroom apartment in the city centre 
		 €2m  A small house in the Old South  
		 €4m  A smart, six-bedroom canal house

<titre>Real estate investors braced for tide to turn</titre>
<auteur>JUDITH EVANS</auteur>
<texte>
		Global real estate has enjoyed two plentiful years - attracting $700bn in direct investment in 2015 and slightly more the year before, not far from the record $758bn achieved in 2007, according to the Chicago-based estate agency JLL. 
		 But 2016 began with equity and bond markets in turmoil, while prices for buildings in key office centres such as London and New York have been coming off record highs. That left the industry with one question to answer: has the market peaked?
		"The bloom has come off the rose a bit in terms of real estate valuations," says Jon Zehner, global head of client capital group at LaSalle Investment Management, one of the world's largest real estate fund managers. "The prime market in gateway cities needed to stabilise - it was getting too hot. This could be an appropriate correction. A period of more stable values and maybe a little less passion in the market is what we're envisioning for the year." 
		 Elisabeth Troni, global real estate strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management, says the company's indicators show "late cycle risks" and it predicts that values will fall in 2016, with the UK market "flat to declining". But she adds: "We're not foreseeing a crash." 
		 A crucial question is the direction of investor appetite. A wave of institutional capital has surged into real estate over the past two years, driven by the search for returns.  
		 That capital has increasingly crossed borders and continents: 20 per cent of real estate deals in 2015 were cross-border, according to Savills. It has also helped to push values up for income-generating "alternative" real estate, such as student accommodation. 
		 Yet according to research late last year by Hodes Weill, the real estate advisers, and Cornell University, institutions remain "significantly underinvested" in property, by an average 110 basis points compared to their own targets. 
		 Property investments are still able to offer more income than other asset classes, which is one of their key selling points. Even US offices, one of the most highly priced sectors in the world, offer a 370 basis point premium over yields from 10-year government bonds, according to figures from Green Street Advisors. 
		 Axa Investment Managers has just raised€500m for a new core real estate fund and has ambitions to expand the vehicle to€5bn. Its launch was driven by growing allocations from pension funds, especially in the Nordics and Benelux region, says Isabelle Scemama, global head of real asset finance. 
		 On the other hand, says Mr Zehner at LaSalle, drops in bond and equity values mean some institutions in the UK, US and Australia are reducing their property holdings this year to stay within fixed allocation boundaries. 
		 As the oil price remains low and China's markets weak, an important question is whether the Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and Asian corporates that have been snapping up big-ticket assets will remain active. 
		 So far, the signals are mixed. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's second-largest sovereign wealth fund, acquired <meronyme id="1973">the planned Tour Alto</meronyme> office development in <mention id="1974">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> in February, a sign of continued activity in the market. 
		 However, Walter Boettcher, director of research and forecasting at Colliers, the estate agency, says: "There are clear signs that continued low oil prices will impact oil sovereign strategies, especially when combined with other market events."  
		 Malaysian funds have been selling overseas real estate assets over the past year to repatriate capital as their home country suffers from the oil slump. 
		 Within east Asia, market turmoil does not so far appear to have hurt demand for real estate: investment volumes into Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese property were up 47 per cent, 66 per cent and 18 per cent respectively in 2015 from a year earlier, according to JLL. Chinese investment into Europe meanwhile appears to be on the increase, says Mr Boettcher - though Asian investors are switching their focus to continental Europe from the highly-priced UK.  
		 "A lot of the money coming out of China to invest in real estate is not institutional. It's corporates or ultra-high-net-worth [individuals]," says Mr Zehner. "The volatility and depreciation in the renminbi have actually seemed to encourage them to invest outside of China - they are looking for stability, diversification and more stable currencies, at least for now." 
		 Agents expect significant new flows from Japan. There Japan Post Bank - which has a $500bn investment fund - has said it aims to divert more cash into global risk assets including real estate. At least two other major Japanese institutions are also looking to expand their overseas property holdings, said Richard DiVall, head of cross-border capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Colliers. 
		 Investors' first concern remains the level of demand for buildings on the ground. In developed markets, banks' unwillingness to lend for speculative development has led to much tighter supply than in the last cycle, say analysts, as well as less financial risk. 
		 They point to a bright spot in Australia, where real estate on the country's east coast has suffered less than expected from the commodities slump. "The office markets and labour markets have surprised repeatedly in recent months. The markets had been preparing for a downturn but they have been positively surprised on net income growth," says Ms Troni of Aberdeen Asset Management. 
		 Private equity investors are meanwhile turning their attention to Italy, where the government is moving to improve private investors' opportunities to profitably access non-performing real estate loans, while economic recovery there has also drawn the attention of sovereign wealth funds, which have been buying up Milan property. 
		 For "higher-octane returns", La Salle is looking to the US and Asia, seeing opportunities for bargains driven by distressed sellers bitten by Chinese economic and market turbulence. 
		 On a broader scale, demographics are driving up interest in residential property. This segment's share of overall investment in the property market has almost doubled to 18 per cent since the downturn, according to Savills.  
		 Homes for millennials in developed economies and the middle class in emerging countries are seen as profitable plays on long-term trends, as are the warehouse sites that cater for their online shopping. 
		 In the shorter term, Mr Boettcher argues "it is too soon to declare an end to the bull market" in commercial property. From New York to Shanghai, investors will be hoping he is right.

<titre>Notebook: Paris needs to acquire a head for heights</titre>
<auteur>ADAM THOMSON</auteur>
<texte>
		For generations, Paris's wide boulevards and elegant balconied buildings have dazzled tourists and given the French capital one of the most beautiful and recognisable faces of any city.  
		 But when it comes to being competitive in the 21st century, the legacy of Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who oversaw the rebuilding of the city between 1853 and 1870, is one big pain in the backside.
		Whatever you think of London's rapidly changing skyline, it has played a critical role in keeping the city in step with the modern world. The UK's capital has more than 20 projects of 50 storeys or more, either under way or in the pipeline, that will provide homes for billionaires and global corporations alike. 
		 In Paris, things are a little different. Before Christmas, Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest listed commercial property company, applied for a permit to start construction of a 180-metre tall glass triangle of offices, hotel and convention centres designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron. 
		 If it goes ahead, as expected, the project - designed so as to cast almost no shadow on other buildings in the 15th arrondissement - will be the city's first skyscraper in more than 40 years. 
		 It is easy to understand the lack of modernisation: Paris's architecture is more uniform than that of London and the city is considerably smaller, offering fewer opportunities for developers. But even by the most conservative standards, Paris has proved remarkably resistant to change. 
		 Just ask Bernard Arnault: the billionaire behind luxury conglomerate LVMH spent more than a decade fighting in court for his planned redevelopment of the La Samaritaine department store.  
		 Its proposed Rue de Rivoli façade, a shimmering glass curtain, bombed with residents and preservation groups. Mr Arnault eventually got his way but only by appealing in the Conseil d'État, the country's ultimate authority for administrative matters. 
		 Meanwhile, the last skyscraper Paris inaugurated was the 1973 Tour Montparnasse, the unloved 210m block that dominates the city's southern skyline. Bad experiences like that have made it harder to push for new projects.  
		 Over a recent lunch in Unibail-Rodamco's "model room", a space in its Paris headquarters filled with exquisite skyscraper designs converted into 3D form from the sketchpads of the world's best-known architects, I got a sense of how hard it is.  
		 "You see that?" Christophe Cuvillier, the company's chief executive, asked me, pointing to an intriguing model of a Renzo Piano design for an island in the Seine. "It'll never be built. Planning permission is impossible." He points to another model near by. "Nor that one," he says. "Nor that," waving a finger at yet another.  
		 "Paris is very protective, which is great for charm and cultural history, but it has the immediate consequence of leaving no new space." 
		 The strict codes - bar some exceptions, buildings cannot exceed 31 metres - have left the city woefully short of good offices. So much so that Mr Cuvillier says that if a company of 700 employees or more wanted to settle in Paris in new or refurbished premises, it would be able to choose from just one of two sites.  
		 Why should any of this matter when the city has <mention id="1975">La Défense</mention>? <mention id="1976">The area, just beyond the capital's western border</mention>, has for years acted as Paris's safety valve for office space and it is now <mention id="1977">Europe's largest business district</mention>. 
		 One reason, argues Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor who is in charge of urban planning, is that a city cannot stay relevant if all it does is preserve the old.  
		 Paris, he insists, "has to renew itself century after century". As part of that effort, the mayor's office this month unveiled the winning projects of its "Reinvent Paris" competition to develop 23 sites. 
		 Unibail-Rodamco's Mr Cuvillier agrees. "Paris needs to be a great place to work and do business, not just a great tourist destination," he says. "A capital city that is attractive is a country that is attractive."

<titre>Brexit Briefing: The battle for London's business</titre>
<auteur>JAMES BLITZ</auteur>
<texte>
		The contest to snatch financial business from London after Britain's exit from the EU is getting hotter. Ireland threw its hat into the ring on Tuesday, saying it wanted Dublin to host the European Banking Authority, the regulator founded in 2011 and headquartered in London. 
		 Other EU cities hoping to benefit from Brexit include Frankfurt, Paris and to a lesser extent Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Munich, Madrid and Warsaw. "The welcome banner is hung out and Frankfurt's doors are wide open," says Hubertus Väth, managing director of Frankfurt Main Finance, a lobby group.
		In reality, most EU cities are a long way from joining the club of top-ranking financial centres. Consider the September edition of the Global Financial Centres Index, a closely followed annual study that is produced by two think-tanks, the Z/Yen Group in London and the China Development Institute in Shenzhen. 
		 According to the GFCI, the world's top five cities for financial business are London, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo. With global financial markets shifting their centre of gravity to Asia from western countries, five Chinese mainland cities as well as Taipei, Taiwan's capital, figure in the index's top 50 cities. 
		 However, US cities dominate the top 10. The list includes New York (second), San Francisco (sixth), Boston (seventh), Chicago (eighth) and Washington (10th). Other than London (first) and Zurich (ninth, but outside the EU), the only European cities in the top 20 are Luxembourg (12th) and Frankfurt (19th). Munich is 27th, Paris 29th, Dublin 31st, Amsterdam 33rd, Warsaw 45th and Madrid 68th. 
		 The reason seems clear. No city in the future EU-27 comes close to providing the scale and infrastructure required of a top-10 global financial centre. The European cities aspiring to absorb some of London's business are fairly small. No less important, their inhabitants enjoy a way of life that many do not wish to see disturbed by having their city transformed into a teeming, expensive financial hub. 
		 Dublin is one example. In a joke that alludes to London's Canary Wharf financial district, a docklands development in Dublin is labelled "Canary Dwarf". Dublin may snaffle the EBA from under the noses of Amsterdam or Paris, but the arrival of thousands of investment bankers, asset managers and insurers fleeing London after Brexit would place intolerable strain on the city's housing, education and other resources. 
		 Similar considerations apply to Frankfurt. Sometimes dubbed "Mainhattan" on account of its handful of skyscrapers, Frankfurt is, like most German cities, thoroughly provincial at heart. Although it hosts the European Central Bank and Germany's main commercial banks, Frankfurt has never been an investment banking centre. Neither the city's political classes nor the world's investment bankers show much enthusiasm for turning it into one. 
		 As for Paris, France's Socialist government has announced incentives, including tax breaks, to attract international business to the capital. The western outskirts of Paris already boast <mention id="1978">a Canary Wharf-like business district</mention> known as <mention id="1979">La Défense</mention>. 
		 However, France has a reputation for over-regulation, protectionism and cultural suspicion of capitalism and private wealth. Arguably, this is an exaggeration, but the grains of truth are numerous enough to limit the attractiveness of Paris as a global financial centre. 
		 None of this means that the City of London will hold on to all its business. Access to the EU market is crucial for London. But the obstacles to turning some other European city into a financial centre equivalent to London look, for the foreseeable future, insurmountable. 
		 Nissan's decision 
		The announcement by Nissan that it will build two new car models at its Sunderland plant is the big news of the day. It will be seen as a vote of confidence in the UK following the Brexit referendum and will boost hopes that other carmakers with investment decisions coming up will locate work in Britain.  
		 In Tuesday's Brexit Briefing, James Blitz looked at the pledges that Theresa May made to Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn to keep investing in the UK.  
		 Background reading 
		Brexit is set to rob international banks of the "passporting" rights (Bloomberg). Open Europe's report argues how the UK financial services sector can continue to thrive after Brexit 
		 How psychoanalysis can help us make sense of Brexit (LSE blog) 
		 Anne Perkins: The Goldman Sachs tape shows May is not leading on Brexit, but following (Guardian)

<titre>ENGIE welcomes French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy Segolene Royal to launch internal discussions on "Climate &amp; Energy".</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Nov 11, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- On Tuesday, November 10, ENGIE Chairman and CEO Gerard Mestrallet and Deputy CEO and Chief Operating Officer Isabelle Kocher welcomed Segolene Royal, French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, at <meronyme id="1984">ENGIE Group headquarters</meronyme> in <mention id="1985">Paris La Defense</mention> for the launch of internal discussions concerning "Climate &amp; Energy." 
		 Under the discussions, ENGIE employees will express their views on key points to be taken up at the annual Conference of the Parties (COP21) climate talk event to be held in Paris in just 20 days. The discussions will allow employees to develop informed opinions and weigh in on topics affecting the very future of our planet.
		These discussions are based on the original methodology of the "World Wide Views on Climate &amp; Energy" event, a global citizen consultation held in June 2015 involving thousands of people on five different continents. 
		 Segolene Royal has declared that "the voices of civil society are at the heart of the Paris Climate Conference on global climate to open in 20 days. Solutions against climate change are finally being considered opportunities: energy saving, waste repurposing, renewable energy and clean transportation. Businesses, citizens and regions, together, we will reconcile the economy with the ecology. I salute the audacity and visionary drive that ENGIE's top management have shown and encourage their employees to take part". 
		 In his opening remarks, Gerard Mestrallet stated: "We are proud to welcome Ms. Royal to launch with us these crucial debates concerning climate and energy. We firmly believe that COP21 will only be successful if we all do our part. Involving all 150,000 Group employees in discussions concerning the world energy transition was an obvious step for ENGIE because this issue is at the very heart of our businesses. We are anxious to hear what our employees have to say over the next ten days. It will be my pleasure to share their contributions at the COP21 climate talks." 
		 In order to further demonstrate ENGIE's commitment to combatting climate change, the Group has also decided to publish the reports required of it under the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act one year in advance. The reports will concern the financial risks associated with climate change for ENGIE, the impact on society and the environment, and measures taken to reduce CO2 emissions. 
		 Segolene Royal and Gerard Mestrallet also signed an agreement for the development of an "energy renovation passport." 
		 The energy renovation passport is an innovative mechanism designed to encourage households to renovate their homes to improve energy performance. The program targets high-energy-consuming homes. The passport consists of an in-depth energy audit accompanied by recommendations for renovations to increase energy efficiency, including cost estimates, expected savings, and possibilities for financial assistance. Households are expected to save a minimum of 35% on their energy bills 
		 This new agreement represents an expansion of the experimental efforts launched in January 2015 in the Communaute Urbaine d'Arras with the support of Ademe (the French Environment and Energy Management Agency). 
		 A thousand passports are expected to be signed by the end of 2017. The program is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, which aims for the renovation of 500,000 homes annually beginning in 2017. 
		 About ENGIE 
		 ENGIE develops its businesses (power, natural gas, energy services) around a model based on responsible growth to take on the major challenges of energy's transition to a low-carbon economy: access to sustainable energy, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, security of supply and the rational use of resources. The Group provides individuals, cities and businesses with highly efficient and innovative solutions largely based on its expertise in four key sectors: renewable energy, energy efficiency, liquefied natural gas and digital technology. ENGIE employs 152,900 people worldwide and achieved revenues of EUR 74.7 billion in 2014.

<titre>Education International affiliates celebrate Human Rights Day with Nobel Prize.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Dec 10, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Education International is the federation of organisations representing over 30 million teachers and other education workers, through over 400 member organisations in more than 170 countries and territories. 
		 The importance of trade unions in achieving human rights is evident for all to see today as the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to the Tunisian National Quartet, which includes five Education International affiliates.
		Taher Dhaker and Hussein Boujarra of the UGTT and cross regional committee http://www.ei-ie.org/kroppr/eikropped/Taher_Dhaker_Hussein_Boujarra _144967764814496776486776.jpg 
		 Under the United Nations' banner "Our Rights. Our Freedoms. Always," Human Rights Day is being recognised today around the world with a strong sense of optimism and hope. This optimism for the future is on full display in Oslo, Norway where the Tunisian National Quartet is being awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for its "decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011." 
		 "The recognition of the key role of human rights, asserted through social dialogue, in building democracy in Tunisia is not only a win for human rights, but highlights the importance of trade unions in asserting those rights and building just and sustainable societies," said Education International (EI) General Secretary Fred van Leeuwen in is Human Rights Day statement. "As we mark Human Rights Day, we pay tribute to those teachers around the world who have made the ultimate sacrifice to assert their rights and to those who continue to fight for their rights at work and for civil liberties." 
		 Included in the Quartet are five EI affiliate organisations. They are: the Federation generale de l'enseignement superieur et de la recherche scientifique (FGESRS), Syndicat general de l'enseignement de base (SGEB), Syndicat General de l'Enseignement Secondaire (SGES), Syndicat General des Inspecteurs de l'Enseignement Primaire (SGIEP), and the Syndicat National des Medecins, Dentistes et Pharmaciens Hospitalo Universitaires (SNMDPHU) are all members of the UGTT. 
		 "This award is the culmination of the UGTT historical path since its founding in 1946, where it participated in the national movement for independence and sacrificed with martyrs, also elaborated an economic and social program that helped building a modern country, which led to the development of social and human rights and restored social relationships and played a key role in the revolution of 2011, and contributed to protect Tunisia from the civil war," said Taher Dhaker, EI's Arab Countries Cross Regional Structure (ACCRS) Committee chair and a member of the SGEB, from Beirut. 
		 The Quartet is set to receive the Nobel Prize on behalf of four civil society organsiations, the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT, Union Generale Tunisienne du Travail), the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts (UTICA, Union Tunisienne de l'Industrie, du Commerce et de l'Artisanat), the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH, La Ligue Tunisienne pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme), and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers (Ordre National des Avocats de Tunisie).

		 ABSTRACT 
		 A partial replacement of the clinker by latent hydraulic or pozzolanic materials is encouraged due to environmental and specific technical requirements. Such substitution remains limited to a relatively low level (less than 30% by mass of cementitious materials). An experimental research work was carried out on mortars made with binary and ternary binders (Portland cement; metakaolin; limestone filler) to reach 45% total replacement. In order to investigate the activating effect of reduced water-to-cement ratio, two series of mixtures were designed with W/[C.sub.0] of 0.42 and 0.5. Their heat of hydration, portlandite content, shrinkage, porosity, and carbonation were monitored. The tests were performed to understand the evolution of their relative strength (activity index) and durability parameters. The strength development of mortars with ternary binders was found to depend on metakaolin properties, including manufacturing process and particle size distribution. Reducing W/[C.sub.0] ratio accelerated pozzolanic reaction and allowed improving early-age strength and durability parameters.

		 1. Introduction 
		 The use of alternative materials as a substitution to clinker is now a major issue to reduce C[O.sub.2] emissions from cement production [1-4]. In addition to conventional supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as silica fume, blast furnace slag, fly ash, etc. [5,92], the use of metakaolin (MK) appears today as a promising alternative to produce "eco-materials". Raw material, mainly kaolin-rich soil, is locally abundant, and the manufacturing process based on calcination at less than 1000[degrees]C consists in dehydroxylation without C[O.sub.2] emission, thus metakaolin presents a lower carbon footprint than Portland cement [6]. The replacement of MK and LF does not systematically reduce the emission of C[O.sub.2] and improve the durability of the related cement-based materials. The production of MK itself leads to lower C[O.sub.2] emissions than cement production; one ton of MK represents 175 kg of C[O.sub.2] released [7]. It also requires less thermal energy than clinker production. San Nicolas et al. [8] showed that a French installation consumes 2.2 MJ/t of MK, which is 80% less than the energy consumed during cement production. At the level of concrete, the C[O.sub.2] emissions and the cost-effectiveness of a ternary system [9] depend on the distance between the production plants. The C[O.sub.2] emissions should be compared at equivalent durability, thus it is necessary to assess the actual performances of these cement-based materials. 
		 Most of existing studies agree on the significant pozzolanic reactivity of metakaolin compared to other mineral additions [10,11]. Metakaolin is actually an artificial pozzolan, i.e. it can react with Portlandite (CH) from the cement hydration and form additional C-S-H or C-A-S-H [8]. This allows metakaolin to improve greatly the mechanical performance and durability of cementitious materials. 
		 Experimental studies of concrete or mortar incorporating metakaolin show that up to an optimum level of substitution, the compressive strength of these materials increases significantly (even at early age) compared to that of the reference concrete/mortar (without metakaolin) [12-17]. There is no consensus on the value of this optimum rate, probably because of the variability of MK and cement, mixture proportioning of concrete (W/C ratio, cement content, chemical admixtures, etc.). Nevertheless, all the works agree on the fact that this optimum is connected to the microstructure of the material which itself depends on three main factors: the filler effect, the acceleration of cement hydration (at very early age) and the pozzolanic reaction of the metakaolin with CH (significant at long-term) [12,15], It is generally located between 10 and 20% [14,16]. Below this threshold, the incorporation of the MK has been shown to produce finer pores and a segmentation of the capillary porosity [18,19]. The latter is at the origin of gas permeability and water absorption decrease in the concretes incorporating MK [20]. Therefore, these concretes showed better durability and resistance to aggressive agents [21-25]. 
		 The use of high MK content as partial replacement of Portland cement in mortar or concrete can lead to a significant drop in materials performances. One of the reasons is the depletion of portlandite produced by cement hydration. The Portland cement substitution rate p necessary to consume all the portlandite (CH) produced can be estimated by the following equation [26]: 
		 [mathematical expression not reproducible] (1) 
		 where n = C/S, M is the molar mass (g/mol), [beta] is the amorphous content of MK and a is the ratio between CH produced and A[S.sub.2] contained in MK. 
		 Through this equation, a rate of approximately 30% is obtained with n = 1.75, [beta] = 0.55, [alpha] = 3, %[C.sub.3]S = 65 and %[C.sub.2]S = 5.5. The studies carried out on binary mixtures (PC + MK) show that this value is an upper limit of the MK content that can be added in mortar without lowering its performance. Ambroise et al. [27] and Khatib et al. [28] actually showed that the compressive strength was lower than that of the reference mortar, with more than 30% of Portland cement replacement by MK. 
		 Recent work shows that it is possible to go beyond the 30% substitution of OPC, thus to decrease carbon footprint, by combining metakaolin with a moderate amount of limestone filler [29-31]. For instance, Antoni et al. [29] showed that ternary binders (PC + MK + LF) lead to higher performances than binary binders in terms of heat release and mechanical strength. However, these performances depend both on mix-design parameters (cement content, water-to-binder ratio, etc.) and on the physicochemical properties of the materials. 
		 It is important to note that data on the durability and long-term shrinkage of ternary binders incorporating limestone filler and metakaolin are very scarce in literature. Drying shrinkage remains a major issue for concrete durability. It has been widely investigated for binary binders, whereas only Barluenga et al. [32] and Brook et al. [21] focused on ternary binders (OPC + MK + Filler). Similarly, very few studies have been carried out on porosity [33], permeability [34] and carbonation [33] of these ternary binders. High substitution of Portland cement by mineral additions generally results in relatively low early-age strength, which is of major concern for durability due to hydration-drying coupling. The reduction of water-to-binder ratio allows optimizing the composition of these materials to meet specifications on early-age strength and durability [5,35]. There are a limited number of references on the influence of water-to-binder ratio on performances of metakaolin-based materials [36]. 
		 The paper investigates the feasibility of substituting 45% by mass of ordinary Portland cement by mineral additions while keeping or enhancing mechanical performances and durability. Three sets of mineral additions have been studied, namely: metakaolins, limestone fillers, and siliceous fillers. They were characterized by different chemical compositions, particle size distributions and specific surfaces. They were first used separately as a substitution of Portland cement, and siliceous filler and limestone filler were associated to metakaolin in order to understand the synergistic effect of these materials. Then, the influence of the quality of metakaolin (purity of kaolin and manufacturing process) on the relative strength was studied. Finally, the major originality of this work consists of an experimental study of the drying shrinkage, water porosity and carbonation of ternary binders (OPC + MK + Filler) and an investigation on the effect of water-to-binder ratio on these parameters. 
		 2. Experimental program 
		 The chemical compositions of metakaolin and limestone filler make it an interesting combination as a substitute for Portland cement. Their Si02 and CaO contents are complementary in order to make an effective mixture thereof as a substitute for the cement. The high crystallized silica content of the Siliceous Filler (SF) makes it valuable as an inert substituent, thus highlighting the possible chemical interaction of limestone filler on Portland cement and Metakaolin. 
		 The different stages of the study presented in this paper are summed up in Fig. 1. Metakaolin (MK), limestone filler (LF and [micro]LF) and siliceous filler (SF1 and SF2) were used as partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement (PC). In the first part, the effects of inert minerals additions and pozzolanic addition (MK) on cement hydration and compressive strength development are quantified by means of isothermal calorimetry, compressive tests and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). The tests were carried out both on binary and ternary binders' mixtures. The objectives were defined as follows. 
		 --The combination (PC + MK) allows highlighting the effects of MK on cement hydration. 
		 --The comparison between LF and SF in binary mixture allows demonstrating how the limestone fillers are likely to influence cement hydration. 
		 --(PC + MK + LF) and (PC + MK + SF) allow studying the impact of LF on pozzolanic reactions and its interaction with MK. 
		 --The comparison between LF/[micro]LF and SF1 /SF2 in binary and ternary mixtures shows the effect of fineness on the properties of the cementitious matrix. 
		 This analysis leads, in the second part, to the choice of the best combination (PC; MK; X = {LF, [micro]LF, SF1, SF2}), which can be used for the study of the influence of metakaolin quality on hydration and compressive strength. Finally, the metakaolin MK3 which exhibited the best mechanical performance was used to highlight the effect of water-to-binder ratio (noted W/[C.sub.0]) on durability properties of binary and ternary mixtures including MK. 
		 2.1. Materials 
		 The chemical compositions and physical properties of the ordinary Portland cement (PC), metakaolins (MK), limestone fillers (LF) and siliceous fillers (SF) are given in Table 1. Three metakaolins from two extraction areas, calcined according to two different processes were studied. MK1 was obtained by "flash" calcination [8] of kaolinic clay from Fumel (France). Its 53% reactive product content was given by the provider for the used sample. It was deduced from the determination on amorphous content from XRD analyses. MK2 and MK3 were obtained by calcining and micronizing kaolinic clay from the Charentes basin (France). XRD patterns of used metakaolins can be found in Ref. [37]. 
		 Two limestone fillers were used: LF from Orgon, France and [micro]LF from Arboc, Spain. The last one is much thinner. Similarly, two siliceous fillers were used in this study. The main difference between the two siliceous fillers (SF1 and SF2) is their particle size distribution: the proportion of particles passing 40 [micro]m was 86% for SF2 compared to 65% for SF1. 
		 2.2. Mixtures proportions and samples 
		 Twenty-three mortars were prepared. Table 2 gives the compositions of the first twenty mortars. All mixtures were designed with the same paste volume (530 L/[m.sup.3]) and the same sand content (1241 kg/[m.sup.3]). 
		 PC was considered as the reference mixture made with only OPC. Mixtures CXL were made with L% of X, where X= (MK1; MK2; MK3; LF; [micro]LF; SF1; SF2). Mixtures CXMYN were made with M % of X and N% of Y, where Y = {IF: [micro]LF; SF1; SF2}. L, M and N were expressed as the mass fraction of the mineral additions in the binders. The replacement ratios vary between 15% and 45%. The workability was measured using 15-cm high mini-cone. It was adjusted when necessary using TEMPO11 superplasticizer to reach slump of approximately 5 cm and ensure good compaction of samples. Adding limestone filler to metakaolin-cement mixtures improved their workability as its water demand was lower (Table 1) and the needed superplasticizer content was lower (Table 2). Recent studies have shown that this difficulty can be overcome by modifying the mixing process [33] or using chemical and mineral admixtures [36]. 
		 In order to study the gypsum effect on the activity index of ternary binders, three other mortars were designed. These samples were obtained by modifying the mortars mixtures with ternary binders [CMK1.sub.30][LF.sub.15]. Gypsum was added to this composition, substituting 1.5 - 3.27 - 7.12% of the binders (Table 3). 
		 2.3. Testing procedures 
		 2.3.1. Isothermal calorimetry and TCA 
		 Isothermal tests were conducted on mortar samples at 20[degrees]C as described in Lenormand et al. [38,39]. It allows continuous measurement of hydration heat and evaluation of the degree of hydration. The degree of hydration is assumed proportional to the heat flow q, generated from the cement hydration reaction. Thus, the time evolution of the hydration degree a(t) can be approximated by Eq. (2) [40]. 
		 [alpha](t) [approximately equal to] Q(t)/[Q.sub.tot] = [[integral].sup.t.sub.0] q ([tau])d[tau]/[Q.sub.tot] (2) 
		 where Q[t) is the cumulated heat (J/g-cement) at a given time t and [Q.sub.tot] is the ultimate cumulated heat. 
		 A graphical method was used for the estimation of ultimate cumulated heat [Q.sub.tot]. The cumulated heat was plotted as a function of 1/[square root of t]. A linear evolution is obtained for small values of 1 /[square root of t]. The intersection of this linear function with the y-axis gives an estimation of [Q.sub.tot]. 
		 Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a Netzsch STA 449 F3 Perseus device. The studied materials were dried at 80[degrees]C then crushed to obtain 200-mg samples. They were heated at 10[degrees]C/min from 25[degrees]C to 1200[degrees]C. Portlandite content was determined from mass curves according to the tangent Method [41]. 
		 2.3.2. Compressive strength and activity index 
		 Compressive test was performed on 4 x 4 x 8 [cm.sup.3] specimens at 1,2,7 and 28 days. The tests were carried out on three specimens and the average values were retained. Activity index of binary and ternary mixtures is the ratio between compressive strength of mortar with mineral addition ([f.sub.p]) and compressive strength of reference mortar ([f.sub.0]), as expressed in Eq. (3). 
		 I = [f.sub.p]/[f.sub.0] (3) 
		 where p is the mass percentage of mineral addition. 
		 2.3.3. Porosity 
		 According to the vacuum saturation method [42,43], the water porosity was measured on cylindrical samples of 110 mm of diameter and 50 mm of thickness. They were taken from samples stored in water at 20[degrees]C. The Eq. (4) was used to assess the porosity [44] at 28 days: 
		 P = [M.sub.sat] - [M.sub.dry]/ [M.sub.sat] - [M.sub.wat] x 100 (4) 
		 where [M.sub.sat] is the mass in air of saturated sample (g), [M.sub.dry] is the mass of oven-dried sample and [M.sub.wat] is the mass in water of saturated sample. The specimens were dried at 105[degrees]C until constant mass (mass variation lower than 0.1% within 24 h). 
		 2.3.4. Shrinkage 
		 The total shrinkage was measured with LVDT sensors on prismatic samples (20 x 20 x 160 [mm.sup.3]). These specimens were demolded after 1-day sealed curing and stored in climatic chamber under controlled conditions (20 [+ or -] 1[degrees]C and 50 [+ or -] 5% of RH). 
		 The total shrinkage magnitude after a given drying time cannot be considered as an intrinsic concrete characteristic as it depends on time and specimen size [45,46]. Extrapolation models can be used to determine two parameters: characteristic time and ultimate shrinkage. One of the most commonly used model is the hyperbolic form given by Eq. (5) [47-50]. 
		 [[epsilon].sub.dry] (t-[t.sub.0])/(t - [t.sub.0]) + [N.sub.s] [[epsilon].sub.[infinity]] (5) 
		 Where [[epsilon].sub.[infinity]] is the ultimate shrinkage ([micro]m/m) and Ns the shrinkage half time (days), determined from the experimental data by minimizing the mean square error. Many models exist in literature, but the hyperbolic form introduced by Hansen &amp; Mattock [49] and presented in Eq. (5) provides reliable results in a shorter time, as shown by Samouh et al. [46], For this model, the characteristic time is also called the shrinkage half-time as it corresponds to the time when the strain reaches half of the ultimate shrinkage. 
		 2.3.5. Carbonation 
		 The carbonation progress was measured on prismatic samples (40 x 40 x 160 [mm.sup.3]). After their preparation the specimens were sealed cured for one day then directly exposed to ambient C[O.sub.2] concentration (0,04%) in climatic chamber under controlled conditions (20 [+ or -] 1[degrees]C and 50 [+ or -] 5% of RH). Phenolphthalein is used as an indicator in acid-base titrations to assess the carbonated depth [51,35]. The Phenolphthalein solution is sprayed on cross sections and turns pink in basic area which represents the non-carbonated mortar. 
		 3. Results and discussions 
		 3.1. Influence of mineral additions 
		 3.1.1. Effect of mineral addition (W/[C.sub.0] = 0.5) 
		 Activity index of mortars with 30% replacement of metakaolin MK1 and four different fillers are given in Fig. 2 for 7 and 28 days. It can be observed that the replacement of Portland cement (PC) by any mineral addition of the study lead to a reduction of compressive strength compared to reference mortar (with PC only) both at 7 and 28 days. However, for the four fillers used, the relative compressive strengths were higher at 7 days than at 28 days. This can be explained by the nucleation process as it contributes to the increase and acceleration of cement hydration [52]. As illustrated in Fig. 4a which depicts heat flow versus time of binary blends, the hydration heat closely depends on cement content. Compared to reference mortar, the heat flow at the first peak actually increased with the incorporation of fillers. According to other studies [52-54], this increase due to nucleation process is a "physical effect" of filler on short-term hydration. As reported in Kadri et al. [54], the accelerating effect of fine particles disappears at advanced stages of hydration. Thus, at long-term only the degree of hydration of Portland cement becomes preponderant. At 28 days, neither the nature of the filler nor its fineness had any significant influence on the compressive strength of mortars (Fig. 2). The same conclusions are reported in Refs. [55,56] where the authors showed that the decrease in relative compressive strength at 28 days is mainly due to a dilution effect of the cement. 
		 The mortar with 30% replacement of MK1 had a better relative compressive strength at 28 days compared to the other binary mixtures (Fig. 2). This is due to the high chemical reactivity of metakaolin compared to the fillers. In the presence of Portlandite (CH) and water, metakaolin reacts to produce neoformed hydrated phases, CSH gel and alumina phases ([C.sub.2]AS[H.sub.8], [C.sub.4]A[H.sub.13] and [C.sub.3]A[H.sub.6]) [57,58] resulting in higher strength of mortar. However, in contrary to studies carried out by Khatib et al. [28] and Antoni et al. [29] where the mortar incorporating 30% of metakaolin had 120-130% of the reference mortar 28-day compressive strength, in this study the mortar reached only 74% of PC strength. Several reasons could explain this trend: 
		 --The properties of the cement [59,60]: the cement used here was CEM I 52.5, which resulted in relatively high strength of the reference. The strength class of the cement used in Antoni et al. [29] is not known. It contained 77.3% of ([C.sub.3]S + [C.sub.2]S) against 69.8% in the cement used in this study. This means that in MK1-blend cement mortar, there is probably less Portlandite produced and additional metakaolin would be present as inert phase in cementitious matrix. 
		 --The chemical composition of the metakaolin: MK1 contents 93.16% of (Si02 + A1203) against 97.53% in the study of Antoni et al. [29] for example. 
		 --The purity of metakaolin, which is directly related to the quality of the kaolin used: despite the use of the same manufacturing process (flash calcination), Antoni et al. [29] used a very high purity metakaolin whereas MK1 contains only 53% of reactive products. This suggests that there is a significant amount of crystalline silica which is likely to improve packing density but not chemical reactivity. Avet et al. [61] actually showed that compressive strength is a linear function of calcined kaolinite content. In their study 28-day strength decreased by nearly 30% as calcined kaolinite content was reduced by 50%. 
		 Using pure metakaolin is generally not a cost-effective solution today. Moreover the replacement of cement is not necessarily the optimal use of such high quality raw material. Its use in previous studies was mainly for research purposes. In this experimental study the authors chose three different metakaolins with different production process and kaolinite content. The [Al.sub.2][O.sub.3][(Si[O.sub.2]).sub.2] content of MK1 was only 53% and it was obtained from flash calcination thus with lower energy consumption than fluidized bed. 28-day results in Fig. 2 shows that the synergistic effect of the ternary system can be observed even at intermediate kaolinite content. Recent studies also showed the potential reactivity of other clays such as calcined material with approximately 40% kaolinite and 40% of other clay minerals [62], calcined smectitic clays [63], flash calcined smectite and illite [36]. 
		 Due to several phenomena, the optimal replacement rate of PC by metakaolin which helps to keep or improve the mechanical properties of mortar is very variable [14,16], As shown in Fig. 3a, the relative compressive strength of mortar with 30% of MK1 increased with time. The main reason is the progressive activation of the pozzolanic reaction of amorphous silica and alumina contained in the metakaolin [8,15,16,64]. 
		 The presence of metakaolin also increased significantly the first peak of heat flow (Fig. 4a). Moreover, the time corresponding to the appearance of the first peak was getting shorter compared to filler-blended cement mortar. This trend confirms that MK contributes to the increase of hydration rate at very early age. This behavior can be attributed to the combination of two effects: creation of nucleation sites which is much more pronounced with metakaolins due to high specific surface (Table 1), and chemical effect which consists to the stimulation of anhydrous particles of cement [65], The effect of the presence of MK in cementitious matrix is clearly illustrated by the intensity and position of the second peak. This peak has been interpreted by Lerch [66] as the "sulfate depletion peak", as it is clearly influenced by calcium sulfate content. Hesse et al. [67] actually showed that this heat flow maximum can be attributed to an acceleration of the aluminate reaction with the enhanced dissolution of [C.sub.3]A and the final formation of ettringite. This acceleration occurs as soon as the calcium sulfate phase is exhausted. After this hydration stage the sulfate concentration of the pore solution of the cement paste decreases and less [C.sub.3]A is present in the cement paste thus a conversion of ettringite to monosulfate should start [68]. The same observations were made by Lagier et al. [59]. They reported an increase of the height of the second peak with the specific surface area of metakaolin and the alkali content of cement. Both factors are likely to accelerate the dissolution of metakaolin and the increase in solubilized aluminum. Thus, an increase in metakaolin dissolution rate would promote the hydration of [C.sub.3]A, and the metakaolin reaction itself could contribute to the magnitude of the peak. 
		 This second peak was also present to a larger extent in the ternary mixtures (Fig. 4b), and appeared almost at the same time. However, in ternary mixtures (PC + MK1 + Filler), both nucleation and chemical effects could not offset the dilution effect due the high replacement rates of cement (45% by weight). Consequently, ternary binder mixtures just reached 65% of the reference mortar compressive strength (Figs. 2 and 3b). This compressive strength reduction was even more pronounced in ternary binders containing siliceous fillers than those containing limestone filler (Fig. 3b). The synergistic effect of metakaolin and limestone filler can clearly be seen on this graph, as the difference between activity indices of SF-based mixtures and LF-based mixtures kept increasing from 1 day to 7 days and allowed reaching higher strengths at 28 days. In spite of significant increase of specific area (Table 1), the replacement of limestone filler LF by [micro]LF did not result in an acceleration of hydration. However, for a given hydration degree, [micro]LF mixtures generally showed higher activity index, especially for binary binders and early-age values (Fig. 4a). This suggests that smaller [micro]LF particles (Table 1) improved the packing density of cement paste, which is an interesting behavior to optimize earlyage strength. 
		 In order to understand the evolution of binary and ternary binders hydration, the variation in portlandite content [DELTA]Ca[(OH).sub.2] was calculated as expressed in Eq. (6). [DELTA]Ca[(OH).sub.2] has been assessed to distinguish the pozzolanic or nucleation reactions effect from the dilution effect. When cement is replaced by metakaolin, the portlandite content actually varies due to lower cement content (dilution effect), and other hydration reactions which consume portlandite (pozzolanic effect) or enhance portlandite formation (nucleation effect). In Eq. (6), the second term represents the dilution. If [DELTA]Ca[(OH).sub.2] is negative, this means that only taking into account the dilution effect would lead to higher Portlandite content than that actually measured, thus pozzolanic reaction occurred (see [CMK1.sub.30] in Table 4). If [DELTA]Ca[(OH).sub.2] is positive, this means that only taking into account the dilution effect would lead to an underestimation of Portlandite content, thus nucleation has favored its formation (see [CSF1.sub.30] and [CSF2.sub.30]). Table 4 reports the results obtained for binary and ternary binders mixtures at 28 days. 
		 [DELTA]Ca[(OH).sub.2] = %Ca[(OH).sub.2](MA(p)) - %Ca[(OH).sub.2](PC) x (100% - p%) (6) 
		 where p is the mass percentage of mineral addition. 
		 Ternary binder mixtures showed a higher reduction in the amount of CH than binary binder mixtures, which was not only due to dilution effect. This shows that the combination (MK + Filler) has a positive impact on reactivity of MK. The combination (MK + LF/[micro]LF) exhibited a better consumption of Portlandite than siliceous filler combination. This can explain the lower reduction of compressive strength in systems (PC + MK1 + LF/[micro]LF), assuming that the consumption of CH leads to the formation of new hydration products which densify the cementitious matrix, as confirmed by Fig. 4b. 
		 The XRD patterns performed by Antoni et al. [29] on ternary binders incorporating 30% of MK and 15% of limestone filler actually showed a modification of the products formed. Their observation helps to confirm the positive effect of limestone on the development of mortar strength. A significant and increasing presence of ettringite (AFt) and hemicarboaluminate (He) as a function of age was actually noted. This significant quantity of hemicarboaluminate is explained by the chemical reaction between the calcium carbonate (from limestone filler) and the aluminate supplied by cement and metakaolin. This reaction requires the presence of portlandite [30,69,70], that is why CH consumption was higher in the ternary mixture (Table 4). The strength increases of the (PC + MK + LF/[micro]LF) mixtures was much lower after 28 days. This trend was also observed by Antoni et al. [29] and Vance et al. [30], It can be explained by nearly total depletion of portlandite at this age in these mortar mixtures (Table 4). 
		 Fig. 2 also shows that with equal replacement ratio, mortar containing 20% of MK1 and 10% of LF (replacement of 30% of Portland cement) developed better compressive strength than mortar containing 30% of MK1. Limestone filler is known to accelerate the hydration of [C.sub.3]S and thereby increase the early compressive strength of the mortar [71-73]. When limestone filler is combined with metakaolin, this effect is less clear, as showed by heat flow (Fig. 4) and activity index (Fig. 3) values. The higher specific area of MK seems to have a prevailing effect on cement hydration at early age. In addition to this phenomenon, some unreacted CaC[O.sub.3] can also improve the packing density of the mortar by filler effect. However, it is important to note that in spite of the same ratio CaC[O.sub.3]/A[S.sub.2] in mixtures [CMK1.sub.30][LF.sub.15] and [CMK1.sub.20][LF.sub.10]. this latter developed a greater activity index. This confirms that these mixtures are also influenced by dilution effect of the cement. 
		 The use of siliceous filler in ternary binders also induced highly exothermic reactions at very early age (Fig. 4) without enhancing mortar strength. Finally, (PC + MK1 + LF) system offered the best compromise in terms of reduction of C[O.sub.2] emission, relative strength, and heat flow. Despite the reduction of heat flow at the first peak in the system (PC + MK1 + LF), the results showed a higher peak intensity compared to that of reference mortar (Fig. 4). Similarly, despite the apparent acceleration of hydration, compressive strength of ternary binder mixtures remained very low at early age (Fig. 3). Knowing that the ternary mixtures contain less Portland cement, one of the factors that can explain this peak is the influence of [C.sub.3]A on hydration due to insufficient gypsum. Thus, it appeared useful to investigate the influence of adding extra gypsum on strength development of heat flow of system (PC + MK1 + LF). 
		 3.1.2. Effect of gypsum 
		 It is generally agreed that the effect of gypsum is to control the rapid reaction normally shown by the calcium aluminates. However, the mechanisms that govern the reaction between calcium sulfate and [C.sub.3]A are not well known. Some authors suggest there is a formation of protective and waterproof barrier around [C.sub.3]A which limit water and ions diffusion necessary for [C.sub.3]A precipitation [74,75], According to Feldman et al. [76], the slowdown of [C.sub.3]A hydration in the presence of gypsum would be due to the adsorption of sulfate ions on the surface of these particles. Fig. 5 illustrates the evolution of heat flow, registered as a function of time with different amounts of gypsum (0 - 1.5 - 3.27 and 7.12% by weight of binders). Note that these percentages do not include the initial amount of gypsum contained in Portland cement. 
		 The heat evolution rate curves show a slight increase of the first exothermic peak when the amount of gypsum increases. Nevertheless, for all mixtures tested, the differences in the intensity of the first peak were not significant. Similarly, this peak seems to appear at the same time. As shown in Fig. 5, fundamental effect of adding extra gypsum was seen at the second peak. Without adding extra gypsum to the ternary mixture, the second exothermic peak appeared earlier (11 h). As gypsum content increased, the intensity of the second peak decreased and it appeared later. Minard et al. [77] have highlighted that between the two peaks, the main reaction is governed by the dissolution of [C.sub.3]A and precipitation of ettringite. They also showed that the occurring of the second peak is due to depletion of gypsum. 
		 Fig. 6 illustrates the influence of extra gypsum on relative compressive strength at 1, 2, 7 and 28 days. At early age, with increasing of gypsum amount up to 1.5%, the compressive strength was improved between 5 and 20% compared to ternary binder without addition. This is consistent with the evolution of the cumulated heat of hydration over time. 
		 For large amounts of gypsum, the strength decreased compared to a mortar without additional gypsum addition. This can be partly explained by the dilution effect of gypsum [78]. As the mixtures were designed at constant binder content, the increase of gypsum content implies a decrease of [C.sub.3]S content thus less CSH formed in hydrated cement paste. The filling of the porosity by the hydration products is reduced, which affects the long-term compressive strength of mortars. Up to 1.5% of gypsum substitution, results presented in Figs. 5 and 6 show an enhancement of early compressive strength of ternary mixture system. However, when considering the mortar behavior at 7 and 28 days, it is observed that adding extra gypsum leads to significantly lower compressive strength. 
		 3.2. Influence of metakaolin properties 
		 In Fig. 7, the activity index of metakaolin mixtures is plotted at different ages: 1,2, 7 and 28 days. The three metakaolins have different origins, composition and microstructure (Table 1). It can be observed that depending on the type of metakaolin, the relative compressive strength significantly varied. 
		 For both series of mixtures (with binary and ternary binders), mortars containing MK3 developed higher compressive strength than mortars containing MK1, whatever their age. Similar results were reported by Cassagnabere et al. [79] for MK blended cements. This difference was attributed to the purity of metakaolin, which depends on the nature of the kaolin used. MK1 contained only 53% of reactive metakaolin for about 68% for MK3 [37]. The reactive products content was deduced from the determination on amorphous content from XRD analyses. 
		 At early age, compressive strength of the mixtures increased with the fineness of MK. With approximately the same chemical composition of both metakaolins, the compressive strength of MK3 was higher than that of MK2 blended cement mortar. These results suggest that during the first stages of hydration, pozzolanic reactivity has a weak influence on compressive strength. According to Wild et al. [15] and Kiattikimol et al. [80], who studied metakaolin and fly ash respectively, the increase of compressive strength at these stages is attributable to the filler effect. This filler effect consists in filling the space between cement particles and so leading to a better packing. Moreover, the smaller the particle size, the more they act as nucleation sites where the first hydration products can precipitate [81]. At 7 days, the finer MK3 metakaolin showed a greater strength-enhancing effect than MK2. In binary mixtures, the 7-day activity index increased from 0.62 for MK2 to 0.87 for MK3, i.e. an increase in compressive strength of 40%. In ternary mixtures, the activity index increased from 0.49 for MK2 to 0.85 for MK3, i.e. an increase in compressive strength of 73%. This can be attributed to the acceleration of pozzolanic reactivity as MK fineness increases. These results are in agreement with other studies on mineral additions [55]. 
		 At 28 days, the activity index strongly increased for MK2 and MK3 blended cement mortars. At this stage, their compressive strength was close to reference mortar, confirming that with better quality of MK, a replacement ratio of 30% can allow to achieve the same compressive strength as reference mortar. Contribution of pozzolanic reactivity in the development of this high strength is illustrated in Table 5 where the variation in portlandite content is reported. Compared to MK1 blended cement mortars, the two systems (PC + MK3) and (PC + MK3 + LF) showed significant reduction in CH content at 28 days. This is consistent with variations of MK pozzolanic indexes given in Table 1. It should also be noted that between 7 and 28 days, there was no sign of strength development in system (PC + MK3 + LF). The degree of hydration in this system only changed from 0.83 to 0.84. This indicates a very high acceleration of the pozzolanic reactivity between 2 and 7 days due to the fineness of the MK3. The hydration of this ternary binder seems to be limited by the depletion of portlandite, as shown by portlandite content at 28 days given in Table 5. 
		 3.3. Influence of W/[C.sub.0] ratio and durability 
		 3.3.1. Mechanical properties 
		 It is known that concrete strength is affected by the water-to-binder ratio (W/[C.sub.0]) and cement content. The lower the W/[C.sub.0] ratio, the higher the strength is. These results are well known [82] and models such as Feret's or Bolomey's equation can be used to optimize mix-design of cement-based materials as mineral additions show relatively low coefficient of activity at early age [5]. In the case of concretes or mortars containing pozzolanic addition such as metakaolin, very few studies have been carried out on the influence of W/[C.sub.0] on compressive strength. In this study, the effect of two initial W/[C.sub.0] (0.42 and 0.5) on the compressive strength of mortars including binary (70PC + 30MK3) and ternary (55PC + 30MK3 + 15LF) binders is discussed. Fig. 8 represents the activity index versus degree of hydration of these four mixtures. 
		 At 1 day, as expected, an increase in the activity index with lower W/[Csub.0] was observed, for both binary and ternary binders. This means that the development of the compressive strength of these mortars evolved in the same direction and approximately the same magnitude as the reference mortar. These results are consistent with previous studies on the influence of the water-to-binder ratio. This trend can be explained by better hydration of the cement (a increased) and a reduction of the capillary porosity as W/[C.sub.0] decreased. Moreover, theoretical hydration models [82-84] show that a water-to-cement ratio of 0.42 is high enough for a complete hydration of Portland cement. The difference of activity index expressed by Eq. (7) was higher for binary binders (10%) than for ternary binders (4%). This variation can be attributed to the dilution effect due to a high substitution of the cement in the mortar incorporating ternary binders. Nevertheless, at this age, the quantity of CH consumed (Fig. 9) indicates that in mixture with w/c = 0.42, the pozzolanic activity has already begun whereas in W/[C.sub.0] = 0.5 mixture, the chemical effect of metakaolin was less significant yet. 
		 [[DELTA].sub.i](p, t) = i(p, t, w/c = 0.42) - i(p, t, w/c = 0.5) (7) 
		 From 2 days [[DELTA].sub.i](p,t) decreased until becoming negative. This inversion of [[DELTA].sub.i] (p, t) evolution appeared at 2 days for binary binders and from 7 days for ternary binders. At 28 days, despite a similar degree of hydration for both W/[C.sub.0] ratios, the activity index significantly decreased for W/[C.sub.0] = 0.42. Several phenomena could explain these variations. Lower W/[C.sub.0] resulted in activation of MK at early age but for longer hydration time, there was not enough free water to allow pozzolanic reaction with CH. Consequently, the slowdown of CH consumption limited later strength development. In contrast, for W/[C.sub.0] = 0.5 mixtures, the pozzolanic activity was very slow (Fig. 9) at early age, whereas a higher CH consumption at 28 days illustrates a higher pozzolanic activity. This was made possible due to the availability of water in the cementitious matrix. 
		 3.3.2. Shrinkage 
		 As shrinkage magnitude at a given time can be misleading to compare materials performances [45], the drying shrinkage results were analyzed through the hyperbolic shrinkage model (Eq. (5)). The analysis of experimental data provides two parameters. The obtained ultimate drying shrinkage and the shrinkage half-time are presented in Table 6. 
		 For a given proportion of mineral addition, the higher the W/[C.sub.0] ratio, the higher the ultimate shrinkage was. This trend has been observed in previous studies [85,86]. It is due to opposite effects of different properties such as pore size distribution, total porosity, modulus of elasticity, creep, and water diffusion. Higher W/[C.sub.0] ratio results in coarser porosity, which theoretically induces lower capillary stresses according to Young-Laplace Equation (Eq. (8)). However the modulus of elasticity decreases and creep increases, which tends to induce higher shrinkage strain. Higher W/[C.sub.0] generally results in faster water diffusion thus higher evaporation and shrinkage rates, which was not observed here for PC and [CMK3.sub.15] mortars (Ns was higher for W/[C.sub.0] = 0.5) (Table 6). This could be due to couplings between self-desiccation and drying. The reduction of W/[Csub.0] ratio has actually been shown to accelerate hydration reactions during the first days (Figs. 8 and 9). The shrinkage halftimes were actually close to the characteristic times of self-desiccation, thus shrinkage rates could have been influenced by this phenomenon. The free water available to drying is lower and it decreases with the hydration evolution especially when the water-to-cement ratio is low [87]. Thus, a high proportion of the evaporable water evaporates at early stages and then the water becomes less and less available for drying. This variation of drying rate is likely to influence the rate of the drying shrinkage. 
		 For both studied water-to-binder ratios, the substitution of cement by additions provided in all studied cases a lower ultimate shrinkage. According to the Young-Laplace Eq. (8), this result can be explained by the higher internal pressure due to the lowest and finest porosity when only Portland cement is used (Table 6) [88]. 
		 [[sigma].sub.cap] = 2[sigma]/r cos [[alpha].sub.m] (8) 
		 where a is surface tension of gas-liquid interface ([sigma] = 72.75 [10.sup.-3] N. [m.sup.-1] for water), r is pore radius (m), and [[alpha].sub.m] is wetting angle (rad). 
		 In order to confirm this assumption, the drying shrinkage was plotted against mass-loss in Fig. 10. Two stages can be observed. The second stage seems to indicate a linear relationship between drying shrinkage and mass-loss [89]. The slope of this linear phase K can also be used to model long-term shrinkage of concrete structures. PC mortar showed the highest values (Table 6). The porous network of mortar containing only PC was finer that of mixtures with binary or ternary binder. This induced higher ultimate shrinkage due to higher capillary stresses, and slower drying shrinkage rate, as shown by Ns values. 
		 Concerning the water-to-binder ratio of 0.42, the ultimate drying shrinkage decreased with the mineral addition proportion. For the water-to-binder of 0.5, the same tendency was observed excepted for 45% substitution of cement. In this last case with a ternary binder, an increase in the ultimate shrinkage was observed compared to the [CMK3.sub.30] mixture with binary binder and the same MK content. The [CMK.sub.30] [LF.sub.15] mixture actually had the highest water-to-cement ratio. Even if all the mixtures had the same W/ [C.sub.0] ratio, the actual water-to-cement ratio is a major parameter when specimens are exposed to drying at one day. At this early age, the cement hydration can be slowed down or stopped by exposure to drying [39]. For the mixture with ternary binder and water-to-binder ratio of 0.5, the highest cement substitution and the highest water content generate a faster water loss whereas the elastic modulus was lower due to the higher porosity (Table 6). Thus, the generated strain was also higher. According to the Table 6 this mixture had the lowest shrinkage halftime, which means the fastest drying (1 day to develop 50% of the ultimate shrinkage). 
		 The shrinkage half-time decreased with the cement substitution proportion for both studied water binder ratios. This result can be explained by the lower proportion of hydration products and the higher porosity for the mixtures with the lower cement content. The moisture diffusion coefficient theoretically decreases with the cement content and likewise for the drying rate which is behind the drying shrinkage rate. For the mixtures with proportions of mineral addition equal or higher than 30%, the faster drying can be explained by the highest free water content and highest initial porosity. This is confirmed by the experimental values of K. This coefficient generally decreased with mineral addition content, which corresponds to a coarser porosity. This is consistent with a decrease in shrinkage halftime. 
		 3.3.3. Durability indicators 
		 Water porosity is one of main indicators used to characterize the durability of cementitious materials. In the range of waterto-binder ratios studied in this work (W/[C.sub.0]  0.3), global porosity increases with W/[C.sub.0]. All the other parameters being equal, it can be assumed that the porosity of the concrete is conditioned by that of the cementitious matrix. In this matrix, the gel pores associated to the hydration products are generally distinguished from the capillary pores. Furthermore, Powers et al. [84] assumed that the gel pores would be conditioned by the advancement of the degree of hydration whereas capillary pores would be attributed to evaporation of free water. On the one hand, water porosity is correlated to mechanical properties such as compressive strength. It is well known that an increase in the porosity of cementitious materials generally cause a decrease in their compressive strength [90,91]. On the other hand, porosity can be used as a durability indicator in performance-based specifications [92] and its value is often needed for modelling purposes [93]. 
		 Results presented in Table 6 show an increase in water porosity with W/[Csub.0] ratio, independently of the substitution rate. For a given W/Q, ratio, the water porosity increased by 11-16% for binary mixtures and up to 26% for ternary mixtures, considering the PC mixture as a reference. The same trends have been obtained by Bredy et al. [94] on metakaolin blended cement paste. This increase was explained by the agglomeration of unreacted metakaolin. For lower substitution rate of Portland cement, other authors have made the same observation [18,19]. However, inverse phenomena are observed in other studies. Ambroise et al. [23], Poon et al. [95] reported a decrease in total porosity for cement pastes incorporating metakaolin. These tests were carried out with a lower water-to-cement ratio (0.3). According to these studies, the main observations are that other physicochemical properties of addition, mix-design parameters such as cement and water contents, and w/c ratio have a strong effect on packing density and hydration process and consequently on the microstructure of the mortar. 
		 The increase in water porosity with the cement replacement rate led to an increase in the natural carbonation depth of studied mixtures (Fig. 11). Carbon dioxide actually penetrates into cementitious materials through its open porosity then reacts with CH and CSH, which causes a drop in pH. The lower the porosity and the smaller the pore size, the slower the diffusion and C[O.sub.2] ingress and the lower the carbonation depth is at a given exposure time. Both factors (porosity and CH content) explain why ternary mixtures carbonate more compared to the reference mortar [16,96-98]. However, it can be noted that lower W/[C.sub.0] ratio reduce the carbonation depth, confirming that this mix-design parameter can be used to mitigate the carbonation of concretes incorporating metakaolin. The dilution effect is also an important parameter in the carbonation phenomenon. For mortars including up to 15% of metakaolin in substitution of Portland cement, Mota et al. [99] observed an increase in the carbonation depth despite an improvement in the mechanical performance of these mortars. However, the same tests carried out by adding metakaolin (instead of replacing it with cement) showed an improvement in both mechanical performance and resistance to carbonation. This fundamental difference is due to the lack of CH (consumed by the pozzolanic reaction with MK) to control the pH and avoid the acidification of mortars. 
		 Carbonation depth at 28 days was found to correlate with 1 -day compressive strength (Fig. 11). The mortar specimens were exposed to drying and carbonation at 1 day. At this age cementitious materials are mainly unreacted as hydration of cement as well as pozzolanic reactions require water. As drying starts, free water, which was meant to react with cementitious materials at later ages, evaporates and coarser capillary porosity is produced. Reducing the W/[C.sub.0] ratio allowed increasing the 1-day hydration degree (Figs. 8 and 9), thus mitigating carbonation. Pozzolanic reaction is actually known to induce finer porosity [38] thus lower C[O.sub.2] diffusion coefficient. 
		 In order to better understand the processes leading to concrete carbonation, mathematical model was developed by Papadakis et al. [97] for one-dimensional geometry, the carbonation depth [x.sub.c] (m) is given by the following analytic expression: 
		 [mathematical expression not reproducible] (9) 
		 where [C[O.sub.2]]0 is the molar concentration of C[O.sub.2] per unit volume of the gas phase, [[CaO].sub.0] is the total molar concentration of CaO and [D.sub.e]. C[O.sub.2] is the effective diffusivity of C[O.sub.2] in carbonated concrete ([m.sup.2]/s) which is expressed by [96]: 
		 [mathematical expression not reproducible] (10) 
		 Where [f.sub.c] is the compressive strength of the concrete (MPa). 
		 Results are presented in Table 7 for mortar with binary or ternary binder. Predicting values are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data when effective diffusivity is calculated with [f.sub.c7d] (compressive strength at 7 days). 
		 For a given W/[C.sub.0] ratio, the effective diffusion of C[O.sub.2] was significantly higher for mortars with more than 30% of PC replacement, confirming that the porous network of these mortars was coarser. The reduction of W/[C.sub.0] ratio from 0.50 to 0.42 allowed reaching the 7-day strength of reference mortar with W/[C.sub.0] = 0.50 thus reducing the C[O.sub.2] diffusion coefficient (Table 7). Despite equivalent [D.sub.e,CO2], [CMK.sub.30]-0.42 and [CMK.sub.30][LF.sub.15]-0.42 mixtures showed higher carbonated depth than reference mortar mixture due to lower CaO content. The carbonated depth of CMK30-0.50 and [CMK.sub.30][LF.sub.15]-0.50 mixtures was slightly underestimated. If CaO content is assumed to be well known, this could come from an underestimation of C[O.sub.2] diffusion coefficient. These two mixtures were actually found very sensitive to hydration-drying coupling as shown on Fig. 10. They actually showed significant water loss without shrinkage. This first stage can be observed when cement-based materials are exposed to drying at early-age. This is due to the formation of drying depth [42] where permeability is higher due to microcracking, wall effect, and coarser porosity as hydration has been nearly stopped by early drying. As 7-day compressive strength has been used to assess C[O.sub.2] diffusion coefficient, the obtained values do not take into account this strong early-drying effect for mixtures with relatively high w/c ratio. 
		 4. Conclusions 
		 The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of ternary binders based on metakaolin and limestone filler. The experimental study showed that the combination of both mineral additions and Portland cement is a promising alternative to current plain and blended Portland cements, not only in terms of strength but also for the potential durability. Experimental results on hydration obtained by using TGA and isothermal calorimetry are presented in this paper and correlated with compressive strength data. Shrinkage and durability parameters of binary and ternary binders mixtures are also analyzed. The following conclusions can be drawn: 
		 (a) Equivalent strength of metakaolin-based binary mixtures can be ensured provided that the replacement of Portland cement by metakaolin does not exceed 30% and that highly reactive metakaolin is used. However, there is evidence that higher substitution of Portland cement is possible by combining metakaolin with limestone filler. The presence of both additions in cementitious systems fosters primary and secondary hydration reactions and improves the packing density of cement paste. The extent of the pozzolanic reaction with metakaolin is enhanced. The performance of metakaolin-based binary or ternary mixtures was found to depend on metakaolin properties. These include the proportion of reactive phase as well as manufacturing process, specific area, and particle size distribution. 
		 (b) The presence of metakaolin influences cement hydration from very early age, as highly exothermic reactions were observed in binary and ternary binders, then a drop of heat flow. The results show that incorporation of additional gypsum in the binder allows a better control of aluminates related reactions. Consequently, heat flow and second peak of hydration are reduced. However, whatever the gypsum content, this beneficial effect is accompanied by a drop in mechanical performance at later ages. Thus, it is recommended to keep only the gypsum initially present in the Portland cement. 
		 (c) A decrease in W/[C.sub.0] ratio resulted in an increase in the activity index of blended cement mortars at early age. This was due to an accelerated pozzolanic reaction. At longer term, at lower W/[C.sub.0] ratio, the relative compressive strength decreased. A possible explanation is a slowdown of the pozzolanic reaction caused by rapid depletion of available water. 
		 (d) All the metakaolin-based mixtures showed lower ultimate shrinkage than reference mortar with plain Portland cement, but higher shrinkage rate. The analysis of shrinkage versus mass-loss curves actually showed that the replacement of cement by metakaolin and/or limestone filler produced coarser porosity. At W/[C.sub.0] = 0.50, the binary and ternary mixtures with 30% metakaolin proportions were highly sensitive to early drying, as confirmed by carbonation data. 
		 (e) For a given W/[C.sub.0] ratio, the cement replacement by metakaolin or metakaolin + limestone filler led to an increase in total water porosity, coarser porosity, and an increase in the natural carbonation depth. This trend can be explained by two compounded effects. Faster C[O.sub.2] diffusion in the mortars and limited content of carbonatable materials in blended cement mortar accelerated carbonation. Moreover, it can be noted that for a given replacement rate, lower W/[C.sub.0] ratio allowed reducing the carbonation depth, confirming that this mix-design parameter can be used to mitigate the carbonation of concretes incorporating metakaolin.

<titre>Mali: The hearing of Abou Tourab before the ICC is a victory, but charges must be expanded.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Sep 30, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- FIDH, AMDH and 16 other human rights organisations in Mali applaud the swift transfer of Ahmad Al Mahdi Al Faqi to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague from Niger on 26 September 2015. His status conference hearing took place this morning. Ahmad Al Mahdi Al Faqi, alias Abou Tourab, Chief of the Islamic Police in Timbuktu during the occupation by AQMI and Ancar Dine, faces charges of war crimes at the ICC for the destruction of cultural sites in Timbuktu in 2012. Our organisations, after having conducted field missions in Northern Mali, filed a criminal complaint before the national justice system last March against him and 14 other suspects of serious international crimes committed in Timbuktu. Based on information in our filing, we insist that the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) further consider credible allegations of Mr. Faqi's criminal responsibility for additional international crimes committed against civilians, including rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage.
		"Destruction of historic and religious sites is a serious affront to humanity, as it impacts our common heritage. However, a focus solely on cultural damage should not overshadow horrific violence against individuals, especially when both types of crimes were perpetrated simultaneously by the same people," underscored our organisations. "For the victims of these crimes, Abou Tourab and other responsible members of Aqmir and Ancar Dine must be prosecuted for the horrendous violence they have inflicted on populations in Timbuktu and Northern Mali. In the absence of substantive progress before the Malian justice system, investigation and prosecution of these crimes lies with the ICC". 
		 In the past, the ICC has been criticised for too-narrow charging, leaving many victims, particularly victims of sexual and gender-based crimes, without access to justice or reparation. However, with the Office of the Prosecutor's new Policy on Sexual and Gender-based Crimes, more inclusive and representative charges have been brought in recent cases. A return to a more limited approach to charging only one crime against Al Faqi, who is allegedly responsible for a much wider spectrum of atrocities, would be a step in the wrong direction and would contribute to excluding many victims from participating in the legal process. 
		 On 6 March, and following investigative missions in Timbuktu to interview numerous victims of jihadist armed groups, our organisations filed a complaint on behalf of 33 victims of crimes committed in Timbuktu before the High Court of the Commune 3 of Bamako. The complaint accuses Al Faqi and 14 others of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including sexual and gender-based crimes. The victims denounced abuses committed by the Islamic Police, and in particular the "Brigade des Moeurs", which was led by Abu Tourab in the early days of the occupation of Timbuktu. Crimes denounced include torture, arbitrary detentions, rape, forced marriage, sexual slavery and other sexual violence. 
		 Our organisations regret that the national investigation has not yet made any substantive progress, and recall that it is imperative for national authorities to respect Article 46 of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in Mali, which was negotiated through the Alger Initiatives and signed by all parties on 15 May and 20 June 2015. This agreement excludes all impunity for those responsible for international crimes. 
		 Background: 
		 In January 2012, Mali faced a Tuareg armed rebellion in the north of the country. The National Liberation Movement of Azawad (MNLA) quickly launched an offensive, which was opportunely joined by Islamist groups present in the Sahel band (Ansar Dine, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Movement for Oneness Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), and Boko Haram). Hostilities were conducted in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. The main northern cities fell into the hands of armed groups from early April 2012 until January 2013 at which point French Malian troops intervened. 
		 Mali ratified the ICC Statute on 16 August 2000. It referred the situation to the ICC Prosecutor on 13 July 2012. On 16 January 2013, the OTP formally opened an investigation into possible crimes within its jurisdiction committed in Mali. On 13 February 2013, the Malian government and the ICC signed a cooperation agreement in accordance with Section IX of the Rome Statute. The Pre-Trial Chamber issued the first arrest warrant under seal in the Mali situation against Mr. Faqi on 18 September 2015. One week later, Mr. Faqi, who was in custody of Niger authorities, was transferred to the ICC. 
		 The ICC has thus far charged Mr. Faqi with the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against religious and historical buildings in Timbuktu, as a member of the armed extremist group Ansar Eddine, affiliated with Al Qaeda. He is suspected of destroying 10 historic buildings, including multiple mausoleums and a mosque. The entire city of Timbuktu is considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 
		 According to our investigations conducted in January and February 2015, Ahmad Al Mahdi Al Faqi alias Abu Tourab, a native of the region of Timbuktu, was a member of Ansar Dine, a Malian armed jihadist group linked to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). As head of the Islamic Police, he was one of the four commanders of Ansar Dine responsible for the brutal imposition of power of jihadist armed groups in Timbuktu. At the head of the Islamic Police, he also endorsed the actions of the "Centre for the implementation of the suitable and prohibition of the blameworthy" (Centre d'application du convenable et de l'interdiction du bl'mable ) of the "Manners' Brigade" of the Islamic Police. Elements of this group have persecuted women, imprisoning them, and subjecting them to forced marriages. Abu Tourab also sanctioned rape and sexual slavery, directly and by his subordinates. Evidence we have collected also shows him in the process of leading and participating in the destruction of the mausoleums of saints and other Islamic cultural property of great value. After leading the Islamic Police in Timbuktu, he likely left to fight against the French and Malian armed forces in Konna in January 2013 before retreating to northern Mali and crossing into Niger where he was arrested by French forces and handed over to Nigerian authorities.

<titre>We will remember them - 8,000 tickets available for public to commemorate the Battle of the Somme Centenary.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jul 01, 2015 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The public will be invited to the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July 2016 to mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme, the Culture Secretary John Whittingdale announced today. 
		 The joint Anglo-French commemoration of the Battle of the Somme is expected to attract great public interest, so tickets will be made available for the event. The 8,000 tickets will be allocated in pairs, free of charge, through a public online ballot. The ballot will be open to residents of the UK, France and Ireland on 28 September 2015. More details can be found on the Somme 2016 Ballot website at www.Somme2016.org
		The Somme was one of the bloodiest battles of the First World War, resulting in over one million casualties. A commemorative event is held at the Thiepval Memorial every year, but the centenary event in 2016 will be on a larger scale, with some 10,000 people attending. 
		 Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said: 
		 The tragic events at the Battle of the Somme left a deep mark on a huge scale - nearly everyone in the UK will have an ancestor who fought or died at the Somme. It's important that people across the UK have the chance to remember and honour these brave soldiers. 
		 The centenary event will be an opportunity to not only pay tribute to those that sacrificed so much but to ensure that their legacy continues for generations. I am grateful to our French partners for working with us to commemorate the extensive loss on all sides on what will be an incredibly important and deeply moving event. 
		 The event will include representatives from the battle's combatant nations, organisations such as The Royal British Legion, and members of the public. Plans are being made to broadcast the ceremony live to large screens in towns across the Somme region and the UK. There will also be a wide programme of events taking place in the UK. Events will also take place in France to mark the 141 days of the battle. 
		 The Culture Secretary also announced a further GBP4 million in National Lottery funding through the Heritage Lottery Fund's First World War: then and now programme so communities can explore, conserve and share local heritage of the entire First World War. This new money will help even more people get involved and explore the inspirational stories of the conflict including those surrounding the Battle of the Somme. 
		 Monsieur Jean-Marc Todeschini, Secretaire d'Etat aupres du ministre de la Defense, en charge des Anciens combattants et de la Memoire said: 
		 In 2014, France entered the centenary of the Great War, a time of shared remembrance. A hundred years ago, our country was a global battlefield to which the Commonwealth nations, in a rush of comradeship, sent hundreds of thousands of their children. A hundred years later, the Somme is still exposing its scars, left by the bitter fighting between 1916 and 1918, and its places of remembrance that bear witness to France's gratitude to the British soldiers who sacrificed their lives for her. Yesterday a land of suffering, today a land of shared remembrance, Thiepval, on 1 July 2016, will see a new expression of the friendship between France and Britain. 
		 Commonwealth War Graves Commission Director of External Relations Colin Kerr said: 
		 For nearly a century the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Thiepval Memorial has stood as a silent witness to the sacrifice of those who died on the Somme in the First World War. There is no more fitting place to mark the anniversary of the battle, the human cost of which was felt in communities all over the world. The Commission is pleased to support our partners in the UK and French government for an inclusive commemoration - one that will capture the imagination of all generations and communities; one that allows them to pay respect, to visit, to be moved and to learn. 
		 Vice Admiral Peter Wilkinson CB CVO, National President of The Royal British Legion, said: 
		 The Royal British Legion organises a Service of Commemoration each year at Thiepval Memorial to remember all those who fought and died in the Battle of the Somme. It is a great honour to be part of a much larger event in 2016 to mark the 100th anniversary of what was one of the most ferocious battles of the First World War. The contemporaries of those that made the ultimate sacrifice in the Battle of the Somme are no longer with us. Now the torch of remembrance has passed to a younger generation. The public support for the First World War centenary commemorations to date has been overwhelming and has demonstrated that there will always be a living legacy to those who gave their lives for the freedom we have today. Notes to Editors 
		 The Thiepval Memorial was built and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is the largest Commonwealth war memorial in the world and bears the names of more than 72,000 men who died in the Somme sector and who have no known grave. The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and was unveiled on 1 August 1932 by Edward, Prince of Wales. Thiepval is both a memorial to the missing and a monument commemorating the alliance between the British Empire and France. Beside the memorial is a cemetery with equal numbers of Commonwealth and French graves, brought together from all over the battlefield. 
		 There will be a wide programme of events taking place in the UK and France to mark the centenary period, for which more information will be available in due course. 
		 Information on the registration and entry process will be announced in September. 
		 More details of visiting the region over the next year can be found on the Somme Department website

<titre>Paris wins battle to host European banking regulator</titre>
<auteur>JIM BRUNSDEN</auteur>
<texte>
		Paris and Amsterdam have been chosen as the new homes for two prized EU agencies, after ministers in Brussels resorted to picking names from a hat to decide where the two organisations and combined 1,000 staff should move after Brexit. 
		 Three rounds of voting in Brussels failed to produce a clear winner in the contests to relocate the European Banking Authority and the far larger European Medicines Agency, which are both currently based in London.
		Amsterdam tied with Milan in the final-round vote for the EMA, which 16 countries had sought to win, while Paris pipped Dublin after lots were drawn in the race for the EBA. "You could not make it up if you tried," said one EU diplomat.  
		 The EBA decision is a big victory for French president Emmanuel Macron, who is looking to push Paris as the EU's premier financial centre after Brexit. Mr Macron quickly tweeted his delight at the EU decision: "It is the recognition of the attractiveness and European engagement of France. Happy and proud for our country." 
		 The result means the French capital will now play host to both of the EU authorities responsible for setting banking standards, as well as the European Securities and Markets Authority, the agency in charge of regulating financial trading. 
		 "Paris is a surprise. We always had the impression that Frankfurt or Vienna were the most likely to win," said one senior insider. 
		 Vienna had offered the most generous financial package to secure the EBA, including a 25-year rent-free deal. Vienna had also come top in an internal staff survey, EBA insiders said, though Paris ranked second, suggesting relief among the workforce. 
		 Paris put one of the least generous packages on the table, offering a€1.5m one-off payment into the EBA coffers. The city has identified an office in <mention id="1994">La Défense</mention> and another in central Paris as possible locations. 
		 The EBA has yet to be told of a definitive move date but it is working on the basis that staff transfers will begin by the March 2019 Brexit date with the rest completed by the summer. 
		 Insiders said that although relief would be felt at the selection of Paris, many staff remained saddened by the relocation process. "This is nailing down the fact that Brexit is happening," said an executive. "It's very sad." 
		 The choices made by the EU27 foreign ministers in Brussels mark one of the first tangible steps the bloc has taken so far to prepare for Brexit. The EMA, with more than 900 staff, is seen as one of the biggest prizes in the EU's network of more than 40 agencies, which are scattered across the continent. 
		 The two decisions were the culmination of months of ferocious lobbying. Frontrunners jostled behind the scenes for votes, making promises to other countries ranging from future help in securing EU jobs to supporting more military assistance on the Russian border and participation in migrant patrols on the Mediterranean Sea. 
		 Under a complex, multi-round process, ministers began by each assigning a three-point vote, a two-point vote and a one-point vote to different candidates, with the three best performing cities then advancing to the next round. 
		 For the EMA, the system was used to whittle the 16-strong field to three - Milan, Amsterdam and Copenhagen - then to a head-to-head between the Dutch and Italian cities.  
		 After the pair tied for support with 13 votes each in the final round, it fell to the minister from Estonia, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, to reach into a large bowl and pick the winner. 
		 The biggest shock of the first round of EMA voting was the elimination of Bratislava, which had been viewed as a frontrunner, not least because central and eastern Europe are under-represented when it comes to EU agencies. The Slovak capital finished in fourth place with 15 points, behind Milan on 25 and Amsterdam and Copenhagen on 20.  
		 Slovakia abstained from voting in the second and third rounds in protest at the lack of a smaller member state in the contest. "This decision is strictly political and we expected that at least one member state from the region would go after the first round to the second round," said Tomas Drucker, Slovakia's health minister.  
		 "I think it's not fair. It's not a good message for Europe's inhabitants," he added.  
		 According to an EMA internal staff survey, more than 70 per cent of its staff would have left had the agency moved to Bratislava. The predicted staff retention rates for Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Milan were all far higher.  
		 For the EBA, Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin emerged as the frontrunners from the first round of voting, with the German city then eliminated in the second round. One country spoiled its ballot in the final round, producing a tie. 
		 Guido Rasi, the EMA's executive director, said Amsterdam "ticks many of our boxes". It offered "excellent connectivity and a building that can be shaped according to our needs".

<titre><meronyme id="1995">Areva headquarters</meronyme> raided by French prosecutors</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE</auteur>
<texte>
		French prosecutors raided <meronyme id="1996">the offices of state owned nuclear group Areva</meronyme> on Tuesday. 
		 A spokesperson for Areva confirmed the raid had taken place at <meronyme id="1997">the company's headquarters</meronyme> in <mention id="1998">the business district of La Defense</mention> in Paris. 
		 The PNF, the national financial prosecutor's office, did not confirm the reason for the search.
		One source close the PNF said it was not related to an ill-fated acquisition of a number of African uranium mines. 
		 That acquisition saw the former chief executive of Areva placed under formal investigation in 2016 over whether she deliberately submitted misleading annual accounts that concealed huge writedowns on the company's€1.8bn investment in Uramin in 2007. 
		 Areva's uranium trading activity also has come under scrutiny in recent months. In March this year, the Niger parliament began investigating a circuitous uranium trading deal that involved the Niger state-run mining company Sopamin, 5.5m pounds of uranium, Areva and two companies unknown in uranium trading circles. 
		 Dubbed "Uraniumgate" by the Nigerean press, the probe sought to ascertain whether Niger officials had embezzled public funds, using the mysterious transaction as a cover. The probe found no wrongdoing by officials in Niger, though the opposition says the report is botched. 
		 Areva is being completely restructured and recapitalised in a government backed deal after years of losses wiped out its equity and brought it to the brink of collapse. Its troubled reactor business is being taken over by EDF, the larger French nuclear group.

<titre>Paris's passion for Japanese architecture</titre>
<auteur>EDWIN HEATHCOTE</auteur>
<texte>
		Roland Barthes, while wandering the streets of Tokyo in 1966, noticed the Japanese culture of gift boxes. "Geometric, rigorously drawn," he wrote, "and yet always signed somewhere with an asymmetrical fold or knot, by the care, the very technique of its making, the interplay of cardboard, wood, paper, ribbon, it is no longer the temporary accessory of the object to be transported, but itself becomes an object; the envelope, in itself, is consecrated as a precious though gratuitous thing; the package is a thought." 
		 In  Empire of Signs  Barthes compared the tradition of Japanese packaging to architecture, in which what is important is the wrapping, often delicate but at the heart of which is empty space. He implicitly compared this to Tokyo itself, a complex, super-dense city with a void at its centre, the inaccessible imperial palace, the house of a man who is never seen. 
		As an intellectual culture often more engaged with the sign than the signified, modern France has fetishised the minimal aesthetic culture of Japan, perhaps as an antidote to the rich, gilded rococo of its own built fabric. From the Impressionists through to Jacques Roubaud, Chris Marker, Michel Foucault and even Jacques Chirac, Paris has been gently marinated in Japanophilia. There had been successful Japanese national pavilions but the first permanent (and very visible) signs of this fascination on the skyline came during a wave of construction in <mention id="1999">the La Défense business district</mention> in the late 1980s, notably Kisho Kurokawa's Pacific Tower with its Zen-ish rooftop garden (1992) and Kenzo Tange's curious Grand Ecran complex (1991). Then, in 1995, came Tadao Ando's striking meditation cylinder at the Unesco building, with its hovering disc of a ceiling. 
		 And now Ando is back with another concrete cylinder. The conversion of the city's central Bourse de Commerce into a public gallery for the luxury goods magnate François Pinault is the latest surge in a sudden flood of Japanese architecture in the French capital.  
		 Last year Shigeru Ban completed La Seine Musicale concert hall on the Île Seguin. With its death-star dome and dramatic concrete interiors, this is very much a building in the city's tradition of  grands projets . Ban's previous Parisian building, the delicate, translucent extension to the Musée du Luxembourg (completed 2011), was very different, featuring his characteristic use of cardboard tubes as a construction material.  
		 Meanwhile Kengo Kuma, having built the Pôle multi-équipements Macdonald, an impressive mixed-use college and sports centre, in 2011 is now at work on the huge Aurore scheme. A combined "eco-luxury hotel", performance space, offices, hostel and co-working space above the railway tracks at the Gare d'Austerlitz, it is scheduled for completion in 2022. In the renderings, it looks like a kind of bamboo-framed jungle, its hanging gardens and timber terraces having more of Bali in them than Rive Gauche. But it will certainly make an impact, as will Kuma's other major project in the city, an elegant-looking transparent and terraced building for the Grand Paris Express, the Gare Saint-Denis Pleyel (due 2023). 
		 Amid all this activity, the building that is making the most waves is Sou Fujimoto's Milles Arbres, a floppy pancake that straddles the Périphérique in the Pershing district. It will be, as its name suggests, crowned by a thousand trees, but it will also include a village of translucent houses amid the greenery. Fujimoto is also designing the delicate glazed and faceted École Polytechnique at the Université Paris-Saclay campus.  
		 And then, after all that, there's SANAA. The practice formed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa was arguably responsible for sparking this new explosion of Japanese architecture with their ethereal Louvre in Lens (2012), which has turned out to be one of the most memorable museums of the modern age. From its inception as a published design, its almost disappearing architecture generated a particular excitement in France, a renewed passion for the minimal Japanese aesthetic.  
		 It has proved difficult, however, to translate that architecture into Paris's fiercely protected streetscapes, and SANAA has been working on the rebuilding of the city's La Samaritaine department store for what seems an eternity. Originally scheduled to open in 2013, the design has faced opposition at every stage, with conservationists seemingly determined to put a stop to the arrival of contemporary architecture in the very centre of the city.  
		 Yet the design is hardly the kind of aggressive intervention that might be expected to raise hackles. What looks like a delicate net curtain is drawn around the structure, and its curving folds subtly echo the rhythm of the neighbouring building's structural grid. From the renderings at least, it appears to be a lovely thing.  
		 But perhaps the problems encountered in the construction of this building highlight precisely the differences between SANAA's home city of Tokyo and Paris - differences that help explain the yearning of the latter for the former. For Tokyo is everything Paris is not. Its architecture is unruly and unregulated, it is high-tech and highly illuminated, a sci-fi city of filmic intensity and churning change. It is a city of fleeting images rather than permanent physical fabric.  
		 Paris, on the other hand, has long been stuck in its own perfection, bound by strict codes that govern appearance, dimensions and materials. Its architects dream of Tokyo's freedom and easy-going attitude to the existing physical fabric. They yearn for an architecture of disappearance rather than solidity. Just as Barthes was seduced by a city of mysterious codes, contemporary Parisians have been attracted to a culture of ethereality.  
		 You might think that, in an era of globalised architecture, there is nothing unusual about a European capital boasting so many buildings by Japanese architects. But then you might look over the Channel to another capital, one that has always proclaimed itself to be more open to international influence and more welcoming of change - London - and find not a single work by a Japanese architect. In fact the only work I can think of that would qualify in the whole of the UK is a wall built by Tadao Ando in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens which is about to be demolished. 
		 It's possible that the waters of this architectural deluge might be receding. Not all recent designs have been universally welcomed - as witness SANAA's Samaritaine difficulties - while Shigeru Ban's Metz outpost of the Pompidou (which last year hosted an exhibition of Japanese architecture) is a far less elegant building than the Louvre's in Lens. Fujimoto's Mille Arbres design is also drawing criticism for its lack of public space. So just as we are about to enter the phase when so many of the results of this architectural  amour  will be opening, perhaps the affair with Japanese architecture is fading. As Roland Barthes wrote: "By its very perfection, this envelope, often repeated (you can be unwrapping a package forever), postpones the discovery of the object it contains - one which is often insignificant, for it is precisely a specialty of the Japanese package that the triviality of the thing be disproportionate to the luxury of the envelope."

<titre>BT chairman leads cheerleading for May's Brexit deal</titre>
<auteur>PATRICK JENKINS</auteur>
<texte>
		Jan du Plessis: Heave ho 
		Theresa May might be losing the confidence of parliament but the PM can still convene a roomful of business leaders. With only a few days' notice, more than 100 of them showed up on Monday night to toast the Brexit deal she had sealed with Brussels the day before. After a scene-setter from new Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, a rapid-fire presentation from Number 10 chief of staff Gavin Barwell and a few words from the PM herself, there was a bit of Q&amp;A.  
		 Many of the great and good were in attendance, including the City's key representatives on the PM's new business council for services - Paul Manduca, chairman of the Pru, and Shriti Vadera, who chairs Santander UK. Also there were high-octane figures from Aston Martin boss Andy Palmer to Goldman Sachs International chief Richard Gnodde. Most kept a low profile. But Jan du Plessis, the new BT chairman, took the prize for sycophant of the month, praising Mrs May's "tenacity and determination" and promising to urge fellow business leaders to "get behind the PM" and her Brexit deal. "You might have seen a couple of people with their fingers down their throat," one attendee told City Insider. A queasy double-meaning to reports that the room was heaving.
		Arnaud de Bresson: Allez-retour 
		The boss of Paris Europlace, Arnaud de Bresson, was over in London on Wednesday for the FT's Brexit and Beyond conference. The man whose job it is to woo business from the City to Paris did his bit to promote the merits of the French financial centre. But more impressive was the speed and efficiency of his commute. He spent the morning in Paris, attending the UN's launch of its responsible banking principles, before hotfooting it by Eurostar to his early afternoon session at the FT conference near Tower Bridge. Then back to Paris to see Paul McCartney's gig in <mention id="2000">La Défense</mention>. For all his keenness to see France profit from Brexit, he's hoping the frictionless travel is unharmed. Live and let die, as Macca might say. 
		 Jon Cunliffe: Down at heel 
		Never mind the 10.5 per cent slump in the economy that the Bank of England predicted on Wednesday would ensue in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, had urgent business to attend to. Finding perhaps that his shoes were not prepared for the biblical flood that Brexit will unleash (or at least leaked in Wednesday's drizzle), he repaired to Loake's round the corner from the Old Lady of Threadneedle St. Minus his security pass unfortunately. City Insider encountered Sir Jon queueing with the plebs - and being subjected to the same search and security checks - before he was allowed back into the Old Lady's hallowed halls for the press conference that delivered that torrent of Brexit bad news. 
		 Reform Club: No grousing 
		To the Reform Club on Pall Mall for a good old-fashioned lunch with one of City Insider's oldest chums. The day was autumnal. The fires were roaring in the grates. But imagine the disappointment when said chum ordered the grouse, only to be told there was none. The combination of spring storms and summer wildfires killed off the grouse season almost before it had begun. Result: very few birds. And a 50 per cent jump in prices. "It's just too expensive," said the apologetic maître d'. "We've taken it off the menu." Happily, the pheasant did a valiant job of filling in.

<titre>The reinvention of Société Générale's investment bank</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE</auteur>
<texte>
		It has been 20 years since Société Générale gave up the quaint trappings of historic Paris for the gleaming practicality of <meronyme id="2001">its towers</meronyme> in <mention id="2002">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="2003">Paris's modern business district</mention>. 
		 Now, Séverin Cabannes, SocGen's new investment bank chief, is on a mission to convince shareholders of the merits of another pragmatic break with the past - reinventing his division around a broader base than the market-leading equities derivatives franchise that critics say is fading fast.
		The investment bank has been under fierce scrutiny following the March departure of Mr Cabannes' predecessor Didier Valet and a "watershed" first quarter where SocGen's equities revenues rose just 6 per cent while rival BNP Paribas' were up 38 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs data.  
		 Rival bankers and former SocGen staff say its woes started much earlier, beginning with the departure almost 10 years ago of the star traders who created the bank's market-leading equity derivatives business, including Jean-Pierre Mustier, now chief executive of Italian lender UniCredit. 
		 "They lost some real leaders in the field who were instrumental in getting SocGen where they got to," said one equities professional who used to work at SocGen and now works for a rival bank. "It's a real real shame for the amazing franchise that they had."  
		 SocGen is now Emea's [Europe, Middle East and Africa] third biggest equities operator by revenue, having lost its number one ranking in 2013, according to data from industry monitor Coalition. Its shares have fallen 23 per cent since March 1; shares in the benchmark Stoxx EU 50 banks have fallen almost 17 per cent over the same period, while shares in France's CAC 40 have risen almost 1.5 per cent.  
		 In an interview with the Financial Times at the bank's headquarters, Mr Cabannes said he does not think equity derivatives is what differentiates SocGen any more, but that the bank must explain itself better.  
		 "I think we have still to do more pedagogic work," said the 60-year-old Frenchman, who has been at SocGen since 2007. "In the first quarter we made a dedicated deep dive on our global market activities for our investors and analysts. It was very well received and I think we have to continue in that direction."  
		 The deep dive emphasised the extent of the fixed income business, which SocGen deliberately began growing in the aftermath of the financial crisis because the bank believed it attracted a risk premium for being overly exposed to equities.  
		 Mr Cabannes stands by SocGen's attempt at reinvention by investing in fixed income at a time when almost every other bank in the world was cutting it back, as well as SocGen's decision to limit risk exposure in the "unstable" markets of the first quarter, when volatility lurched from record lows to extreme highs and the lender "had a low risk appetite". 
		 SocGen - which will soon buy Commerzbank's structured financial and investment products business, EMC, according to people familiar with the matter - is trying to increase its penetration with corporate clients, who make up just 35 per cent of its existing base, so that it is not so reliant on financial institutions.  
		 Mr Cabannes also hints that the bank could adjust its product focus to better fit the kind of market conditions that he blames for its poor first-quarter performance.  
		 "What we see today is you have more demand in flow products than in structured products," he said. "So, that is a question but it's not what we have really decided yet. Perhaps we can reweight a bit our flow activities compared to our structured product activities."

		 But he is cautious on whether such an adjustment would yield meaningful results, and sees the conditions of the first quarter as transitory rather than permanent, and as such has no plans for big shifts.  
		 "The problem we have is that the perception of investors takes time to be convinced," he said. "For me it's a very clear strategy we have continuously delivered and this strategy is still the same." 
		 Among analysts, scepticism remains high. "The first quarter was a watershed . . . Banks printed money in equity derivatives, SocGen was weak relative to US peers and BNP," said one.  
		 "Fifteen years ago, I used to call it the Goldman Sachs of French banking, they had a bad quarter once every year, but their other three quarters more than made up for it." Now, "there's an opportunity for competitors to attack the franchise". 
		 Citi analyst Azzurra Guelfi said first-quarter equities revenues were "a disappointment" and "management did not fully address market concerns in the call in explaining the reason for this weakness compared to peers".  
		 "We are monitoring the development in the second quarter to assess if this was a particular weakness in the quarter," she added.  
		 The investment bank's attempts at reinvention find a kinder audience internally at SocGen, which is in the early stages of a three-year strategic plan to boost returns by cutting costs and accelerating a push into digital banking.  
		 "We are no longer what we were 10 years ago, a pure equity derivatives house," said Philippe Heim, the bank's deputy chief executive and international retail boss. "We were the nerds in that space and we developed the business . . . We had a great generation of guys inventing all the new products." 
		 Now, said Mr Heim, "we managed to turn this platform that was purely focused on equity derivatives products into now a cross-asset derivative house."  
		 The scope of that revamped investment bank has been capped, since 2014, at 20 per cent of SocGen's group-wide capital, reducing the likelihood that the whole of SocGen could ever be rocked by a scandal such as Jérôme Kerviel's $7.2bn rogue trading spree.  
		 While there are no shortage of former SocGen insiders and rivals to question the bank's recent performance, and its pedigree, it remains Emea's third-biggest equities operator, behind only JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.  
		 "Excellence is the clients' perception. We have a great perception from the clients still," said Mr Cabannes. "Ask the client, not the competition. They are necessarily negative. Don't ask our former colleagues who left the company. They are frustrated."  
		 One former colleague whose opinion could matter to Mr Cabannes and his colleagues is UniCredit's Mr Mustier, who has been exploring a merger with SocGen.  
		 "Jean-Pierre Mustier represents a blessed era for SocGen and he's a man who rebuilt himself after Kerviel, so it's a double seduction," said one person who worked with Mr Mustier at SocGen.  
		 Turbulent times 
		 The poor equity derivatives performance in the first quarter, which caused investor disquiet, came during one of the bank's more turbulent periods.  
		 Didier Valet, one of Société Générale's top managers and a potential heir to CEO Frédéric Oudéa, resigned abruptly in March over the recently settled Libor-manipulation litigation. The bank has also just agreed a settlement with US authorities over another case involving corruption and bribery of the Libyan Investment Authority. A third case to do with sanctions is still pending. 
		 The litigation overhang had weighed on the stock price while investors were also questioning the bank's direction under Mr Oudéa. These shareholder concerns intensified after a management shake-up precipitated by Mr Valet's departure and the weak first quarter marked by the fading reliance on equity derivatives which has removed some of SocGen's original identity and selling point. 
		 A recently hired new head of equity derivates brought in from Bank of America Merrill Lynch has also raised eyebrows.

<titre>Bank watchdog rules out 'back-to-back' trading ban after Brexit</titre>
<auteur>CAROLINE BINHAM</auteur>
<texte>
		A top European financial watchdog has softened its position on a practice that many London-based banks hope will help them access EU markets after Brexit, putting it at odds with other regulators within the bloc. 
		 Andrea Enria, the head of the European Banking Authority, told the FT in an interview that a contentious way of transferring risk across borders was an indispensable "backbone" of global finance and would not be banned after Brexit.
		The EBA has previously raised concerns about the method - known as "back-to-back" operations - which bankers have been studying as a means of keeping more capital in the UK after Brexit. The European Central Bank continues to insist that the measure should be not be used to shift risk from the EU to the UK after the country's departure from the bloc. 
		 Back-to-back trading is a longstanding technique that has helped London prosper as a global trading hub by allowing banks to do deals in jurisdictions such as Africa and Latin America, but transfer the risk across borders by carrying out a parallel transaction in the UK. 
		 If applied after Brexit, it would enable banks to sell their services to the EU and the risk to be transferred to the UK. That could allow the institutions concerned to keep centralising their European capital needs and risk management in London - requiring fewer staff relocations to the EU. 
		 But the ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism, which oversees the eurozone's biggest banks, has warned institutions not to rely on back-to-back operations to mitigate the loss of business after Brexit. 
		 SSM officials strongly oppose any measure in which local supervisors cannot directly oversee banks' risk management - a particularly difficult issue if a bank gets into trouble. 
		 The SSM is also taking a tough line on other aspects of Brexit, insisting that Deutsche Bank take extensive measures to prepare for when its UK operations become a branch in a third country - which may force the lender to shift hundreds of billions of euros in assets to Frankfurt. 
		 The SSM has a leading role in supervising European banks, but Mr Enria's comments about back-to-back operations are notable because the EBA oversees national regulators and he himself is a prominent contender to succeed Danièle Nouy as the head of the SSM at the end of this year. 
		 In a recent paper in line with Mr Enria's remarks, the EBA said banks "may use back-to-back transactions or intragroup transactions to transfer a part of the risks to a non-EU-EEA entity", although it cautioned that local operations must not be "empty shell" or "brass plate" units and the scale of transactions involved must not be excessive. 
		 "We made clear that we don't want to see brass-plate organisations [ . . .] This doesn't mean that back-to-back operations which, for instance, are the backbone of global investment banking, will not be allowed," Mr Enria said in the FT interview. 
		 "If there is a shock hitting the firm, you want the local subsidiary to be able to manage the exposures locally. But this doesn't mean that you want all the local exposures to be managed locally." 
		 Mr Enria said the distribution of risk would be an issue for firms to discuss with local supervisors, ideally during Britain's 2019-2020 transition period after Brexit - although it is not yet certain that such a transition will take place, since a comprehensive exit deal has not been finally agreed. 
		 "This is not before time," said Bob Penn, a regulatory lawyer at Allen &amp; Overy, of Mr Enria's comments. "It's good news that within the European institutional structure someone [is] reflecting real-world practice and demands." 
		 A move to Paris, or Frankfurt 
		 The EBA will have to swap its Canary Wharf headquarters overlooking the towers of HSBC and Barclays for the office blocks of <mention id="2004">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="2005">its new post-Brexit home</mention>, from April. But Mr Enria may end up in Frankfurt.  
		 He is a leading contender to become the eurozone's banking supervisor-in-chief when Danièle Nouy finishes her five-year term as chair of the SSM in December. 
		 While Mr Enria is well respected in Frankfurt and Brussels, the EBA head faces stiff competition from Sharon Donnery, a deputy governor at Ireland's central bank. Ms Donnery is viewed highly by people within the SSM and is thought to be the favoured candidate of ECB president Mario Draghi.  
		 Mr Draghi will head a small interview panel that over the next fortnight will send a list of at least two names to the European Parliament. The parliament will then hold closed-door sessions with the candidates, before the ECB's governing council decides by secret ballot who will take the role. The council's decision can be vetoed by the parliament. 
		 A spokesperson for the ECB declined to comment on the process.

<titre>General Electric: Breaking up is easy to do</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		General Electric  took the last big step towards unwinding one of the biggest industrial conglomerates of our time, after it said on Tuesday that it would divest some of its largest divisions and focus instead on about three businesses. 
		 The move by chief executive  John Flannery  will undo much of the work of  Jack Welch , the famed GE executive who pieced the group together through a string of acquisitions. Now GE will centre its business around aero-engines and other aircraft parts; equipment for the power industry; and renewable energy, particularly wind.
		The cash raised from the sales will strengthen GE's balance sheet and cut its debts. The company hopes to halve its net debt to $25bn by 2020 and shrink  GE Capital  further.  
		 Flannery emphasised on a call with investors and media that the plan was now to focus on running the remaining businesses, as opposed to any transformational acquisitions. But investment banks still have some fees to earn on the asset sales. For what it's worth, GE remains a critical client to the likes of  JPMorgan ,  Goldman Sachs ,  Citi  and  Morgan Stanley . It has paid out more than $6bn in fees for M&amp;A advice, as well as debt, equity and loan underwriting services since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters. That trails only  Freddie Mac  and  Fannie Mae . 
		 One important thing not to miss amid the numerous announcements was the appointment of  Larry Culp  as the company's new lead independent director. Culp was the chief executive of industrials group  Danaher , where he was spectacularly successful.  
		 Danaher went on a spree of acquisitions under his leadership, but to better effect than GE. Since the turn of the century, Danaher shares have climbed more than tenfold. GE shares have dropped roughly 70 per cent, by contrast. 
		 The success had much to do with the company getting its operational performance right. That's part of the challenge for Flannery in righting GE. The other challenge, as Lex adroitly notes, is the big black box around its financials. The plan made public on Tuesday went some ways to addressing that. 
		 Bad management of operating businesses is partly to blame. The bigger culprit is soured tail risk from the company's black box finances. So it matters that simplification appears committed to simplification beyond shedding business with $45bn in sales. GE shares jumped nearly a tenth on Tuesday. The group may finally be heading back into the light.

		Sequoia chases SoftBank with $8bn fund 
		 Few investors in Asia could go toe-to-toe with  Neil Shen , the founder of  Sequoia Capital China . His powerful private equity group had made all the right calls on companies like Chinese ride-hailing group  Didi Chuxing  and news aggregator  Jinri Toutiao . Competition with Shen and Sequoia in the world of Chinese investment had been lacking. 
		 That was, at least, until  SoftBank  founder  Masayoshi Son  launched his $100bn Vision Fund - a move that has turned tech investment on its head. It now looks like some investors are responding by building their own war chest to compete for ever-bigger ticket sizes on internet and ecommerce groups. Shen has taken the message to heart. His firm's parent, Silicon Valley-based  Sequoia Capital , has just raised the first $6bn of what will be an $8bn global fund, or four times bigger than its previous fund. Here's the FT scoop from Henny Sender. 
		 "The magnitude is different today because the companies are different today," said Shen, who investors say is also raising a Rmb15bn ($2.3bn) fund focused on China. "To be the lead investor in a company you can no longer just invest $100m . . . if you want to build a company that is worth several billion. For that you need $400m or $500m." 
		 It's a lesson from the SoftBank playbook: ploughing tens of billions of dollars into lossmaking companies such as  Uber  and Didi Chuxing. The shared workplace group  WeWork , which is currently seeking to raise fresh funds at nearly double the $20bn valuation from a fundraising last August, took $4.4bn from SoftBank. 
		 Sequoia is placing similar bets, such as the one it has made by taking a large stake in online services group  Meituan  Dianping . The lossmaking company is now seeking a $60bn valuation in its forthcoming Hong Kong listing, up from $30bn less than three months ago. 
		 The new Sequoia fund comes against a private equity backdrop in Asia where the size of funds are growing. Last week  Carlyle  closed a $6.6bn Asia fund and  KKR  last year raised what was then the largest ever fund for the region at $9.3bn.  Hillhouse Capital Management  may even beat that figure later this year.

		 Saint-Gobain boss to the FT: 'Honestly, this is bullshit' 
		 Saint-Gobain  is perhaps not what you think of when you consider the world's most powerful companies, but the glass-through-ceramics maker is 350-years-old, pulls in some€40bn in sales every year and is a classic example of how French elites do capitalism. It's such an establishment company that it even provided the glass that went into building the famous Louvre Pyramid.  
		 It has also just come through a bruising multiyear attempt to take over Swiss chemical maker  Sika  - an endeavour that ultimately failed even if it did see Saint-Gobain book a nice capital gain and take nearly 11 per cent of the company it had wanted to control. 
		 The pursuit of Sika - which began in 2014 when Saint-Gobain tried to buy 52 per cent of the company's voting rights for just 16 per cent of the share capital - prompted multiple questions about Saint-Gobain's performance, strategy and management. 
		 The fact Sika's share price had outperformed Saint-Gobain's by a distance since the French company made its move didn't help matters. 
		 That's why Sarah Gordon and David Keohane sat down for a long lunch with Saint-Gobain chief Pierre-André de Chalendar at the top of <meronyme id="2006">the company's headquarters</meronyme> in <mention id="2007">Paris' business district of La Défense</mention>. 
		 The food, as you would imagine, was good but de Chalendar was in no mood to listen to questions about his company's performance. 
		 The atmosphere of the interview is perhaps best summed up with one response he gave when the FT asked if his business, built up over something like 1,000 acquisitions, was too complex: " Honestly, this is bullshit." It makes for a great profile and a recommended read from DD.

		 Sanaz Zaimi, Bank of America's head of global fixed income, currencies and commodities sales, will take the additional role of head of the US bank's expanded French operation, according to an FT report.

<titre>Sephora ramps up store openings as it taps 'beauty revolution'</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW</auteur>
<texte>
		France's Sephora is opening up to 150 stores a year as the LVMH-owned beauty and make-up retailer seeks to accelerate its global expansion and keep up with a "beauty revolution", according to its chief executive. 
		 "Our retail stores are thriving; they're alive, they're kicking," said Sephora chief Chris de Lapuente on Tuesday in an interview at the Financial Times Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid. "We're opening between 125 and 150 stores every year, and we're constantly renovating our biggest and best stores."
		Sephora's investment in physical stores underscores the key role it sees for bricks-and-mortar outlets to engage with customers, as part of an "omnichannel" approach that includes ecommerce and building an online community through social media. The regions that will have the most new stores are North America and Asia; and growth in China is forecast to double in the next few years.  
		 "What matters to us is to build wonderful relationships with our customers and the store is the place where these relationships are created and nurtured," said Mr de Lapuente. "Experiential retail is very much part of Sephora's DNA and we will continue investing in it." 
		 Sephora has enjoyed strong growth in the past few years on the back of soaring demand for cosmetics beauty products that has also benefited big brands such as L'Oréal and Estée Lauder.  
		 LVMH does not break out Sephora's performance in its results, but last year organic sales in the "selective retailing" division that Sephora is part of rose 12 per cent to€13.65bn (excluding the closure of Hong Kong airport concessions in 2017).  
		 "It's an extraordinarily dynamic market," said Mr de Lapuente, a former longtime Procter &amp; Gamble executive who became Sephora's chief in 2011. "We're living in a beauty revolution." 
		 On Friday a Sephora store will open on Times Square in New York, its largest in the country. Last week Sephora reopened <meronyme id="2008">its second-largest store in France</meronyme>, in <mention id="2009">the Paris business district of La Défense</mention>, after a major renovation. It is due to reopen its largest store in the world, at the Dubai Mall, on Thursday following an extensive overhaul.  
		 Sephora stocks about 300 brands, including its own private label, in 34 countries. It has 2,500 stores worldwide and employs 40,000 people. 
		 Mr de Lapuente said that, for Sephora, "experiential" retail meant that "when customers come into the stores they have a wonderful experience".  
		 He added: "I don't mind if the customer doesn't buy today, what I care deeply about is that they love their experience in Sephora [ . . .] if they walk out of the store with a smile on their face feeling like they've been listened to, they've discovered something, they've had a wonderful experience, they'll come back and they'll buy something next time."  
		 Ecommerce represents an average of 20 per cent sales in each country, although this can be as high as 30 per cent in some countries and as low as 5 per cent in others, said Mr de Lapuente. Customers who buy both online and offline tend to purchase three times more than those who buy in just one channel, he added.

<titre>Paris warns of threat to EU banking watchdog's relocation plans</titre>
<auteur>JIM BRUNSDEN</auteur>
<texte>
		France has warned that legal hurdles are hindering the relocation of Europe's top banking watchdog to Paris after Brexit. The delays mean that agency risks missing out on its preferred premises in the French capital. 
		 Paris last year won the race against seven other EU capitals to host the London-based European Banking Authority, which will have to move when the UK leaves the EU in March. The EBA and its 160 employees are to relocate in <meronyme id="2010">the Europlaza tower</meronyme> in <mention id="2011">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="2012">the high-rise business district on the western outskirts of Paris</mention>.
		But the French government this week voiced its frustration at the Brussels decision-making machine, deemed too slow to adopt the legislation allowing to shift the agency out of the UK, which may in turn cause the agency to lose out on its planned new offices if the issue is not resolved soon. 
		 Diplomats underlined that the current problems did not pose a risk to the relocation of the EBA to Paris, but did raise practical complications for the move.  
		 The owners of the building had set a deadline of Monday for the lease to be signed, Philippe Léglise-Costa, France's ambassador to the EU, told other EU governments on Wednesday. 
		 Mr Léglise-Costa warned of "financial, legal and human resources consequences" if the Monday deadline was not met, an outcome EU governments now consider inevitable. While France was looking for solutions, the landlord was nonetheless free to decide whether or not to keep the offer alive, Mr Léglise-Costa said, according to diplomats. 
		 The difficulties with the draft law have arisen because the European Parliament has said it will only adopt the legislation once it has received written assurances from governments that it will be kept better informed about decisions on where to locate coveted EU agencies. 
		 Pervenche Berès, a French Socialist and one of the lead MEPs working on the relocation law, told the FT that the assembly was "waiting for a response from the Council" - the EU institution that represents national governments - to its latest proposals. 
		 Othmar Karas, the other lead legislator on the file, said that he hoped the process "can be concluded very soon" given the "time constraints and for the sake of legal certainty". 
		 At the same time he complained that MEPs had not been properly involved in the decisions on relocating the EBA and the European Medicines Agency, another London-based body, after Brexit. "Future procedures for the location of agencies must . . . fully respect Parliament's role as co-legislator," he said.  
		 "The procedure for the location of EU agencies in the member states must not be about distributing candy to those who shout the loudest", Mr Karas said. "Efficiency, synergies and location attractiveness must be the key criteria." 
		 Diplomats complain that the stance has delayed a draft law since November 2017, which comes down to changing one sentence in European legislation to identify the EBA's location as Paris. 
		 National diplomats are set to meet in Brussels on Friday morning to discuss possible solutions. The French finance ministry said that it was seeking a "quick decision" on what is "a purely formal and legal issue". 
		 "The political decision to choose Paris was made last year and is not at stake", the ministry spokesperson said. "Time is of the essence to ensure a smooth transition from London to Paris."  
		 The EBA declined to comment. The building's owners, Northwood Asset Management, could not be reached for comment.

<titre>Leaving London: voices from the financial front lines of Brexit</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		In the 33 months since the UK voted to leave the EU, thousands of financial services companies with European hubs in London have been assessing their options.  
		 Many of them have concluded that the potential disruption of Brexit means they need to expand elsewhere in the EU, anticipating the loss of passporting rights that permit them to access clients across Europe.
		Financial Times research published last week found that the City of London's biggest international banks have moved fewer than 1,500 jobs from the UK in the run-up to Brexit, far fewer than originally estimated in many quarters. 
		 While relatively few people have shifted so far, rivals to London's crown as Europe's financial centre have been jostling to attract more Brexit escapers. Yet even the current trickle of new arrivals is stirring concern about upward pressure on property prices and extra competition for places at international schools. 
		 The FT has spoken to people in six of the cities affected by these moves - Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Milan and Madrid - to hear how Brexit is playing out. 
		 Paris 
		 Stefano Petricca remembers where he was when he realised that his fledgling London-based asset manager would have to pack its bags and head to the continent.  
		 "I was watching the referendum on local TV . . . I immediately understood that it was going the wrong way, immediately," Mr Petricca said in an interview with the Financial Times in Paris while setting up his new life. 
		 The 53-year-old Italian native is the founder and chief executive of Petricca &amp; Co Capital, a€700m asset manager, which he set up in London four years ago. 
		 To guard against the potential disruption of Brexit, he started planning a move to the continent as soon as the referendum result landed. He fired a handful of staff and uprooted his life, writing off the cost of obtaining UK licences. 
		 He chose Paris because of its top cultural attractions, as well as its established financial market infrastructure and its close travel links to London. 
		 His move to the French capital has been mirrored at larger banks and asset managers, with Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and a host of others shifting operations there. They were lured to Paris in part by a low-tax offer made by French President Emmanuel Macron.  
		 "We have seen an acceleration of teams being moved to Paris . . . there is still uncertainty and people are still waiting, but the plans are there and the first teams have been put in place," said Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, a French business lobby group that estimates some 20,000 jobs are shifting there from London. 
		 The moves are pushing up property prices and fuelling competition for scarce places at the city's best international schools. "We were able to increase the number of school places in Paris by 1,000 to close to 11,500," said Charline Avenel, who administers four major school districts around Paris, including Versailles.  
		 "The planning began two years ago, after the referendum," said Ms Avenel, pointing to a new school with an international section opening at Courbevoie near <mention id="2013">the business district of La Défense</mention> that has guaranteed school places to the European Banking Authority's staff as it moves from London to Paris. 
		 Prime office space in the centre of Paris is also already scarce, with Brexit only adding to the pressure. "In the most sought after areas of Paris the vacancy rates are at a record low of 1.7 per cent," said Philippe Perello, a Paris partner with Knight Frank. 
		 The same is true for high-end apartments. "There is a scarcity in the market . . . in the classic arrondissements, like the 16th, with a good stock of Haussmannian apartments, some with gardens, and close to the good schools, prices have jumped by over 5 per cent since Brexit," said Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, who works at Belles Demeures de France specialising in luxury real estate. She has been inundated recently with requests from bankers moving from London to Paris. 
		 Mr Petricca is himself searching for an apartment in Paris and although he "prays for a second referendum" his own move is now set in stone. "You know why; because I had to start to prepare lawyers and accountants to move one year ago." 
		 David Keohane in Paris 
		Frankfurt 
		 In the coffee shops and bars of Frankfurt's financial district that surrounds the city's old opera house, talk of Brexit has been drowned out by a different, yet equally contested topic: the merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. 
		 Both banks have their headquarters in the German city, and they are expected to sack tens of thousands of employees if the deal goes ahead. 
		 In the long run, Brexit is likely to impact Frankfurt more fundamentally than Deutsche's potential absorption of Commerzbank. But for now, little has changed in the sleepy city of 730,000 people. 
		 Since the Brexit vote in 2016, more than 45 financial institutions have set up or beefed up their presence in Germany, the vast majority of them choosing Frankfurt - including the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Standard Chartered. 
		 "Frankfurt is the first choice for Brexit banks," said Gertrud Traud, chief economist of Frankfurt based Helaba, a state-owned bank that is tracking the process closely. 
		 The total assets banks hold in the city is expected to rise by more than a fifth this year as they relocate several hundreds of billions of euros from London. The clearing volume of euro-denominated derivatives such as interest rate swaps - close to zero when Britain voted to leave the EU - jumped more than tenfold last year alone. 
		 For now lenders are only moving "the bare minimum" of jobs from London to Frankfurt that they need to satisfy regulators, said Joachim Wuermeling, a Bundesbank board member. "There will be a second wave, but at the moment it is very difficult to assess how big it will be." Most banks have been hiring locally for any extra jobs in Frankfurt. 
		 "We have a number of employees ready to move instantly in a hard Brexit situation, but so far almost no one has made the plunge," said a Frankfurt-based employee at a large US investment bank. 
		 Germany's financial capital, which lack's London's global buzz or Paris' cultural flair, has done little to woo banks. Mayor Peter Feldmann, a left-of-centre Social Democrat, avoids the sector. The federal government in Berlin has, however, promised to make it easier for banks to fire highly paid senior staff.  
		 While partly driven by Brexit, the boom in Frankfurt's commercial and residential real estate market is mainly caused by low interest rates and a strong local economy outside of banking. 
		 Residential rents are up 58 per cent since 2014, and commercial rents for premium office space in prime locations were up 7.3 per cent last year alone, according to BNP Paribas Real Estate.  
		 Expectations of tens of thousands of extra finance jobs have been scaled back. Helaba's latest estimate is that by the end of next year, Brexit will have pushed the staff employed by foreign banks up by 2,000 to about 4,500. 
		 Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt 
		Dublin 
		 Dublin was in the grip of acute financial crisis when Barry Mangan left the Irish capital for London a decade ago. By the time the JPMorgan Chase executive returned last year, the Irish capital was booming again and set for an influx of Brexit bankers.  
		 Mr Mangan, who is in his mid-30s, is chief risk officer at JPMorgan's payments unit in Dublin's docklands financial centre. His own move was not directly linked to Brexit. But it came as concern grew that an influx of bankers would squeeze property and school spaces.  
		 Data from IDA Ireland, the state investment agency, suggest Brexit-related projects will create more than 5,000 jobs in an already accelerating economy.  
		 Although Mr Mangan had heard "horror stories" about Dublin's hot housing market, he and his wife managed to buy a home after six months. "It took some time but nothing crazy," he said. 
		 Dozens of companies have made Dublin their EU hub as the UK prepares to leave the bloc, and this shows no sign of slowing down.  
		 EY, the accountancy firm, reported that 28 financial services groups have committed to relocate staff or operations to Dublin since the 2016 referendum. Among them are Citigroup, Bank of America, Barclays, Legal &amp; General and Axa. 
		 More than 100 companies have sought Central Bank of Ireland authorisation to operate in the country and IDA Ireland said 70 new investments are linked directly to Brexit, many outside the financial sector.  
		 Yet John McCartney, research director with estate agents Savills Ireland, said many companies are setting up in Dublin with only small teams. " They're finding out about the city, seeing how the land lies . . . If the need arises they will be in a position to scale up," he said. 
		 William Tighe, director with Dwellworks, a specialist international relocation agency, reported a "sustained uplift" in business because of Brexit, adding that the rise in "actionable relocations" has been in the thousands. 
		 Places are scarce in Irish state schools, leaving many people to turn to fee-paying institutions. "We're seeing more placements into private schools and the international schools as a result of these transferees coming in," Mr Tighe said.  
		 Rents are expensive, with prices in the swishest Dublin suburbs on a par with London or Paris. But the surging house price inflation that took hold after the crash has eased. Residential prices rose 5.6 per cent in the year to January, slowing from 11.8 per cent in the previous 12 months. 
		 Mr Mangan is glad to be back in Dublin, saying non-Irish colleagues who have moved there are "generally very pleasantly surprised" at "how vibrant it is and how lively it is". 
		 Arthur Beesley in Dublin 
		Amsterdam 
		 For Harm Bots, the new head of Royal Bank of Scotland's expanded Amsterdam office, one of the best things about the Dutch city is its proximity to London. 
		 "I can get up in Amsterdam and catch the 7 o'clock flight to London City and still be in the office by 8am, sometimes beating my colleagues who are commuting in London," said Mr Bots, who recently returned to the city he left 14 years ago after stints in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and London. 
		 Mr Bots, who is running RBS's Dutch subsidiary NatWest Markets NV, is among the hundreds of bankers leaving the UK to work for new European entities, which have been set up so banks can continue servicing clients across the region after Brexit.  
		 Many of those quitting the UK in the first wave of departures are like Mr Bots: foreign nationals from Europe returning to their native country.  
		 The RBS executive, who lived in London for seven years until November, said he will miss its world-class culture. "I love London. It's a fast city, and when I think about the events and exhibitions it's great," he said. "But the good news is I'm still often there. And the family can go back to see friends." 
		 Amsterdam's enviable location and conveniently positioned international airport - seven minutes by train from the financial centre - are among its main selling points, making it well connect to other financial hubs such as Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris. 
		 Despite its benefits, including the fact that English is widely spoken, Amsterdam is unlikely to become a hub for investment banking. One factor holding it back is the rule capping bankers' bonuses at 20 per cent of fixed salary - in effect a tenth of what others earn elsewhere in the EU.  
		 Nonetheless, several trading groups - including CBOE Europe and the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise platform - have picked Amsterdam as their post-Brexit hub, as has Japanese bank MUFG.  
		 Their expansion threatens to stoke inflation in already surging property prices. In 2017, the city was added to the UBS global real estate bubble index, and now ranks seventh after London and New York on the ratio of average property prices to income.  
		 The Municipality of Amsterdam has responded by proposing a ban on new-build properties financed with buy-to-let mortgages, targeting landlords seeking to rent out apartments on sites such as Airbnb. But the measure also threatens to limit the supply of housing for workers moving to Amsterdam.  
		 "The city is relatively full, there's talk of a tourist tax," said Clifford Abrahams, chief financial officer of ABN Amro. " The housing market is already strained and people are worried about their kids getting on the housing ladder," he added. 
		 David Crow in London 
		Milan 
		 Davide Serra, founder of a fast-growing $12bn investment company in London, is one of the most high-profile repatriates to Milan since the UK voted to leave the EU.  
		 The 48-year-old left Milan at the age of 22 after winning a place on Warburg's UK graduate trainee scheme and he never looked back. That is, until Brexit happened. 
		 "I have contingency plans," said Mr Serra. "I can move anyone into any major jurisdiction, depending on what Brexit turns out to be. I am hoping for the best but prepared for the worst." 
		 He said his decision to move with his wife and their four children to Milan from London was a personal one. For now, his Algebris business, which specialises in banking investments and makes a third of sales from Italian clients remains anchored in London with offices in New York, Milan, Luxembourg and Singapore.  
		 Hefty tax breaks offered by the former Renzi government, of which Mr Serra was an outspoken financial supporter, have lured many Italian financiers back from London. 
		 Mr Serra said a tax break was not his primary motivation. Instead, he was worried that he and his wife with their British passports and their UK-born and English-speaking children could both find themselves "cut off" from Britain and "find it harder to work across Europe in the future" because of Brexit.  
		 "I want to make sure my kids are fully bicultural and not just bilingual," he said. "London is the best city in the world - I am convinced London will prevail and London will fight back - but I also realised London is not going to be what is used to be." 
		 Italy has changed since he left. "Milan has become the true Italian capital," he said. The "grey, dark, dirty and dangerous" northern city he recalls has been transformed since hosting the World's Fair in 2015.  
		 Qatari and Chinese money has poured into property developments, tourist numbers are higher than in Rome, new international schools have opened luring UK teachers with higher euro-denominated salaries. Crucially, it has also become the "gateway city" for Italy's export-driven economy to access Europe and the world. 
		 Mr Serra said this brings two advantages: "At an entrepreneurial level I get more contact with the real economy than I had in London, and there's also a growing international Italian community who felt ill at ease with the Brexiters and have come to Milan." All in all, the move back "has been very pleasant," he said. 
		 Still, he has not turned his back on the UK. Last year, he set up a Policy and Research Forum, signing up German former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, Denmark's former prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Mr Renzi to debate and promote the values of the EU. The first two debates were in Milan and London. 
		 Rachel Sanderson in Milan 
		Madrid 
		 Sebastián Albella, head of Spain's securities regulator, has a number of theories why the trickle of post-Brexit bankers moving to Madrid has been below expectations. 
		 He blamed a sense of instability caused by the conflict in Catalonia and a lack of tax breaks for companies like those other countries have used to attract international banks looking to set up new EU hubs. 
		 Still, he said that "the game is not over yet", pointing to the arrival of bankers from Credit Suisse and a number of smaller institutions. 
		 Madrid will be home to some of the 250 employees Credit Suisse is expected to move out of London, as the Swiss bank establishes an investment banking hub paired with its other main continental European base in Frankfurt. 
		 Matthew Taylor, headmaster of King's College in Madrid, said the English-language school is seeing many more enquiries "most notably since Christmas" from people with finance backgrounds engaging in contingency planning. He said more banks and multinationals are also asking if the school has space for students.  
		 The impact has so far been limited, however, with only about 10 new students relocating from the UK for Brexit-related reasons. "There's an equally large, if not greater, interest from people relocating from Venezuela," he added.  
		 Those who do move to Madrid will find a real estate market in full upswing, with prices higher than when the bubble popped during the 2008 financial crisis. Sale prices rose 17.2 per cent in Madrid in the year to January, according to Beatriz Toribio, head of research at real estate portal Fotocasa.  
		 "We are seeing annual increases above 15 per cent in the central and prime districts and we've seen them since the end of 2017," she said. "Madrid is going at a very high speed both in rental and in sale prices." 
		 Prices rose in rich as well as poor areas, with apartment sale prices jumping 13.4 per cent in well-heeled Salamanca and climbing more than 10 per cent in the nearby suburbs of Las Rozas and Majadahonda. 
		 Housing sales to British buyers slumped in 2017, the year after the Brexit vote, but rebounded in 2018 as the exit date grew closer. British buyers accounted for 10,722 transactions in 2018, or almost 15 per cent of sales to foreign buyers, the largest market share.  
		 While most were for second homes, some 2,500 were to people moving to Spain for work reasons, said Patricio Palomar Murillo, head of alternative investments at AIRE Partners. "What we're primarily seeing is the arrival of executives, not that of less-qualified people who need to establish themselves," Mr Palomar said.

<titre>December strikes in Paris: travel disruptions to look out for</titre>
<auteur>VICTOR MALLET</auteur>
<texte>
		Mass public-sector strikes and demonstrations will disrupt travel to and from Paris, within the French capital and across much of France on Thursday. The actions are expected to last for at least several days.  
		 The strikes, likely to involve hundreds of thousands of workers in government and state companies, were launched by the communist-aligned CGT and other trade unions to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's proposed reform to the country's pension systems. 
		Few private-sector employees are involved - other than lawyers who have their own pension regime - but public-sector teachers, health workers and firefighters as well as students are also expected to air their grievances in street demonstrations.  
		 Business in Paris will be severely disrupted, and many companies have already cancelled meetings or travel to and from France. 
		 If you are planning to travel, here is what you need to know about potential disruptions: 
		 French and international rail 
		SNCF, the state-owned rail group, says only about one train in 10 will run on suburban, long-distance and high-speed rail routes. For Eurostar trains between the UK and Europe, the frequency will be one in two, and for Thalys services linking Paris to Brussels, Amsterdam and Cologne, two in three.  
		 Paris transport 
		Eleven metro lines will be closed on Thursday, and the rest will be severely disrupted, except the driverless trains on lines 1 and 14, between <mention id="2014">La Défense</mention> and Château de Vincennes, and Saint-Lazare and Olympiades, respectively.  
		 On the buses, RATP, the Paris transport authority, says services will be running at a third of their normal level during the day. Taxi services, Uber and car rentals face heavy demand. Your correspondent will be on his bicycle as usual.  
		 Air travel 
		France's civil aviation authority, the DGAC, said industrial action - expected by some air traffic controllers and some employees of Air France-KLM - would disrupt flights in and out of France on Thursday.  
		 It has asked airlines to cut their scheduled flights by a fifth on the day for flights serving Paris airports and those of Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse and Bordeaux. Air France and easyJet were among airlines announcing flight cancellations.

<titre>Europe's banking watchdog warns on wave of dirty money</titre>
<auteur>CAROLINE BINHAM</auteur>
<texte>
		New powers given to Europe's banking watchdog are not enough to stem the tide of dirty money sweeping through the bloc that has been revealed by recent scandals, the head of the European Banking Authority said. 
		 In his first interview as chief executive, José Manuel Campa told the Financial Times that the mandate handed to the EBA this year in the wake of Danske Bank's€200bn money-laundering scandal was a narrow, co-ordinating role rather than one that will ensure even defences across the EU against ill-gotten gains.
		"There have been cases of money laundering in Europe, yes, in some cases pretty sizeable ones. I'm not saying we have a good system," Mr Campa said at the EBA's new Paris headquarters. 
		 "But . . . I don't think the mandate that the EBA has received is the mandate that will solve that problem," he said. "It is not a mandate to harmonise AML [anti-money laundering], either regulation or practices, across the union. Because to start that process you first need legislation." 
		 Mr Campa took up his post last month at a crucial time for the EBA, which has a regulatory role over national authorities, ensuring that banking rules are implemented in an even way across the EU. He arrives as the agency's credibility has been severely dented by its approach to the Danske Bank scandal.  
		 The EBA's board of supervisors - made up of national regulators from across the EU's 28 member states - voted to close an EBA investigation into failings by the Danish and Estonian regulators, despite draft findings identifying four potential breaches of EU law. 
		 Mr Campa warned against "extrapolating" what that ruling by the EBA's board of directors might mean about its appetite for tackling money laundering. "Because I think there is a strong record of the EBA coming forward with decisions that have been helpful in constructing the single market." 
		 The Danske Bank revelations are part of a wave of money-laundering scandals to hit the EU over the past 18 months, laying bare weaknesses in the enforcement of EU rules that require banks to carry out due diligence checks on customers.  
		 In response to the scandal, the European Commission this year centralised anti-money laundering powers at the EBA. But its mandate is limited to collecting, analysing and disseminating information to ensure that national authorities "effectively and consistently supervise the risks of money-laundering and that they co-operate and share information".  
		 Pointing out that the EBA has been given only 10 staff to carry out its new work on AML, he said: "We need to be prudent on the expectations of the mandate the EBA has on AML. It has been an evolutionary situation and we have a mandate to try to co-ordinate the single regulatory framework of AML."  
		 There have been calls for Europe to establish an entirely new authority to combat money laundering. But Mr Campa said this would first require EU legislation to harmonise the bloc's AML rules, which leave member states with flexibility on how to interpret directives. 
		 "You need to start with regulation that is homogeneous. We don't have that. AML as an activity in the EU is regulated by directives. By definition that does not provide a single rule book. If you have a single rule book you can start thinking about a single authority. So maybe the discussion has gone too fast." 
		 Mr Campa inherits a full in-tray from his predecessor, Andrea Enria - now the head of the eurozone's banking supervisor at the European Central Bank, one of the EBA's most influential constituents - not least the move of 195 staff from London to Paris following the Brexit vote. 
		 Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, is due to officially open <meronyme id="2018">the EBA's headquarters</meronyme> in <mention id="2019">the Paris business district of La Défense</mention> this week in a ceremony that will reinforce the French government's desire to see Paris benefit from the impact of Brexit on the financial services sector. 
		 The priorities for Mr Campa, a Spanish economist who was a senior executive at Banco Santander, include reforming the EBA's stress tests of banks' balance sheets - which have been criticised for being too easy and subject to national regulators' varying interpretations. He also needs to balance rules for traditional lenders against the arrival of fintech firms and tackle money-laundering. 
		 Special interests and national pride have often appeared to be at the root of the EBA's problems, as the agency tries to ensure a level playing field across the bloc on issues such as money-laundering and stress tests. 
		 "National regulators are proudly reluctant to be confronted with weak banks that come out of their jurisdictions. They would rather have stronger banks," Mr Campa said. 
		 Brussels proposed in 2017 that the EBA be equipped with a full-time executive board to ensure "effective, impartial and EU-oriented decisions", but the move was resisted by national governments. 
		 Mr Campa's comments were echoed by Olivier Guersent, the European Commission's director-general for financial stability, who said the governance reforms should be revisited. "The governance issue is that no one really wants their neighbour to look at what they are cooking in their kitchen," said Mr Guersent said at an FT conference in Paris last week.

<titre>December strikes in Paris: travel disruptions to look out for</titre>
<auteur>VICTOR MALLET</auteur>
<texte>
		Tempers have begun to fray in Paris after two weeks of disruptive public sector strikes over President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plan, with the threat to rail services from leftwing trade unions that are influential in the state railway company SNCF now extending over the Christmas holidays.  
		 It is important to note, however, that disruption has been much more severe in the French capital than elsewhere in the country, largely because RATP - the company that runs the Paris metro and bus services - is also severely affected by strikes. Very few private sector employees have been striking or protesting. 
		Parisians and those living in the suburbs have taken to sharing cars to commute, as well as dragging out old bicycles from their cellars. But rush-hour congestion remains severe. 
		 Suburban rail services have been severely reduced, but are still running during rush hours. Some long-distance trains and a reasonable proportion of international trains on the Eurostar and Thalys continue to operate, with companies typically giving two to three days of advance warning about which trains have been cancelled. Some flights have been cancelled because of partial strike among air traffic controllers.  
		 If you are planning to travel, here is what you need to know about potential disruptions: 
		 French and international rail 
		SNCF, the state-owned rail group, gives daily updates on how many trains are running on suburban, long-distance and high-speed rail routes. For Eurostar trains between the UK and Europe, the frequency has increased in recent days. Thalys services linking Paris to Brussels, Amsterdam and Cologne, have been only partly affected. 
		 Paris transport 
		Up to eleven metro lines have been closed each day. The driverless trains have been running as normal on lines 1 and 14, between <mention id="2020">La Défense</mention> and Château de Vincennes, and Saint-Lazare and Olympiades, respectively. Buses run by RATP, the Paris transport authority, have also been hit by the strike and are affected by heavy traffic congestion. Taxi services, Uber and car rentals face heavy demand. Your correspondent will be on his bicycle as usual.  
		 Air travel 
		Industrial action from some air traffic controllers and some employees of Air France-KLM has been disrupting flights in and out of France.

<titre>FRANCE-SECURITY/ (UPDATE 1) UPDATE 1-French police kill man who threatened officers with knife in Paris</titre>

<texte>
		(Adds details) 
		 PARIS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Police officers shot dead a man who threatened them with a knife in <mention id="2023">the Paris business district of La Defense</mention> on Friday, police sources said. 
		 A security man had alerted police to the presence of a man armed with a knife in <meronyme id="2024">La Defense Square</meronyme>.
		The suspect rushed towards the three-men patrol that had gone to check the situation, wielding the knife and shouting: "I am going to kill you", the sources said. 
		 Seven shots were fired, with two shots hitting the man in the chest and in the thigh. The man carried no identify papers. 
		 Authorities have told people to avoid the area. (Reporting by Gus Trompiz, Sophie Louet, Writing by Dominique Vidalon and Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Angus MacSwan)

<titre>France: Mighty new metro</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Vast tunnelling is under way 
		 DEEP IN THE ground beneath <mention id="2025">the western Paris business district</mention>, the din is bone-jangling. With compact mechanical diggers, workers are excavating rubble from 22-metre (72-feet) shafts. These will take 60 supporting pillars for a vast new train station, to be buried 35 metres underground. Welcome to one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects: an ambitious scheme to encircle Paris with a new metro loop, and shift the way people think and move about the capital. 
		 The new station at <mention id="2026">La Défense</mention>, built as part of the westward extension of the E line, will link up to a huge looping network known as the "Grand Paris Express". Most of the French capital's existing rail and metro lines are there to carry people in and out of the city centre. The new underground loops, by contrast, focus on moving them around the suburbs.
		One loop will run from Charles de Gaulle airport in the north, via the banlieue of Seine-Saint-Denis, westward to the skyscrapers of <mention id="2027">La Défense</mention>, and on in a ring around southern and eastern Paris, outside the capital's périphérique ring road. A second loop will link the first to Orly airport in the southern suburbs, and then west via the Saclay university cluster at Palaiseau to Versailles. When complete, the new driverless underground network will feature 68 new stations and cover 200km, nearly twice the length of London's new Crossrail. 
		 Like Crossrail, the new Paris express has been beset by delays and cost increases. A damning report by the French national auditor, in December 2017, pointed then to an estimated total cost of EUR38.5bn ($43bn), up from EUR19bn in 2010, when the publicly financed project began. Last year, the government finally conceded that only part of the network would be finished by 2024, when Paris hosts the Olympic games. A new fast link to Charles de Gaulle airport may also not be ready by then. Part of the southern loop will not open until 2030, or later still. 
		 Naturally, everyone blames everyone else, easy to do in a city with baffling and overlapping layers of local and regional government. Yet, in time, the effect could be radical. The new network should help to defy the mighty centralising force of Paris, which obliges commuters who live in one suburb and work in another to pass through the centre. This will relieve pressure on city-centre lines, and could give a boost to suburban business hubs. Parisians tend to hold a mental map of their city that stops at the périphérique. The new network, says Jean-Louis Missika, deputy mayor for planning at the capital's town hall, marks the end of a model that "assumes Paris is the centre of the world".

<titre>How the DRC Government Has Secretly Breached its Own Logging Moratorium.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Jul 12, 2016 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- A Greenpeace Africa investigation has revealed that the DRC government violated its own 2002 moratorium on new logging titles, granting in 2015 three concessions of a total of 650.000 hectares 
		 KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo -- A Greenpeace Africa (http://www.Geenpeace.org/Africa) investigation has revealed that the DRC government violated its own 2002 moratorium on new logging titles, granting three concessions of a total of 650.000 hectares in 2015 to a company called Societe la Millenaire Forestiere SARL (SOMIFOR) in Equateur and Tshuapa Provinces, and to another firm called La Forestiere pour le Developpement du Congo SARL (FODECO) in Tshopo Province. Greenpeace researchers obtained the concession contracts signed in 2015 by then Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development Bienvenu Liyota Ndjoli.
		On 30th of January 2016, Robert Bopolo Mbongeza, the Minister of Environment, Conservation of Nature and Sustainable Development (MECNDD) stated that "measures are underway" to lift the moratorium [[i]]. At the time of his announcement, the Minister must have been aware that his predecessor illegally allocated these three logging concessions. Under the current Minister's responsibility, a whole a series of meetings with villages in the concession areas took place and social clauses were signed in March and April 2016. In the briefing report (greenpeace.org/africa/Global/africa/Forests/Publications/EN%20Briefer%20Greenpeace%20SOMIFOR%20FODECO%2012072016%20low%20res.pdf) published today, Greenpeace presents evidence that via these secret allocations, the DRC government is circumventing the moratorium, with the intention to lift it before preconditions have been met, threatening the world's second largest rainforest. 
		 Yet, it is clear that the preconditions for lifting this safeguard measure are far from achieved and that it would create an even greater chaos in the forest sector. "We demand that the DRC government immediately cancel SOMIFOR's and FODECO's concessions and ensure accountability of all officials associated with the violations. The Minister should also determine whether there has been any further breaches of the moratorium", said Irene Wabiwa Betoko, Forest campaign manager at Greenpeace Africa. In a letter dated June 9th, Greenpeace asked the Minister of Environment for clarification about these flagrant violations of the moratorium, but never received an answer. These cases will be sent to the Public Prosecutor of DRC to investigate these issues. 
		 The country's 155 million ha of forests represent around a tenth of the world's remaining tropical forest, and is home to forest elephants, gorillas, bonobos, okapis, hundreds of bird species and thousands of plants. The moratorium was established in 2002 to prevent a post-war free-for-all in the country's huge forests, and protect this unique biodiversity. With World Bank guidance and financial support, the DRC was to transform logging into a sustainable industry generating billions of dollars of revenues and tens of thousands of jobs, while conserving the forest. Yet, instead of implementing the measures it committed to, the DRC government constantly violated this moratorium, allocating scores of illegal titles, fueling corruption and creating social and economic havoc. 
		 To oppose the lifting of this moratorium, Greenpeace and other environmental and anti-corruption organizations have formed a coalition [[ii]], and raised the alarm bells loudly in early 2016. "The DRC government must maintain the moratorium on the allocation of new forest concessions as long as all the conditions defined by law are not met", stated Wabiwa. "Industrial logging does not generate significant tax revenue for the DRC government, contributing a pitiful USD 8 million in 2014 [[iii]]. The Congolese authorities should consider and promote alternatives such as community forestry", added Wabiwa. 
		 Some 40 million people in the country rely on these forests for their livelihoods, including food and fuel, whilst forest cover in the DRC alone stores 7% of the world's forest carbon - making it one of the largest forest carbon stocks in the world.

<titre>Mineralogical composition of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates and dimensional stability of slag aggregate concretes.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.04.036 
		 ABSTRACT 
		 An interesting valorisation way of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag is their use as aggregates in concrete. Mineralogical studies of these steel slags are therefore necessary. In this study, observations of slag aggregates under UV light are associated with usual mineralogical analyses (XRD, SEM and EDS) to ensure more representative results of the mineralogical variability within slag aggregates. Relationships between aggregate mineral composition and UV fluorescence colours are proposed. Mineralogical studies also show that the stainless steel slag contains low amounts of expansive mineral phases (free CaO, free MgO) that could affect concrete volume stability. To verify this finding, swelling measurements of high strength concretes made of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates are carried out. The linear expansion of stainless steel slag concretes is slightly higher than that measured for concretes with silico-calcareous aggregates.

		 1. Introduction 
		 The increasing use of steel in the world generates a large amount of steel slags. In Europe, the amount of stainless steel slag produced in 2010 totals about 4.0 million tonnes while the blast furnace slag generated, amounted to about 23.5 million tonnes. About 40% of stainless steel slag produced in 2010 is EAF slag and 60% AOD slag. Less than 75% of stainless steel slags are reused. If not recovered, these steel slags increase the amount of waste to be treated and disposed in landfills. Their reuse as construction materials could be an interesting alternative providing a sustainable material. Many studies have been conducted on the use of steel slags as aggregate in concrete [1-13], Most of them deal with carbon steel slags. Very few studies concern slags from stainless steel production (Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag and Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) slag) because of their mineral composition, in particular, their high chromium content [14-17]. However, recent research studies have shown that it is possible to reduce the teachable chromium of these slags and make them usable [18]. EAF slag is generated during melting scrap in an electric furnace. It is a crystalline rock which is morphologically stable. AOD slag is generated during the refining process step. It naturally falls to a powder on cooling but can be stabilised, producing a solid crystalline slag. Today, stainless steel slag recovery as aggregates in concrete is increasingly considered. Their interesting mechanical properties make possible their use as replacement for natural aggregates in concrete [1]. These advantages may be lost by the difficulties in guaranteeing volume and chemical stability of these steel slag concretes. 
		 Unlike stainless steel slag, which has only recently been studied, the knowledge of carbon steel slag is more advanced. According to reviews of physicochemical and mineralogical characteristics of carbon steel slag, it can sometimes show dimensional instability due to in the presence of free lime and periclase [3,4,7,8,19-21]. Free lime hydrates quickly but periclase (free MgO) hydrates at a much lower rate, causing significant volume change after months or even years [22]. Steel slag can also contain mineral phases that can cause its disintegration. All these compounds can therefore affect the volume stability and the durability of concretes made of steel slag aggregates. Courard et al. estimate the consequences of the presence of hydrated lime nodules from quicklime on the concrete mechanical characteristics and on the risk of occurrence of pop-out likely to influence concrete durability [23]. To limit these expansive effects, steel slag is left outdoors and exposed to weather for several months, then the slag is crushed to obtain the required size-grading, and later it is sprayed with water for a couple of days in order to allow potential hazardous compounds and high chromium content to leachate. This latter step has not been achieved in this research works because only the coarse fraction of the aggregates (4/20 mm granular size aggregates) is used. Previous tests have shown that Cr-leaching level in slag coarse aggregates is below the authorized limits. Stainless steel slag is different from carbon steel slag by its chemical composition [16]. Stainless steel slags contain, in general, less FeO, more Si[O.sub.2], high contents of Cr and some Ni [15]. Very few studies concern the mineralogical composition of stainless steel slags. Shen et al. and Tossavainen et al. showed that XRD patterns of EAF and AOD samples are very complicated with many species present which makes the mineralogical identification quite difficult [14,16]. They found that stainless EAF slag mainly contains merwinite [Ca.sub.3]Mg[(Si[O.sub.4]).sub.2], bredigite [Ca.sub.14][Mg.sub.2][(Si[O.sub.4]).sub.8], akermanite [Ca.sub.2]Mg[Si.sub.2][O.sub.7] and as minor phases, spinels, dicalcium silicate [Ca.sub.2]Si[O.sub.4] and free CaO [14,16]. Compared with EAF, AOD contains higher CaO but lower Si[O.sub.2]. The mineralogical composition of AOD slag is [gamma]-dicalcium silicate [Ca.sub.2]Si[O.sub.4], fluorite Ca[F.sub.2] and periclase MgO [16,17]. AOD slag naturally disintegrated during the cooling process due to the [beta] to [gamma] dicalcium silicate phase transition [16,17]. 
		 In the current work, stabilisation of AOD prevents it from being disintegrated into powder and solid crystalline rock is obtained. This AOD stabilisation is achieved by adding boron oxide at the time the slag is liquid. To the authors' knowledge, no published study has reported the mineralogical composition of stabilised AOD. Published studies show that free lime and magnesia can be sometimes present [15-17]. Their hydration results in an increased volume of oxides, which can cause, according to their amount and distribution within aggregate grains, a concrete volume change and micro-cracking. The aim of this study is first to undertake careful chemical and mineralogical characterisations of EAF and AOD slags by coupling several analytical techniques. An original approach by UV light is tested to assess the mineralogical variability of slag aggregates. Then the relationships between the presence of mineral phases that could be responsible for slag instability and dimensional change of concrete specimens made with EAF and AOD slags are discussed. 
		 The results of an experimental study about two types of slags from stainless steel processes, EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag, are presented. Firstly, the mineralogical composition of these stainless steel slag aggregates is analysed to verify whether or not they contain mineral phases likely to induce expansive reactions in the concrete. Stainless steel slag aggregates can be characterized by different appearances under ultraviolet light. These aspects depend on mineral phases present in the steel slag aggregates. In this study, this slag aggregate fluorescence is used in combination with usual mineralogical analyses (XRD analyses, SEM observations and EDS analyses). This new approach allows a better representation of mineralogical variability within a slag aggregates sample. Secondly, the natural (silico-calcareous) coarse aggregates of reference concretes are substituted, partially to totally, by EAF slag or stabilised AOD slag coarse aggregates and the concrete linear swellings are measured. The measurement of the longitudinal strain of prismatic specimens stored in water provides comparison of dimensional variations between concretes made of EAF or AOD aggregates and those made of silico-calcareous aggregates. 
		 2. Mineralogical study of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates 
		 Aggregate intrinsic characteristics also depend on their mineralogical nature. To obtain results more representative of the mineralogical variability within a sample of slag aggregates, its fluorescence under UV light is studied and associated with usual mineralogical analyses. 
		 2.1. Materials and methods 
		 In this study, stainless steel slags are left out-door weathering for a couple of months to limit expansive effects due to the presence of free lime and periclase. Then these slags are crushed to obtain 4/20 mm granular size aggregates. Small size aggregates are not used. Apparent specific density of stainless steel slag aggregates tested is 2.8. The water-absorption coefficient of EAF slag aggregates is 2.6 and that of stabilised AOD slag aggregates is 3.0. Analyses of the chemical composition of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag were performed through X-ray fluorescence (Table 1). The free lime content determined in these stainless steel slag aggregates according to EN 1744-1 standard was very low, 0.07% (in CaO equivalent %) in the three different samples that were analysed. 
		 Si[O.sub.2] and CaO are main components (80% of the total chemical composition). The basicity index of the AOD is 2.3 and around 1.3 for EAF slag aggregates. 
		 The mineralogical study was conducted in three steps. 
		 First, mineral phases found in EAF slag and AOD slag aggregates were determined through XRD analyses to get an overview of the minerals present in the aggregates. For this test, five samples were obtained by quartering method and ground to a powder. At this stage, no information was obtained on the proportion of these different mineral phases or their distribution within the aggregates. Moreover, mineral phases in a small proportion cannot be identified by XRD analyses. Samples were scanned with a Philips diffractometer using copper Ka radiation, with 1130/00 generator and 1050/30 goniometer. The wavelength of the incident X-ray was equal to 1.54 [Angstrom]. The diffractometer was running at 40 kV and 20 mA. The step widths were 0.025[degrees] from 6 to 66[degrees] 2-theta and 0.0025[degrees] from 64 to 70[degrees] 2-theta. The counting time was 1.5 s per step. 
		 Second, the mineralogical variability of EAF and stabilised AOD slag aggregates was studied. For this, a new approach was proposed. It consisted of using the fluorescence by UV light of these steel slag aggregates to separate them into groups with similar mineralogical properties. This test was realised with two wavelengths (254 nm and 365 nm) and provided a mapping of slag aggregate mineralogical variations at a larger scale than was possible with the usual chemical and mineralogical analyses. Concretes made of these steel slags were used for this test. Concrete cylinders (160 x 320 mm) were split in order to provide the slag aggregate for fresh sections. 
		 Finally, for each identified aggregates group, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were performed, coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). These analyses were based on a D (p, z) method to correct for matrix effect. The aim of this step was to determine specific mineral phases of the grains of same aggregates group. Five grains were analysed for each group. Sample preparation consisted of vacuum impregnation in resin, polishing and conductive surface coating. For SEM observations, the measurement device was a LEICA S340i model with a 20 kV accelerating voltage. A Bruker's Quantax X-ray energy dispersive (EDS) detector (active area of 10 [mm.sup.2] delivering 129 eV) was also used for chemical analysis. The spectra were collected at signal intensity from 15,000 to 20,000 cps, 10% dead time. Polished samples were evaluated using a backscatter detector. The size of the mineral phases and their distribution within the steel slag aggregates were observed. Relationships between mineral aggregate composition and UV fluorescence colours were proposed. 
		 2.2. X-ray diffraction analyses of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates 
		 XRD patterns of EAF slag aggregates are very complex and show significant variability between samples. Fig. 1 presents three representative XRD patterns obtained on different samples. Several overlapping peaks resulting from the main present minerals can be observed. X-ray diffraction analyses show that all EAF slag samples contain akermanite [Ca.sub.2]Mg([Si.sub.2][O.sub.7]). Some of them also contain several other silicates (merwinite [Ca.sub.3]Mg[(Si[O.sub.4]).sub.2], andratite [Ca.sub.3][Al.sub.2]Fe[Si.sub.3][O.sub.12], cuspidine [Ca.sub.4][Si.sub.2][O.sub.7][F.sub.2], rankinite [Ca.sub.3][Si.sub.2][O.sub.7]) and some metallic oxides (chromium spinels Mg[Cr.sub.2][O.sub.4], perovskite CaTi[O.sub.3]). Instable mineral phases such as free lime and periclase are not found in these EAF slag aggregates. 
		 The mineralogical composition of stabilised AOD samples is different from that of EAF samples. Fig. 2 gives two examples of XRD patterns obtained on two different samples. XRD patterns of stabilised AOD slag aggregates show less variety of minerals. The main identified mineral phases are dicalcium silicates [beta]-[Ca.sub.2]Si[O.sub.4] (larnite), fluorite Ca[F.sub.2] and periclase MgO. Free lime is not found. The X-ray spectrum line intensities of the Ca[F.sub.2] and MgO vary from one sample to another. Other low intensity diffraction lines are also visible. They match with the calcium borosilicate CanSI4B2022 and the tricalcium silicate [Ca.sub.2]Si[O.sub.5] (hatrurite). The orthorhombic form of dicalcium silicate ([gamma]-[Ca.sub.2]Si[O.sub.4]) is not observed, showing the good stability of larnite. 
		 XRD patterns show significant heterogeneity between the different samples, in particular for EAF slag. This demonstrates the difficulty in obtaining representative samples for usual mineralogical analyses and justifies the use of slag aggregate UV fluorescence in this study. 
		 2.3. Identification of aggregate's groups according to their fluorescence under UV light 
		 Concrete specimens (300 mm x 150 mm diameter) made of EAF slag and AOD slag coarse aggregates were split into two halves in order to get fresh sections. A compression load is applied diametrically and uniformly along the length of cylinder until the failure along the vertical diameter. Failure planes of these concrete specimen halves are put under lamps producing long and short waves (Fig. 3). The aggregates grains are separated into different groups according to their fluorescence. 
		 Compared with the crossed-polarized light imaging, this method based on UV light exposure does not require prior sample preparation and therefore no use of thin-sections. UV light method can analyse in a short time a large sample surface. The results summarized in Table 2 show that these slag aggregates have different aspects under UV light. The results highlight the mineralogical variability of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates because UV fluorescence depends on mineral phases. Most of EAF slag aggregates do not change their colour (EAF-group 1) under ultraviolet light (80%). The shining ones represent less than 15% of the aggregates visible on the surface of the concrete specimen and have an orange colour under short UV light (EAF-group 2) (Fig. 3b). A very small amount of EAF slag aggregate glows purple under short and long UV lights (EAF-group 3). For stabilised AOD slag aggregates, many appear in orange (AOD-group 1). Under long UV light, some aggregates glow in the purple (AOD-group 2) or in the blue colour range (AOD-group 3) (Fig. 3-d). The aspect under UV light is not correlated with the grains dimension. The various proportions (expressed in number particles) are obtained by manual counting and are an average on several samples. 
		 2.4. Scanning electron microscopy observations and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates 
		 The aim of SEM-EDS analyses is first to determine the mineral phases that form the different grain's aggregate groups identified by fluorescence under long and short UV light (Table 2) and second to propose a relationship between aggregate mineral composition and UV fluorescence colours. This allows for an overall quantitative approach of aggregate mineralogical variations in a concrete specimen. 
		 Based on elemental mapping and semi-quantitative elemental analyses (SEM-EDS), the chemical composition of each mineral phase can be obtained for each aggregate's group. All of them except Ca-S phase were confirmed by XRD analyses (Figs. 1 and 2). Figs. 4 and 5 show representative examples of elemental mapping and the identified mineral phases for each aggregate's group. Each group is characterized by specific mineral phases. EAF slag aggregates that do not fluoresce (EAF-groupl) contain mainly melilite, merwinite, perovskite and rankinite. Those that have orange colours under short wave UV light (EAF-group 2) may be assigned to cuspidine because this mineral phase is only identified in aggregates of group 2 [23,25]. The presence of chromium spinels in aggregates of EAF-group 3 can explain the purple colour under UV of the grains of these slag's aggregates. For stabilised AOD slag (Fig. 5), the main mineral phase is dicalcium silicate. Periclase (MgO) and fluorite are minority phases enclosed in a dicalcium silicate matrix. The size of the periclase is about 5 [micro] and that of the fluorite can reach 90 [micro] depending on the aggregates. These phases are present in all aggregate groups identified by UV fluorescence. The chromium spinels (elongated shape) and Ca-S phase are mainly observed in the aggregates of AOD-group 2. The different colours under UV lamps can be explained by the proportion or the size of these mineral phases. Thus, orange colour under UV lamps of AOD slag aggregates (AOD-group 1) could be assigned to beta-dicalcium silicate ([beta]-[Ca.sub.2]Si[O.sub.4]), and blue colour (AOD-group 3) to fluorite Ca[F.sub.2] [24,26]. However, it remains an uncertainty because fluorite can appear in several colours under UV lamps according to its impurities. The purple colour under UV light of some grains (AOD-group 2) may also be attributed to the presence of chromium spinels. 
		 Overall, the different analytical techniques have shown the very small amount of mineral phases which could lead to expansive reactions. Even if determined in very small amount in EAF and AOD slag by X-ray fluorescence analysis, free lime is not observed in the steel slag aggregates neither through X-ray diffraction, nor by SEM- EDS analyses. MgO is observed in the AOD slag aggregates through X-ray diffraction (periclase) and SEM-EDS analyses. MgO is not detected in EAF slag aggregates. In these EAF slag aggregates, the magnesium is entirely integrated in crystalline mineral phases (akermanite, merwinite and spinels). The mineralogical analyses did not reveal the presence of Mg(C[O.sub.3]) or Mg[(OH).sub.2]. The periclase seems well encapsulated in the slag because it did not react with air humidity or C[O.sub.2] despite the exposure of the slag to weather for several months. The beta dicalcium silicate present in AOD slag seems stable. Its gamma phase is not observed by XRD analysis. 
		 3. Dimensional stability of concretes made of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates 
		 3.1. Concrete mix design 
		 In this part of the study, all or part of the silico-calcareous coarse aggregates of a reference concrete was replaced by stainless steel slag coarse aggregates. Five types of high-strength concrete are designed based on the following ratio: water to cement ratio of 0.3, a coarse to fine aggregates volume ratio of 0.62 and a cement amount of 500 kg/[m.sup.3]. They differ in their composition in coarse aggregates. One concrete contains only silico-calcareous aggregates (SC, reference concrete), two concretes are composed of 50% in volume percent of silico-calcareous aggregates and 50% of stainless steel slag aggregates (EAF slag or stabilised AOD slag); the last two concretes are made of 100% of stainless steel slag aggregates (EAF slag or stabilised AOD slag). The volume of aggregates remains the same from one concrete to another. The mixing water is determined by considering the water content in aggregates and the water provided by the superplasticiser. The different concretes are in S4 consistency class (EN 206 standard) and the amount of superplasticiser varies from one mix concrete to another in order to keep the same slump. The modified polycarboxylate-based superplasticiser (cimfluid 3002) is used. The mix proportions of these concretes are presented in Table 3. For fine aggregates, only silico-calcareous aggregates are used. Their water absorption is lower than that of silico-calcareous coarse aggregates and is estimated at 1%. The binder is Portland cement CEM I 52.5 R. 365-days compressive strengths of these concretes vary from 74 MPa to 77 MPa and their E-modulus from 49 GPa to 57 GPa (Table 3). 
		 3.2. Concrete swelling test 
		 To determine whether any expansion occurred, length measurements of concrete prisms are carried out at 28, 90 and 365 days. The tests consist of measuring longitudinal deformations of concrete prism specimen (70 x 70 x 280 mm) stored in saturated-lime water at 20 [degrees]C during one year. The aim of these tests was to compare the behaviour of different types of concrete at this temperature. Additional tests at a higher temperature (60 [degrees]C) are surely necessary to provide concrete long-term expansion values to accelerating expansive reactions. Reference stainless steel studs are cast into the mid-points of the top and bottom faces of the prisms. An invar rod is used to calibrate the length of the measurement apparatus. For each measurement, the prism is kept in the same position (top and bottom position, the same prism face towards the apparatus). For each mixture, three concrete prisms are used. The initial length is taken on 24-h-aged concrete samples. 
		 Fig. 6 shows the expansion curve of EAF slag and stabilised AOD slag aggregates concretes during 365 days. Each value is the average of three measurements on three different prismatic specimens. The results indicate autogenous shrinkage at 28 days for concretes with EAF slag aggregates and also for concretes with silico-calcareous aggregates. This shrinkage results from the chemical combination of the cement during hydration because water is internally removed from the capillary pores and is mostly important in high strength concretes, due to their low w/c ratio. This shrinkage is not observed for concrete made with stabilised AOD slag aggregates. Since aggregate volume, water to cement ratio and cement are the same for all concrete mixes, the differences of strain may come from the aggregate nature. After one year, the concretes made of stainless steel slag aggregates show more expansion than that of concretes made of silico-calcareous aggregates: 0.017% for concretes with EAF slag aggregates and 0.026% for concretes made of stabilised AOD slag aggregates, against 0. 008. for concrete made of silico-calcareous aggregates. These values are consistent with the expansion of concretes made of nonreactive alkali aggregates (from 0.01% to 0.03% at one year for concrete specimen stored in saturated-lime water at 20 [degrees]C) [25]. The expansion increases with the volume fraction of stainless steel slag coarse aggregates. 
		 After 28 days, the elongation rate is the same for all concretes. Therefore, the differences in the concrete expansions occur before 28 days. The reduction or elimination of 28-days shrinkage could be explained by swelling phenomenon offsetting the autogenous shrinkage. XRD analyses did not show the presence of glassy phases in slags so that the expansion cannot result from alkali-silica reaction. No ettringite is determined in SEM observations either. Consequently, additional dimensional change could be related to some hydration reactions with free lime or free MgO. The highest expansion values are measured on concrete made of AOD slag aggregates. It is consistent with chemical and mineralogical analyses which highlighted free MgO for this steel slag. However, XRD analyses conducted on AOD slag aggregates kept for a year in water did not indicate the presence of Mg[(OH).sub.2]. The amount of Mg[(OH).sub.2] formed is probably not sufficient to be detected. 
		 4. Conclusions 
		 From the investigations carried out in this study, the following conclusions are drawn: 
		 1. An innovative approach (UV fluorescence of slag aggregates) can be coupled with traditional methods to characterize the mineralogy of slag aggregate. This approach helps to classify the aggregates in homogeneous groups for the further mineralogical characterisation. 
		 2. UV light method is a very simple test and can analyse in a short time a large sample surface (several hundred of [cm.sup.2]). Preparation of samples is much faster and easier than for crossed polarized light imaging. 
		 3. Most of EAF slag aggregates do not change their colour (EAF-group 1) under ultraviolet light (80%) while the majority of stabilised AOD slag aggregates appear in orange. 
		 4. EAF slag aggregates mainly contain some silicates (akermanite, merwinite, andratite, rankinite) and oxides (chromium spinels, perovskite). Cuspidine is present in 15% of the grains of EAF slag aggregate which fluoresce orange under short wave UV. EAF slag aggregates which have purple colour under UV light mainly contain chromium spinels. 
		 5. Stabilised AOD slag aggregates mainly contain beta-dicalcium silicate and, in various proportions, minor phases such as fluorite and periclase. Gamma phase of dicalcium silicate is not detected. Orange colour under UV light of AOD slag aggregates could be assigned to beta-dicalcium silicate and blue colour under UV light to fluorite Ca[F.sub.2]. 
		 6. The content in mineral phases likely to cause an expansive reaction (free CaO or free MgO) is very low. Free MgO is not observed in EAF slag aggregates. 
		 7. The linear expansion of concrete samples stored in saturated-lime water at 20 [degrees]C increases with the substitution rate of silico-calcareous aggregates by slag aggregates. This is particularly observed with AOD slag aggregates. 
		 HIGHLIGHTS 
		 * UV fluorescence of EAF and AOD slag can help their mineralogical characterisation. 
		 * Cuspidine is present in EAF aggregates which fluoresce orange under short wave UV. 
		 * Beta-dicalcium silicate is the main mineral phase of stabilised AOD aggregates. 
		 * AOD slag aggregates contain mineral phases which can show expansive reactions. 
		 * The use of EAF and AOD aggregates can slightly increase the concrete linear expansion.

		The French state has always prided itself on its special relationship with culture. But in recent years its powerful culture ministry seems to have lost its way 
		 One of the enduring characteristics of French life, both in perceptions from outside and self-perceptions within, is a special, state-level relationship with culture, embodied by its culture ministry, which was born under Charles de Gaulle in 1959 and led for its first decade by the enigmatic and visionary Andre Malraux. Today, France is a country with generous support structures for out-of-work artists, or intermittents du spectacle. It has a long history of state investment in the arts, is home to some of the most-visited museums in the world, and possesses some beautifully maintained heritage monuments. For decades it has had robust legal protections in place to safeguard independent bookshops and publishers against the discounting wars of large supermarket chains and, more recently, Amazon. It has an annual investment scheme for home-grown independent films. But lately the proud image projected by the ministry located in rue de Valois, two steps from the Palais Royal and Comedie Francaise, has come under intense scrutiny and its spirit, ambitions, and role have been called into question.
		'I have no problem admitting that for two years I have had absolutely no time to read. I read lots of notes, lots of legal texts, the news, AFP wire stories. But I read very little.' This candid statement from Fleur Pellerin was the last in a run of faux pas during her time as culture minister, from 2014 until February this year, in Francois Hollande's government. Pellerin was trying to explain away her earlier inability to cite a single work by French writer Patrick Modiano after he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. For many, such a lapse had uncomfortable echoes of Nicolas Sarkozy, who had declared when he was president that he had not enjoyed La Princesse de Cleves, the 17th-century novel by Madame de Lafayette that is a favourite of many intellectuals in France, most vocally Alain Finkielkraut, and a staple on school reading lists. The Enlightenment demand that politicians master the classics and embrace the arts is still powerful in France and the comment turned Sarkozy, by his own admission, into 'a symbol of "no culture'". He has sought to redeem himself ever since and, in La France pour tous, his latest book written with an eye on the 2017 presidential elections, Sarkozy has rebranded himself as a veritable culture vulture. 
		 In criticising La Princesse de Cleves, Sarkozy was questioning something more profound: the inclusion of such a text on school reading lists, with the aim to democratise high art by having children around the country read and discuss it. This, in essence, is the spirit of culture pour chacun (culture for everyone), which was a term in official use by the culture ministry in the 2000s but was, in rather different form, an underpinning philosophy of Malraux's culture ministry. 'The ministry in charge of cultural affairs,' said its founding decree in 1959, 'has the role of making available vital works from humanity, and initially from France, to the greatest possible number of French people, of ensuring the largest audience for our cultural heritage, and of supporting the creation of the spirit and works of art which enrich it.' 
		 Since Malraux, culture pour chacun has been interpreted differently by various ministers during the democratising push of the 1970s and the '80s, most notably by the charismatic and energetic showman Jack Lang, who served twice as culture minister during the presidency of Frangois Mitterrand. Subsequent ministers, such as Frederic Mitterrand (nephew of Frangois) during Sarkozy's term, have been under greater pressure to generate revenue at the same time as sharing culture. 
		 Looking at the French culture ministry from the perspective of culture pour chacun reveals how the debate over the democratisation of the arts has evolved: an initially top-down approach now encompasses questions about inclusiveness and diversity. The deeper question here is whether this change has affected the creation of art, and our understanding of it in all its forms. This includes questions about the role and value of the popular arts in France--cartoons or bandes dessinees-, the film industry's regular production of crowd-pleasing comedies, and the chanson frangaise as embodied by Georges Brassens or Boris Vian, and by its contemporary incarnations Jean-Jacques Goldman or Marc Lavoine. 
		 Jacques Duhamel, for instance, culture minister (1971-73) in Jacques Chaban-Delmas's government, was animated by this premier's New Society ambitions to promote the integration of minorities. Duhamel tried to modernise cultural policy with an increased departmental budget and by drawing on local government. Rather than disseminate the pearls of France's historic artists and writers to all, the focus instead was to bring out from the margins other kinds of culture, and absorb these new influences into the centre. 
		 In 1977 the role of Mayor of Paris was reestablished after a near century-long hiatus since the Third Republic. Breezing through the door was a youthful, chain-smoking Jacques Chirac. The change hinted at greater decentralisation and regional autonomy, but in concrete terms the culture ministry did not delegate many of its powers to the mayor. The biggest boost to decentralisation has come more recently, in the 2000s, with the passing of legislation that allows the ministry to share the financing of institutions with regions or departments. This has produced new hybrid institutions outside Paris, such as the Pompidou-Metz (2010), and Louvre-Lens (2013). 
		 Andre Malraux was an art historian before he was a minister, and had little love for bureaucracy and administration. The relationship of art to society had been on his mind long before he entered the government. In a speech in 1945 to the Constituent Assembly he urged democratisation: 'It seems to me indispensable that French culture stops being the privilege of people who are lucky enough to live in Paris or are rich.' But democratisation in Malraux's terms was about improved distribution of the goods, not a commentary or judgement on the goods themselves. Culture, in his mind, represented the highest and most lasting forms of artistic achievement; art was an outcome of humanity's unending struggle against the human condition. 
		 Malraux was passionate about art, and at times wildly egotistical. After his series of novels in the 1930s, including La Condition humaine, he published major tomes such as Psychologie de L'Art (1947-49) and Le Musee imaginaire de la sculpture mondiale (1952-54), both of which have influenced Jean-Luc Godard in his lifelong investigation of a visual, poetic approach to cinema. By Malraux's own admission there were always two people when he worked for the government: one an original thinker and figurehead; the other very loosely in charge of the day-to-day running of an administration. He never embraced the latter role and his most popular and enduring legacy as minister has been his conservationist policies--homages to the past: the wholesale cleaning and restoration of historical monuments such as the Louvre and Versailles, and the 'Loi Malraux' in 1962, which safeguarded whole districts of historical and architectural significance from modern development or change. 
		 Nevertheless, Malraux instituted the still-active avance sur recettes scheme, a system of selective aid to new French films, often by untried directors, which is still in place today. He also revived a neglected tradition of state commissions, which led to some bold new partnerships at times, including Marc Chagall being invited to paint the ceiling of the Paris Opera, and promising commissions offered to Le Corbusier, Jean Cocteau, and Georges Braque (though all died before these could be completed). 
		 Ultimately, there was a mystical quality to Malraux's leadership--he spoke in lofty, inspirational terms about culture. When he was fired in 1969--after firing the revered Henri Langlois at the Cinematheque the previous year--the ministry was still the skeleton department it had been set up as in 1959. He presided over a modest 377 staff at rue de Valois and on average culture received 0.39 per cent as a share of the state's budget throughout the 1960s. As the historian David Looseley has put it, 'that the Ministry managed to survive to become as important as it is today was therefore the result not of ministerial drive or of a winning and timely formula being devised at the outset, but of an unpromising empty vessel being subsequently filled'. In the years after Malraux the budget has crept up, increasing from 2.6 billion francs in 1981 to 13.8 billion in 1993--Today, it is 7.3 billion [euro]. 
		 In its early days, the ministry did not dedicate much of its resources and attention to museums. Under subsequent ministers, however, national museums underwent intense development. New buildings were built, financing increased, and every president since Georges Pompidou in the 1970s has sought to develop his own museum project as a way of leaving a cultural legacy. In this sense, museums in France represent broader issues such as inclusiveness and how France deals with its minorities, past and present. An open, popular, vibrant museum culture is now considered emblematic of a broader social atmosphere. 
		 There are some 37 national museums across the country, the most famous in the Paris region such as Versailles, Orsay, and the Pompidou. These are all under the tutelage of the culture ministry, though some may eventually be looked after by a different ministry. They hold national collections and are mostly dedicated to the beaux-arts and have been progressively detached from centralised management. In the 1990s the Louvre and Versailles were granted the status of 'autonomous state establishment', which gave them responsibility for their own budgets and profits. This encouraged the seeking of private funding and expansion activities that would generate income, known as a politique de l'offre--incorporating shops and cafes into the museum space and holding events. Private input into French public institutions has always been rather modest, but in the 2000s a series of laws were passed that increased tax incentives for companies to become patrons of national museums. 
		 Jack Lang's appointment in 1981 is, with hindsight, the most decisive in shaping the form the culture ministry has taken today. Lang's years in charge were memorable, colourful, and divisive. He combined flair in front of the cameras, a love of the media spotlight, political savvy, and an apparently genuine dedication to raising the status of culture and defending both its independent and commercial sectors. The annual Fete de la Musique, which he introduced in 1982 and has since gone worldwide, is typical of Lang's policies: exuberant, high-profile, and crowd-pleasing, but also providing a real boost to creativity and its free expression. He also left behind a highly visible legacy, having presided over Frangois Mitterrand's Grands Travaux (great works)--all in Paris--of the Bibliotheque nationale, the new Louvre pyramid, the Institut du Monde Arabe, Opera Bastille, <meronyme id="2029">the Grande Arche</meronyme> at <mention id="2030">La Defense</mention> and, at La Villette, the City of Science and Music. 
		 Lang's impact on culture in France at the level of state policy persists today, most notably in his first bill when he abolished the 1979 'arrete Monory', which freed books pricing from their fixed cover price and replaced it with the prix unique du livre, requiring all booksellers and other sales outlets to respect a mandatory single pricing system. This has since provided robust protection to independent publishers and bookshops and ensured France retains a comparatively healthy book culture, both for authors and readers. 
		 On the flipside, another long-lasting change introduced in the Lang era was the 198s decree, pushed through by Mitterrand on the eve of a possible government cohabitation with the centre-right republican party. The ruling significantly extended the powers of nomination held by the French president, notably in the cultural sphere. The head of state, on the advice of the culture ministry, is now able to decide on a wide-ranging number of key cultural posts, including the administrator of the Comedie Franqaise, the presidents of the administrative councils at the Opera Paris and Bastille, the presidents of the Centre Pompidou, the Centre national du Cinema, the Institut de l'audiovisuel, and many more. Consequently, culture in France expresses, in the words of the French historian Antoine de Baecque, 'the majesty of power and the glory of the sovereign'. 
		 The government's enormous powers of appointment in the cultural sphere have provoked a number of controversies but no modification to the procedure. 'This monarchical tradition is insupportable, even if those brought in are great artists and top professionals,' said Greg Germain, the director of the fringe Off section at the important annual Avignon festival, after the controversial replacement of Olivier Py by Luc Bondy at the Theatre de l'Odeon in 2012. For Valerie de Saint-Do, historian of the ties between politics and the arts, and a journalist at Cassandre/Horschamp, 'the issue of nominations has been the most ridiculous and scandalous aspect of the last government, but it's the tree that hides the forest [...] the system reduces cultural politics to a game of individual career-building.' 
		 One of the most high-profile dismissals by the culture ministry operating in this monarchical mode took place two years ago at the prestigious Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-Arts. The curator, art critic, and formalist theoretician Nicolas Bourriaud took over as director in 2009 and led the school through an energetic period of development which involved strengthening its international ties with global art institutions and boosting the number of foreign students. These changes are all said to have been factors in the decision to fire him in July 2015. His replacement was so swift that even months later, Bourriaud said that he still struggled to believe it was for real. Eric de Chassey from the Villa Medici was appointed in his place within weeks. There was gossip surrounding the choice, given de Chassey's connection to Hollande's partner Julie Gayet (de Chassey's wife, the actress Anne Consigny, is a close friend of Gayet's). The more substantial criticisms focused on how quick and opaque the whole process had been: candidates were given from 2-21 July to apply, allowing barely enough time to put together a serious application for such a position. 
		 There were many who supported Bourriaud and were especially critical of the undemocratic way he had been pushed out. But others have remained reticent over his legacy at the ENSBA. During his time there he opened its doors to outside sponsors and, for his detractors, set the school on the track of commercialisation. Bourriaud's defence is pragmatic: 'One cannot reproach me [for commercialization] while at the same time taking away 800,000 [euro] of my budget compared to 2012,' he explained to Mediapart. I' cannot make cuts in education or reduce the activities of the school, because our pedagogical model includes heritage, collections, and exhibitions. Therefore, 1 had to find money from outside, and I was able to bring to the centre of the school the role of the sponsors.' Bourriaud's dilemma is one all art schools and institutions face: are businesses really a benign influence when they become investors in culture? Do corporate sponsors necessarily change the nature of an institution? By firing a director like Bourriaud who was willing to take the pragmatic approach, the culture ministry seemed to be admitting that it has no clear response to the challenges that institutions face. 
		 A few scenes from the Pellerin era capture what is a particularly low period for the ministry. The disturbing aspect of the latest upheavals is not that Pellerin is an embarrassment to France's sturdy defence of culture and its proud contemporary output. To frame the situation this way is to indulge the myth that Pellerin, like Sarkozy, is an aberration in regards to France's special relationship with culture, represented by its culture ministry. We should remember that Hollande replaced Pellerin with Audrey Azoulay--one of her classmates from the civil-servant school ENA--not for her indifference to culture, but because he realised she was 'damaged goods' in the cultural milieu and that her public missteps could harm his own 2017 re-election bid. The previous culture minister in Hollande's government, Aurelie Filippetti, had cut the budget by a startling 30.2 per cent and when Hollande began his presidency in 2012, he had made his position clear, declaring: 'culture is no longer a state priority'. 
		 When Pellerin was appointed, the France 3 documentary Un temps de president showed Hollande breezily advising his young minister in front of the cameras to take inspiration from the talisman of the 1980s. 'Lang's strength was his ideas! He had ideas. You need ideas. See Jack! That's the first meeting you should have, with Jack! [...] Go to shows every night. You've got to do the theatre.' When Pellerin lost her job, she came to realise that perhaps her primary failure had been to fail to take those words seriously. T thought it was a joke but in fact it was my road map.' Her indifference to playing the game of appearing cultivated was her undoing, and makes her oddly admirable. 
		 In her ministerial office in front of the Canal Plus cameras, Pellerin was open about how alien these surroundings were to her she could not turn on the television, there were piles of unopened letters, she picked up objects she had never seen before. Who was the artist of the huge tableau on the wall? 'No idea,' she replied. This kind of scene sums up the French culture ministry today. The budget and subsidies are still comparatively higher than those allocated in other countries, many of which lump 'culture' in with other sectors, such as the odd combination of 'culture, media and sport' in Britain. But aside from the positive policies put in place by previous, more ambitious and visionary ministers, the role now is more easily reduced to that of providing a high-profile recipient for invitations to openings of new exhibitions or plays. 
		 'It's all a decor,' Pellerin said in another moment of candour, about the trappings of her ministerial office. 'It's for you the journalists.' Grimly, we can agree with her on that. The most important quality for the minister walking into the offices on rue de Valois today is the ability to pretend that he or she cares about culture. The role of the ministry is now a function--distributing subsidies, organising parties, being seen to go to the theatre --rather than a job. But to do more than that, even to have some ideas, is not a priority, nor even desirable, if those ideas cost money. For now, the special relationship with culture on which France prides itself is maintained and renewed only by its artists. The state's belief in its intangible and intrinsic value is in sharp retreat.

		 ABSTRACT 
		 Bitumen has been known to be prone to chemical ageing from the very beginning of its modern use in road construction. It is now well accepted that this results in chemical changes illustrated in particular by an increase in asphaltenes content and in the quantity of functional groups such as sulfoxides and carbonyls. The rheological consequences are a global hardening and embrittlement. However, the role of other potential ingredients of asphalt mixtures on bitumen oxidation kinetics remain poorly documented. If hydrated lime has been observed to reduce ageing for more than 40 years, the role of other mineral fillers is not so clear. Part of the problem comes from the difficulty to use the current standard ageing procedures for bitumen when it comes to mastics (blends of bitumen and filler). The viscosity increase due to the presence of filler decreases the severity of the ageing process in rotating methods such as the celebrated Roiling Thin Film Oven Test (RTFOT). Therefore, we developed a simple procedure based on the existing Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) and on published equivalence between RTFOT and PAV. This makes it possible to easily quantify the effect of mineral fillers through an increase in ring and ball softening temperature, independent of the viscosity increase due to the filler. Using this method, it is shown that hydrated lime slows down bitumen ageing more than other less active fillers such as hydraulic lime or Portland cement, and that mineral fillers from crushed limestone or granitic aggregate have no effect on bitumen ageing.

		 1. Introduction 
		 Bitumen has been known to be prone to chemical ageing from the very beginning of its modern use in road construction. As a matter of fact, Joseph Nicephore Niepce made some of the very first recorded photographs in the early 1820s by exposing a solution of Dead Sea bitumen to light. This procedure created insoluble compounds that could not be washed away and remained as part of the picture [1]. However, the technology did not prevail and industrial use of bitumen ageing capabilities really developed some years later with the advent of modern refining technologies [2], It was widely known at the turn of the 20th Century that a combination of high temperature and exposure to air flow could harden a soft bitumen base. This evolved into the modern air-blowing process which was already widespread in 1920 [3], Today, air-blowing remains a key technology especially for the manufacturing of industrial grades of bitumen generally known as air-blown or oxidized bitumen [4,5]. 
		 In parallel, the age-hardening of bitumen upon outdoor exposure was noticed by the road industry at the very beginning of asphalt paving. It had raised sufficient attention for researchers to set-up accelerated ageing methods as early as 1897 [6] and was already presented as a well-known fact in 1913 [7]. It was then recognized that most of the hardening developed due to oxidation rather than mass loss [7). Standard test methods started to be adopted in the 1940s with the development of the Thin Film Oven Test (TFOT--[8,9]). The test consists in ageing 3.2-mm thick bitumen films in an oven for 5 h at 163 [degrees]C. It entered the US paving grade specifications in 1955. Still, the TFOT was later surpassed by the Rolling Thin Film Oven Test (RTFOT--ASTM D2872--EN 12607), which developed in the early 1960s [10] and "cooks" the binder in 1.25-mm thick rotating films at 163 [degrees]C for 75 min. RTFOT is now the preferred standard method in the US and in Europe to simulate the ageing occurring in the asphalt mixing plant [6], It leads typically to a doubling of the viscosity of the tested material, although the extent of hardening is bitumen-dependent and ranges typically between 1.5 and 4 for the viscosity at 60 [degrees]C [11], In the meantime, the asphaltenes content typically increases by 1-4 wt % [12,13]. Note that the ratio of the viscosity (or any other rheological indicator) after to that before ageing is generally called the "Ageing Index". 
		 Nowadays, two ageing conditions are generally separated for bitumen characterization [5,14], First, there is the rapid chemical ageing that takes place upon mixing thin films of hot bitumen with the hot aggregate. Second, an in-situ ageing also develops throughout the service life of the pavement. 
		 The first one, also called short-term ageing, occurs for a short time at a high temperature of typically 160 [degrees]C, corresponding to the standard conditions in mixing plants [6]. These are the conditions that are mimicked in the RTFOT. 
		 The second one, sometimes called long-term ageing, occurs for a much longer period of time since service life of the pavement can extend to several decades. It depends of course on the position of the bitumen inside the pavement, the top layers being more exposed than the base course. Mix formulation also comes into play, the bitumen thickness and the mix porosity being important parameters [15], It finally depends on the local climate and all these involved parameters make it quite complicated to accurately describe in-situ ageing [15-17], Simulation of in-situ ageing is therefore more difficult and a widely used testing procedure, the Pressure Ageing Vessel Test (PAV--ASTM D6521--EN 14769), consists in conditioning binders in 3.2-mm thick films for 20 h at 100[degrees]C under an air pressure of 2.07 MPa. This procedure was initially shown to reproduce satisfactorily the in-situ ageing of bitumen in surface courses for approximately 4-8 years in locations such as Wyoming and Florida [18], More recent evidence tends to show that the equivalence between PAV and in-situ field ageing depends on local conditions. For example, a Swedish study showed that 10-years old field specimens aged less than the neat bitumen after RTFOT + PAV [19] but in parallel, a US study proved that specimens after 8 years in Arizona and Virginia were more severely aged than after the usual RTFOT + PAV procedure [16], 
		 Still, and even if bitumen ageing has clearly been studied for decades, the exact chemical mechanisms at play remain debated [15,20,21]. Also, recent works on the impact of additives such as polymers [22], polyphosphoric acids [23], organo-clays [24] or flame-retardants [25] maintain bitumen ageing as a vivid research field. 
		 In this context, it comes as a surprise to see that the effect of minerals on bitumen ageing as received only limited attention. In fact, and as detailed in the background section, some works tend to show that minerals have no effect on bitumen ageing, except for so-called active fillers such as hydrated lime whose beneficial effect has always been recognized, when other works show that limestone or siliceous filler do reduce bitumen ageing. In this paper, we discuss that this controversy probably comes from the way the ageing was studied, in particular when ageing tests sensitive to binder viscosity have been used, such as the RTFOT. Then, we propose to use instead a modified PAV-procedure and show that it gives reasonable data confirming that active fillers do reduce bitumen ageing but minerals filler from crushed rock or gravel have no such effect. 
		 2. Background 
		 As rapidly stated in the introduction, there are some contradictions in the literature regarding the effect of minerals on the ageing of bitumen. 
		 2.1. Effect of hydrated lime on bitumen ageing 
		 The fact that hydrated lime slows down bitumen ageing was first highlighted in Utah at the beginning of the 1970s. Bitumens extracted from recovered field specimens of asphalt mixtures containing hydrated lime, were observed to have a significantly lower viscosity than the reference ones [26]. Now, many studies confirmed this finding and it is now widely documented that hydrated lime slows down bitumen ageing [15,28]. The effect was fully developed with hydrated lime contents as low as 10 wt% based on the mastic [28]. Note that no concentration below this value has ever been tested to our knowledge and it must therefore not be interpreted as the minimum amount necessary to obtain an improved resistance to ageing. 
		 The improved ageing resistance was materialized by a reduced increase in asphaltenes content with hydrated lime-modified than with non-modified bitumens [27-29,19,30]. Reasons for that are linked to acid-base reactions between polar molecules of the bitumen and the lime surface [15,28,31]. In parallel, Mg[(OH).sub.2], a weaker base than Ca[(OH).sub.2] (hydrated lime), was not seen to reduce bitumen ageing [32], when CaO (quicklime) [29] and dolomitic hydrated lime Mg[(OH).sub.2] x Ca[(OH).sub.2] [28] were seen to be active. This suggests that it takes a strong base for this mechanism to develop. 
		 Still, acid-base neutralizations are not sufficient to explain the whole chemical interactions at stakes. Western Research Institute researchers proposed that hydrated lime acts as an inhibitor for the oxidation catalysts naturally present in the bitumen [15,28], This was in part validated by Johansson et al., who showed that the catalytic effect of vanadium compounds on bitumen ageing was decreased in the presence of hydrated lime, although they could not highlight any specific vanadium--hydrated lime interactions [32]. As a result, the main reason why a strong base such as hydrated lime impacts between ageing, is thought to be linked to the concentration of polar molecules from the bitumen on its surface. This prevents them from further reacting. Since they are especially prone to ageing, their removal generates an overall slower ageing kinetics. 
		 However, some startling results were observed using the Rotating Cylinder Asphalt Test (RCAT--[14,19]). The test was performed either at 163 [degrees]C for 235 min (with a rotation speed of 5 rpm and an airflow of 4.0 L/min of air) or at 90 [degrees]C for 140 h (with a rotation speed of 1 rpm and an airflow of 4.5 L/hr. Mastics with four bitumens and 30 vol% limestone or mixed filler (limestone containing 25 wt% hydrated lime) were studied before and after ageing [19]. The effect of hydrated lime was seen to be dependent on bitumen paving grade, the harder grades being less affected than the softer ones based on rheological indicators, although Fourier-Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR) demonstrated that the lower carbonyl rate was always present even for materials whose age hardening was essentially unchanged. The authors were clearly surprised by these unexpected results (i.e., no reduction of the age hardening due to lime addition when lower carbonyl rate was observed) although no explanation of their findings could be given. 
		 2.2. Effect of other mineral fillers on bitumen ageing 
		 If the case for hydrated lime is well documented, the effect of other minerals remains controversial. Pioneering works by Petersen and coworkers [33] based on the ageing of thin films of material on mineral surfaces, showed that although minerals such as quartzite and limestone could catalyse the oxidation of bitumen lighter components (i.e. saturates and aromatics, see [5] for a detailed description of bitumen structure and composition), the effect was negligible when the heavier fractions (resins and asphaltenes) or the whole bitumen were aged. It was thus proposed that the polar components of the bitumen covered the catalytic site on the aggregate surface when the bitumen is in contact with mineral aggregate, therefore inhibiting their effect [15,33]. Later on, the same group used a different procedure to age materials: bitumen and filler were mixed to form mastics. They were then aged in a specific test for 2-3 days at 98.9 and 113[degrees]C [20]. This way, it was confirmed that limestone filler at 20 wt% had no effect on bitumen ageing when hydrated lime was clearly reducing the overall kinetics [20]. 
		 SHRP researchers studied the PAV ageing of mastics made with 25-32 vol% limestone, gravel, sandstone and greywacke fillers. They did not observe any measurable difference in the effect between these minerals on bitumen ageing [18]. 
		 In 2007, Huang and Zeng studied the PAV ageing for 100-2000 h at 60[degrees]C for mastics made with 20 wt% limestone or granite [34]. They concluded that both minerals slowed down bitumen ageing. 
		 Meanwhile, Wu and Airey tested the TFOT ageing of mastics made with 40 vol% mineral filler made of limestone, gritstone or Portland cement [35]. They observed that the ageing index of the mastics was lower (1.5-1.9) than that of the neat bitumen (2.3) and that the mastic made of limestone was giving the lowest ageing index (1.5). Gritstone and Portland cement gave the same results. They interpreted these findings by the combination of a catalytic effect of the mineral and the adsorption of some of the lighter components of the bitumen in the mineral porosity, as observed by an increase in polar components after bitumen recovery. They proposed that the polar components remained trapped on the limestone surface with limited effect on the bulk properties, in order to explain that the higher concentration in polar components did not manifest into higher age hardening. 
		 More recently, Faxina and coworkers [36] studied the effect of RTFOT on mastics made with 15, 30 and 45 vol% of basalt filler. Focusing on the ageing index in the viscous regime (i.e., temperatures of 64 [degrees]C and higher), it appears that the ageing index started to significantly change from that of the neat bitumen for loadings of 30 and 45 vol%. 
		 Finally, a last study was published in 2015 regarding the effect of increasing amounts of silica fume (2, 4 and 8 wt%) on bitumen RTFOT ageing [37]. It was observed that all amounts of silica fume had a significant impact on the ageing index of the tested mastics, showing that nanometric amorphous silica could reduce bitumen ageing. 
		 2.3. Discussion of the existing data 
		 Clearly, the published data give a contradictory view of the effect of mineral filler on bitumen ageing. We believe that part of the problem comes from the use of high filler content, whose effect is threefold. 
		 First, the filler has a strong viscosifying effect on the bitumen [5,38]. As a consequence ageing tests impacted by viscosity could potentially be affected by the use of mastic instead of neat bitumen. This is typically the case of RTFOT and RCAT, where the ageing material forms a rotating film whose thickness depends on the viscosity. This has long been known to be a major difficulty when testing thick binders such as polymer-modified bitumens [6]. As a consequence, the mastic may age differently when compared to the neat bitumen, because the exposure to oxygen, that depends on the film thickness [39], may significantly decrease if the mastic is significantly more viscous. The practical consequence would be a reduced severity of the ageing test in the presence of filler, that would then be incorrectly interpreted as a slowing down of bitumen ageing. 
		 Second, the filler forms a geometrical barrier to oxygen diffusion. This was already recognized by SHRP researchers [18], and could also limit oxygen diffusion in ageing tests whose kinetics is governed by oxygen diffusion. The practical consequence would also be a reduced severity of the ageing test in the presence of filler, that would then be also incorrectly interpreted as a slowing down of bitumen ageing. Note that on a practical standpoint, at 70 [degrees]C, oxygen diffusion can lead to an initial decrease in oxygen concentration of order 10% for a film thickness of 50 pm but of 100% for a film thickness of 1.6 mm [39]. 
		 Finally, the presence of high filler content enhances the potential risk of bitumen absorption when the filler is porous. This absorption is time-dependent and, depending on the bitumen-filler combination, can develop in several hours at 140 [degrees]C [31]. The practical consequence would be an increase in filler volume fraction over time, creating a higher stiffening effect [5], that would then be incorrectly interpreted as an increased ageing of the bitumen based on the ageing index. 
		 These latter effect has probably been of major importance in the aforementioned study with the RCAT device [19], and would very likely explain that ageing was seen to be barely improved as quantified by the ageing index when FTIR gave a different picture, as was also seen in another study [40]. 
		 Therefore, we advocate that the filler content should be kept at a maximum 10 vol%, which represents 20 wt% for a filler density of 2.65, in order to limit its impact on viscosity, on oxygen diffusion and on the extent of adsorption. With this recommendation in mind, we see that very little published data fall in this range, probably explaining most of the confusing results. It is consistent with the results by Faxina and coworkers, when focusing on their high temperature data [36]. This content is also significantly above 10 wt%, which was seen to be sufficient to highlight the beneficial effect of hydrated lime [28]. Given that hydrated lime has a 2- to 10-times higher surface area than most mineral fillers [31], using too low a concentration of filler might not be conclusive just because of a too-small surface area, hence our choice of 20 wt%. 
		 Also, the use of testing method with no film rotation is preferred. This makes it even surer that viscosity would not be an issue. Note that the viscosity of the mastic at a concentration of 20 wt% can almost double that of the neat bitumen with some fillers such as hydrated lime or fly ash [5]. Still, this effect remains somewhat limited, given that a change in bitumen paving grade can impact the viscosity by a similar factor (or even more). So, we prefer to use the PAV method, which has the advantage to be able to reproduce both short-term and long-term ageing. It was indeed demonstrated on five neat bitumens, that 5 h of PAV ageing were similar in terms of physicochemical effects, to the standard PAV procedure [41]. Therefore, RTFOT and RTFOT + PAV ageing can be simulated by performing 5 h of PAV, followed by another 20 h of PAV. 
		 This procedure was first validated with a limited number of materials and then tested with other materials to compare various mastic compositions. 
		 3. Materials and procedures 
		 3.1. Materials 
		 In order to validate the proposed ageing method, two 50/70 bitumen were first used, one from the Nynas refinery in Antwerpen (Belgium), labelled 50/70N, and the other from the Repsol refinery of Puertollano (Spain), labelled 50/70R. In the second part of the study, a 35/50 bitumen from the Galp refinery in Porto (Portugal) was used, labelled 35/50G. Their main properties are given in Table 1. 
		 In the first part of the study, a commercial limestone filler LI from Tricalsa (Spain) was used (98 wt% CaC[O.sub.3]). Two hydrated lime specimens were supplied by Lhoist (Belgium): a standard calcic hydrated lime CL1 with 90% purity class (CL 90 S according to EN 459-1) was compared with a fine high surface area FL product with the same purity. In the second part of the study, a second limestone filler L2 from the Eurocalcio quarry (Portugal) and a granitic filler G from the Monte Adriano quarry (Trofa, Portugal) were used. A new standard CL 90 S calcic hydrated lime CL2 was supplied by Lusical (Portugal). CEM II 32.5 N Portland cement from SECIL (Portugal) and hydraulic lime (HL 5) from SECIL Martinganca (Portugal) were added for comparison purposes. Portland cement is mostly composed of tricalcium silicate, while hydraulic lime is mostly made of dicalcium silicate. The main properties of all studied fillers are given in Table 2. Particle size was measured in methanol using a Coulter LS 230 laser diffractometer. Surface area was measured by the Blaine method (EN 196-6) for all fillers except for hydrated lime, for which the high porosity makes it impossible to perform the test with the required bed porosity of 0.5. Values can still be obtained, that are generally 10 [m.sup.2]/g, but with a strong dependence on sample preparation, as observed with other porous fillers such as fly ashes [42], Therefore, no Blaine data were acquired for the calcic lime specimens. So, the surface area for all fillers was also measured by nitrogen adsorption using the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method, which is the preferred method for hydrated lime due to its high internal porosity [31]. The porous volume and main pore size were calculated using the Barrett Joyner Halenda (BJH) method [43]. An average pore size can be calculated from their ratio [43], Note that it has already been observed for fillers having little internal porosity, for which the BET surface area remains lower than say 4 [m.sup.2]/g, that Blaine and BET surface area have the same order of magnitude [42]. 
		 Mastics were prepared by adding the filler at 20 wt% (based on the mastic) in the bitumen heated to 150 [degrees]C. Once the filler was in the bitumen, agitation was set to 500 rpm for 30 min. The agitation time was limited to 30 min in order to ensure that the bitumen didn't age significantly in this procedure, yet maintaining a long-enough agitation time so that the bitumen could fully enter the filler porosity [31]. Given the limited increase in viscosity due to filler addition, mastics could be handled easily just like neat bitumen for subsequent testing. 
		 3.2. Test methods 
		 All binders and mastics were aged using the PAV apparatus already described with first a short-term procedure consisting of letting the materials for 25 h in the device, using the set-up and other parameters as described in EN 14769. As explained above, this was shown to be very similar to RTFOT + PAV ageing for neat bitumen [41]. The procedure aims at simulating long-term ageing on a material having undergone short-term ageing. It is therefore similar to the combined RTFOT and PAV method required in current US specifications (AASHTO M320). A binder having undergone this ageing procedure is supposed to be in an ageing stage representative of what would be observed for a hot mix asphalt made with the same binder after several years of exposure. 
		 The extent of ageing was simply measured by the ring and ball (R&amp;B) softening point of the tested material using EN 1427. Again, given the limited increase in viscosity due to filler addition, EN 1427 could be applied with strict compliance to the standard for all materials in terms of sample preparation and testing. Of course, more sophisticated rheological methods and spectroscopic technics such as Fourier-Transform Infra-Red could also be used. Still, given the good correlation between viscosity increase and carbonyl content [44], a rheological indicator such as softening point is already a very good indicator of the extent of age-hardening, as long as other factors, in particular filler viscosifying effect, remain secondary, which was the case in our study thanks to the use of low enough filler loadings. Therefore, in this paper, we only focused on R&amp;B as a hardening indicator, because the objective is to illustrate that the procedure is simple and valuable information can already be gathered with widely available simple standard tests. This way, the difference in softening point [DELTA]R&amp;B before and after ageing, quantifies the extent of age-hardening. In other words, this test method is intended to allow for a quick detection of fillers having a potential effect on bitumen ageing. 
		 4. Results and discussion 
		 4.2. Validation of the procedure 
		 The results obtained for the first set of mastics are given in Table 3 and Fig. 1. The mastics made with the 50/70N bitumen showed that the [DELTA]R&amp;B was similar with limestone filler (MN1 with [DELTA]R&amp;B = 14.8) than for the neat bitumen ([DELTA]R&amp;B = 14.1). In fact, the difference was not significative, taking into account that the repeatability of the R&amp;B test is 1 [degrees]C (Note that we focused on the repeatability rather than reproducibility given that the same operator performed all the tests on the same device). On the contrary, the effect of both types of hydrated lime is a clear reduction in [DELTA]R&amp;B. This confirms earlier findings that hydrated lime slows down bitumen ageing [26-31,40]. For this bitumen, and although the result is slightly lower, fine hydrated lime is not significatively different than the standard product. 
		 As regards mastics made with the 50/70R bitumen, the results are more or less aligned with the other bitumen: limestone filler has no significative impact on bitumen ageing whereas both grades of hydrated lime have a strong impact and dramatically reduce the age hardening. However, the effect of fine lime was enhanced with this bitumen and was clearly more effective in reducing age hardening than standard hydrated lime. This effect might be more pronounced with 50/70R because this second bitumen experiences a stronger ageing susceptibility, as materialized by a higher [DELTA]R&amp;B for the neat bitumen (20.1 [degrees]C vs 14.1 [degrees]C). 
		 Interestingly, bitumen acid number (Table 1) wasn't a good indicator of the effectiveness of the lime treatment, since the ageing of the more acid bitumen (50/70N) was less reduced by lime addition. Also counterintuitive, this isn't so surprising, if three elements are taken into account. 
		 First, the effect of lime seem also to be magnified with bitumen 50/70R simply because it is more susceptible to ageing. The differences before and after ageing are therefore higher in absolute terms, making variations more perceptible. 
		 Second, the acid number quantificates all acid groups in the bitumen, regardless of their ability to concentrate on the lime particles surface. In reality, only part of the acid functional groups of the bitumen are able to react with the lime, in a proportion that depends on the overall chemical structure of the bitumen and hence on crude origin [45]. A better indicator would certainly be the basic extract on chromatographic columns, which is however a lot more complex to quantificate [5]. 
		 Finally, lime effectiveness is here only measured by the increase in R&amp;B which can be linked to viscosity [5]. In parallel, it is well known that the viscosity of bitumen is linked to its asphaltenes content in a non-linear way [46). More precisely, a large increase in viscosity might be due to small variations in asphaltenes content for high initial values, when on the contrary, a smaller viscosity increase could be induced by a larger increase in asphaltenes content for low initial values. Therefore, viscosity is not a direct indicator of asphaltenes content. However, obtaining the full viscosity--asphaltenes curve for a given bitumen origin is very tedious [5,46]. 
		 Obviously, a more fundamental study would be needed, with a full bitumen characterization on both chemical and rheological terms, in order to better understand the factors explaining the extent of bitumen-lime interactions. 
		 The data also showed that the stiffening effect of hydrated lime was clearly manifested: the initial R&amp;B value for the mastics made with both grades of hydrated limes were higher than those made with the limestone filler (Table 3). This was expected given the higher dry compacted porosity (also known as Rigden air voids) of these materials compared to limestone filler (Table 2), and the good correlation between both parameters [31], Still, the stiffening effect remained limited to less than 6.1 [degrees]C at most, and was indeed not significative for the limestone filler. This confirmed that the choice of filler concentration was appropriate in order to limit the viscosity increase due to filler addition. In all cases, it must be remembered that the stiffening effect of hydrated lime is stronger at high temperature than below room temperature, a fact that remains to be fully understood [31], So, the increase in R&amp;B can't be directly interpreted in terms of embrittlement and specific low temperature testing would be needed to conclude on this point. 
		 In addition, the final R&amp;B value for all mastics after long-term ageing tends to level off. In other words, the difference in R&amp;B between the neat bitumen and the mastics made with lime, decreased after ageing (Table 3): 
		 --For bitumen 50/70N, it went from 6.1 [degrees]C (before) to 4.9 [degrees]C (after ageing) for calcic lime (CL1) and from 4.9 [degrees]C (before) to 3.2 [degrees]C (after ageing) for fine lime (FL), 
		 --For bitumen 50/70R, it went from 4.4 [degrees]C (before) to 0.8 [degrees]C (after ageing) for calcic lime (CL1) and from 4.5 [degrees]C (before) to -3.1 [degrees]C (after ageing) for fine lime (FL). 
		 Clearly, the reduction of age-hardening due to hydrated lime addition tends to overcome the initial stiffening effect. 
		 Finally, this first part of the study clearly showed that the proposed testing protocol was relevant and highlighted: 
		 --the known behaviour of hydrated lime in terms of reducing age-hardening. Fine lime was seen to be more efficient than standard lime, especially for the bitumen more prone to age-hardening (50/70R), 
		 --the known behaviour of hydrated lime in terms of mastic stiffening, 
		 --the fact that limestone filler had no significative impact on bitumen ageing, confirming earlier findings [15, 18, 34]. 
		 This last fact was however in contradiction with other works [34, 35], The difference with the Wu study [35] can easily be explained by the artefacts described in Section 2.3. Still, the Huang study [34] can't be linked to any of the factors listed in Section 2.3. In fact, they also used a PAV protocol and the filler content was identical to the one used in this work. Therefore, some other factor must come in play, and the main difference (apart from other choices of bitumen and filler) is that their study was performed over longer periods of time at a lower temperature: 100 to 2000 h at 60 [degrees]C. For comparison purposes, and based on carbonyl formation kinetics, bitumen oxidation at 60 [degrees]C proceeds ~ 10 times slower than at 100 [degrees]C (and ~ 500 times slower than at 165 [degrees]C [47]). Therefore, 100-2000 h at 60 [degrees]C would be equivalent to 10-200 h at 100 [degrees]C. In other words, the kinetics in the Huang study extended much longer than the here-in studied interval. So, it might well be that over a longer range, limestone filler would have an effect on bitumen oxidation. However, longer oxidation times would then lose representativity towards normal pavement behaviour. In this context, the conclusion of this study would be that under the usual ageing conditions seen on an asphaltic pavement, limestone filler is not expected to chemically slow down bitumen ageing. 
		 4.2. Comparison of various fillers 
		 The results obtained for the second set of mastics in given in Table 4 and Fig. 2. The new mastic made with another limestone filler did not show a significant difference in terms of ageing as compared to the neat bitumen. This therefore confirmed the findings of the first part of the study. 
		 In addition, the granitic filler didn't generate either a significative change in age-hardening (AR&amp;B of 11.2 [degrees]C vs 11.8 for the neat bitumen). 
		 Again, the effect of hydrated lime on age-hardening was confirmed. Also, the same observations as before could be made regarding the stiffening effect. 
		 Interestingly, both Portland cement and hydraulic lime had a significant impact in terms of reducing bitumen age-hardening. Still, the effect was less pronounced than with hydrated lime (AR&amp;B of 9.8 [degrees]C and 9.4 [degrees]C respectively, vs 8.2 [degrees]C for hydrated lime). This suggests that the basicity of these materials was strong enough to generate a similar effect as hydrated lime (see Section 2.1). However, the extent of the interactions was not as pronounced, probably because of a lower surface area (Table 2). 
		 In addition, the data on the initial R&amp;B value also shows that Portland cement and hydraulic lime generated the same initial stiffening effect as the other mineral fillers. This could also be anticipated from their similar dry porosity value (Table 2), using known correlations [31]. 
		 5. Conclusion 
		 After reviewing published data on the topic, this article proposed a simple method in order to evaluate the impact of any mineral filler on bitumen ageing. The method was based on using low yet significant amounts of filler, and a concentration of 20wt% was recommended. The preferred ageing test was the PAV performed after 25 h in order to replicate the well-known RTFOT + PAV combination with an easier experimental set-up [41]. 
		 Any rheological or physico-chemical property could then be measured before and after ageing. For the sake of simplicity, the variation in R&amp;B softening point was used to illustrate the impact of the different fillers. 
		 The method was first tested on two bitumens, and it was shown that two grades of hydrated lime could significantly reduce the ageing of both bitumens, while limestone filler had no effect. The use of fine high-surface area lime was observed to enhance the age-reducing effect. 
		 Then, the method was used to compare different fillers with yet another bitumen source. Limestone and granite mineral fillers from crushed aggregates were seen to have no effect on bitumen ageing. A new sample of hydrated lime confirmed the ability to reduce bitumen ageing by lime addition. Interestingly, both Portland cement and hydraulic lime were also seen to reduce bitumen age-hardening, but to a lesser extent that hydrated lime. 
		 More research is needed in order to explain these findings. In particular, it is widely accepted that the anti-ageing effect of hydrated lime originates from the acid-base interactions between the bitumen and lime [31]. The same mechanisms are probably at play with Portland cement and hydraulic lime, and a lower surface area could probably justify a lower efficiency. 
		 In all cases, mineral fillers from crushed aggregate such as limestone and granite, were confirmed not to impact bitumen ageing with the proposed method. Given that the testing protocol limits the main artefacts observed in previous studies [34, 35], this result therefore confirms earlier findings [18, 20, 33] while explaining other controversial conclusions.

<titre>FACTBOX-The hunt for the Paris attackers</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Nov 26 (Reuters) - France and Belgium are hunting suspects and would-be attackers following the shootings and bombings in Paris on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and injured hundreds. 
		 Eight attackers are dead though the total number of assailants may have been 10 or higher. Investigations are centred on Salah Abdeslam who police think might be an assailant referred to in statement in which militant group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.
		Here is what we know about the suspects and the wider circle pursued by police as attention focuses on the Belgian warning that there is a "serious and imminent" danger in Brussels. 
		 KEY EVENTS: Nov 13: France. Seven assailants dead: three at the Bataclan concert hall, three outside the Stade de France stadium and one of three gunmen involved in the cafe killings. Nov 18: France. Three people died and eight were arrested in a police assault on a hideout flat in St. Denis. One of the three is identified as suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who also played a direct role in the cafe shootings, prosecutor Francois Molins said. Nov 21 onwards: Belgium reports serious and imminent danger of Paris-style attacks, deploying soldiers on the streets of Brussels and conducting police searches for would-be attackers and suspects with links to the Paris attacks. 
		 UNACCOUNTED FOR: 
		 Salah Abdeslam, 26, French, born in Brussels (Sept. 15, 1989). Suspected of having rented the VW Polo and Renault Clio cars used in the attacks. Investigators say he went to Belgium from France the day after the attacks in a VW Golf, despite being stopped by French police along the way in routine road checks, before his name was circulated as a suspect. 
		 His brother, Brahim, died in the attack (below). A third brother, cleared of any involvement after briefly being detained, said Salah may have had a change of heart in Paris. 
		 However, fears that Salah is back in Belgium and/or plotting attacks prompted closure of Brussels underground rail lines, schools, shopping centres and other public places on Nov. 20 - a protective shutdown that was partially lifted as of Nov. 25. 
		 French police are examining a suicide belt dumped in Montrouge on the southwestern fringes of Paris, where phone traces suggested Salah was present on the night of Nov. 13. 
		 Investigators are trying to establish whether Salah Abdeslam had been meant to carry out an attack in Paris's 18th district but for some reason did not, prosecutor Molins said. 
		 In its statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack in the 18th district that did not happen. 
		 Mohamed Abrini, 30, Belgian of Moroccan origin, seen by police on video footage with Salah at a car fuelling station in Ressons, a town north of Paris near the motorway linking Belgium to the French capital, on Nov. 11, two days before the attacks. The Renault Clio the two were seen in was one of the cars used in the attacks. A Belgian police notice describes Abrini, who fought in Syria and came from the same Brussels area as the Abdeslam brothers and Abdelhamid Abaaoud, as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 DEAD ATTACKERS: 
		 Bataclan: (3 dead gunmen with suicide vests, two named) Ismail Omar Mostefai, 29 (born Nov. 21, 1985), Frenchman of Algerian descent involved in the Bataclan attack, lived for a time in Chartres area, southwest of Paris. Born in Courcouronnes, south of Paris. Source: prosecutor's office/judiciary sources. His name was put on French intelligence services' "S notice" in 2010 for reported radicalisation. An unnamed senior Turkish government official says Turkey contacted France about Mostefai in December 2014 and June 2015 but only got a return request for information on him after the Paris attacks.. 
		 Samy Amimour, 28 (born Oct. 15, 1987), involved in the Bataclan attack. French, from Drancy near St. Denis. Subject of international arrest warrant since late 2013. Had been under official investigation since October 2012 on suspicion of terrorism-related activity over a plan to go to Yemen. Source: Paris prosecutor's office statement. Amimour, a bus driver who had been radicalised in a mosque near Drancy, was ordered by police to check in with them every week but missed four checks in 2013. It was only after nearly a month that the authorities put out an international arrest warrant for him but he was already in Syria. Other: A third attacker in the Bataclan attack was shot dead by police. No further identity information has been provided. 
		 Cafe killings: (3 gunmen, 2 identified) Brahim Abdeslam, 31 (born July 30, 1984), French citizen but born and raised in Brussels, where he ran a bar in the Molenbeek district with brother Salah. Blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in wake of the shootings. His fingerprints were on one of the AK47 rifles left in a Seat Leon used in the attacks. 
		 Presumed ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, grew up in the Molenbeek district of Brussels, but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria where he was one of Islamic States most high-profile European recruits. Local media say he was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time in prison alongside Salah Abdeslam. Before the attacks, European governments believed Abaaoud was still in Syria, having been in Belgium in January plotting attacks that were foiled when police raided a house in Verviers, killing two Belgian associates. 
		 Prosecutor Molins confirmed on Nov. 24 that Abaaoud both took part in the cafe shootings and returned to the killing scenes while the Bataclan attack was still underway on the night of Nov. 13. He also said Abaaoud and another man were believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack on <mention id="2034">the La Defense business district</mention> in the west of Paris on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 Closed circuit TV footage showed Abaaoud entering the Croix de Chavaux metro railway station in eastern Paris with another man on Nov. 13, a couple of hundred metres from where the Seat Leon used in the cafe shootings was found. His fingerprints were found on one of three AK47 assault rifles left in the car. Other: a third gunman who took part in the cafe shootings has not been identified. Investigators say the DNA of a person who blew himself up during a police raid on Nov. 18 in St. Denis matches traces found on one of the AK47 rifles in the abandoned Seat and that may mean he is the third person who took part in the cafe shootings. Stade de France: (3 dead suicide bombers who used vests containing bolts, 1 named) Bilal Hadfi, 20 (born Jan 22, 1995). Blew himself up in the Nov. 13 attack on Stade de France stadium. He dropped out of school in Brussels in February 2014 to travel to Syria. Believing he was back, police bugged his apartment but he did not show up. Other: A man blew himself up outside Gate D at the Stade de France. A passport found near his dead body has the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, 25, (born Sept. 10, 1990), from Idlib, northwest Syria. His fingerprints match up with prints of a person registered under that name as arriving in Greece in Oct. 3, 2015. Source: French prosecutor's office. It has not been confirmed that the bomber is the man in the passport. Other: The fingerprints of a third man who blew himself up outside Gate H of the Stade de France show that he passed through Greece at the same time as the other unidentified stadium suicide bomber, prosecutors say. Police have published a photo in an appeal for help to identify the man. 
		 OTHER DEAD: 
		 Hasna Aitboulahcen: woman, 26, who suffocated under rubble in the Nov. 18 police assault in St. Denis, said prosecutor Francois Molins. Police were tapping her phone as part of a drugs probe and watched her lead Abaaoud back to the apartment before the raid. Abaaoud and another man apparently called her in haste on Nov. 17 from where they were hiding in bushes to find them a hideout. 
		 Other: The third person who died in Nov. 18 St. Denis assault may have been the third gunmen involved in the cafe shootings but this has yet to be confirmed. 
		 DETAINED: 
		 In France: Jawad Bendaoud, one of eight arrested in St. Denis swoop, who provided lodgings for Abaaoud. Jawad told French TV as he was being led away to custody on Nov. 18 that he was unaware he had helped suspected terrorists. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said Bendaoud was in contact before and after the attacks with a person using a Belgian phone who was in turn in phone contact with the attackers. 
		 The other seven arrested, five of whom are thought to be illegal squatters who had taken refuge in the same building, according to police sources, were released after questioning. 
		 In a sweep facilitated by state of emergency rules, police said since Nov. 13 they had conducted 1,233 searches of homes of people suspected of Islamist links (not directly related to attacks), taking 124 into custody. They had confiscated 230 weapons, according to the Interior Ministry as of Nov. 24. 
		 In Turkey: Ahmet Dahmani, a Belgian man of Moroccan origin suspected of some form of involvement in the Paris attack was arrested by police in Turkey on Nov. 21, a government official said. A Turkish news agency said he acted as a 'scout' in selecting target locations. Dahmani, 26, was arrested at a luxury hotel in the southern Turkish coastal city of Antalya after travelling from Amsterdam on Nov. 14. Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, the official said. 
		 In Belgium: Five have been detained on suspicion of terrorist-related so far after dozens of arrests. 
		 Mohammad Amri, 27, and Hamza Attouh, 21, went to Paris by car shortly after the attacks to fetch Salah Abdeslam and bring him back to Belgium on Nov. 14. 
		 Lazez Abraimi, 39, Moroccan living in western Brussels. His lawyers say he admits taking Salah somewhere in Brussels in his car but knows nothing else. Abraimi's brother is in Syria but he himself is not a radical. He deals in bric-a-brac, hence the two handguns in his car, one of which was a signal pistol. The blood in his car is not that of Salah, his lawyer says. 
		 Ali O., 31, a Frenchman living in Molenbeek, Brussels, is accused of driving Salah in Brussels on Nov. 14. 
		 Fifth person, no information so far. 
		 Regarding Amri and Attouh, lawyer Xavier Carette said his client Amri was an unwitting accomplice who knew nothing about any role in attacks when he drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels on night of Nov. 13-14. A lawyer for Attouh quoted him as saying that Abdeslam was "extremely tense" and may have still been wearing a suicide belt under his down jacket. 
		 Mohammad Abdeslam, brother of Salah and dead Brahim, was among five released after arrests on Nov. 19. (Compiled by Brian Love with reporters in Paris and Brussels; editing by David Clarke)

<titre>French gas giant GDF Suez changes name to Engie</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		PARIS, April 24 (Reuters) - French gas utility GDF Suez said on Friday it was changing its name to "Engie" to reflect an evolving energy sector and the group's growing involvement in renewable power, marking a break from its former state monopoly past. 
		 The change comes as Chief Executive Gerard Mestrallet prepares to pass the baton of the power and gas utility to his anointed successor and current deputy Isabelle Kocher after the 66-year old's mandate expires in 2016.
		"Why this name change? Because the world of energy is changing, we're moving towards a less centralised, less carbon-intensive energy world, away from the centralised world of yesterday," Mestrallet said at a press conference at <meronyme id="2035">the group's skyscraper</meronyme> in <mention id="2036">the La Defense financial district</mention> of Paris. 
		 Mestrallet also said "Engie", pronounced like the 1973 Rolling Stones ballad "Angie", was meant to accompany the organisation change along geographical lines rather than business sectors announced earlier this month. 
		 Asked if dropping GDF, which stands for Gaz de France, meant the former state monopoly was breaking away from France, Mestrallet said: "A break with a new name doesn't mean we're casting off all moorings." 
		 The new name marks the end of the Gaz de France initials known by French people since the utility was created in 1946 with sister company Electricité de France by a Communist minister during France's post-war reconstruction effort. 
		 "GDF brought back memories of nationalisations. They're clearly turning the page, the notion of public service is over," said Marcel Botton, president of branding company Nomen. 
		 "Gas has become a product like any other, they acknowledge that with the name change," he told Reuters. 
		 The change also drops the Suez name, inherited from the 2008 merger of GDF with Suez SA -- the company that built the Suez Canal in the 19th century -- leaving it to water utility Suez Environnement, spun off after the GDF Suez merger. 
		 The French government still owns a third of GDF Suez. It is set to acquire double voting rights at the group's shareholder meeting on April 28, which would clear the way for the treasury to sell part of its stake while maintaining influence. 
		 GDF Suez, which took a record 15 billion euro writedown in 2013 as the economic crisis and vast overcapacities hit the value of traditional gas-fired power plants, has said it wants to double its renewable power capacity in Europe by 2025.

<titre>WRAPUP 11-At least two die in police raid on group planning new Paris attack</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Adds details of raid, Jewish teacher stabbed in Marseille) 
		 * At least two die, eight arrested in pre-dawn raid 
		 * Group was planning to attack <mention id="2037">business district</mention> -sources 
		 * Raid aimed at alleged Nov. 13 attack mastermind
		* Unclear if Belgian militant amongst those killed 
		 By Emmanuel Jarry and Antony Paone 
		 SAINT DENIS, France, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A woman suicide bomber blew herself up in a police raid on Wednesday that sources said had foiled a jihadi plan to hit <mention id="2038">Paris's business district</mention>, days after a wave of attacks killed 129 across the French capital. 
		 Police stormed an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis before dawn in a hunt for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian militant accused of masterminding the bombings and shootings, but by evening it was still unclear if he had died in the assault. 
		 Heavily armed officers triggered a massive firefight and multiple explosions when they entered the building. Eight people were arrested and forensic scientists were working to confirm if two or three militants had died in the violence. 
		 "A new team of terrorists has been neutralised," Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters on Wednesday evening, saying police had fired 5,000 rounds of munitions into the apartment, which was left shredded by the raid, its windows blown out and the facade riddled with bullet impacts. 
		 "This commando could have become operational," Molins said. 
		 A source close to the investigation said the dead woman might have been Abaaoud's cousin, while the Washington Post quoted senior intelligence officials as saying Abaaoud himself had died in the shoot out. 
		 Molins said none of the bodies had been identified, adding only that Abaaoud was not amongst those detained. 
		 Police were led to the apartment following a tip-off that the 28-year-old Belgian, previously thought to have orchestrated the Nov. 13 attacks from Syria, was actually in France. 
		 Investigators believe the attacks -- the worst atrocity in France since World War Two -- were set in motion in Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St. Denis just after 4.15 a.m. (0315 GMT). 
		 "We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake," Sabrine, a downstairs neighbour from the apartment that was raided, told Europe 1 radio. 
		 Molins said an initial attempt to blow in the front door in had failed because it was metal-plated, giving those inside time to pick up their guns and fight back. The confrontation was so violent part of the apartment was in danger of collapsing. 
		 Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion. 
		 "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up...," he told Reuters, without giving details. Five police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was also killed. 
		 FLEEING RAQQA 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 On Wednesday evening, prosecutors in the southern French city of Marseille said a Jewish teacher had been stabbed there by three people claiming to be supporters of Islamic State. The teacher's life was not in danger. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the radicals and has launched three air strikes on Raqqa -- the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria -- since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Wednesday the bombardments have killed at least 33 Islamic State militants over the past three days. 
		 Citing activists, the Observatory said Islamic State members and dozens of families of senior members had started fleeing Raqqa to relocate to Mosul in neighbouring Iraq. 
		 French prosecutors have identified five of the seven dead assailants from Friday -- four Frenchmen and a man who was fingerprinted in Greece last month after arriving in the country via Turkey with a boatload of refugees fleeing the Syria war. 
		 Police believe two men directly involved in the assault subsequently escaped, including Salah Abdeslam, 26, a Belgian-based Frenchman who is accused of having played a central role in both planning and executing the deadly mission. 
		 French authorities said on Wednesday they had identified all the Nov. 13 victims. They came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. 
		 Empowered by a state of emergency introduced in France last Friday, police here have made hundreds of raids across the country over the past three days, arresting 60 suspects, putting 118 under house arrest and seizing 75 weapons. 
		 Until Wednesday morning, officials had said Abaaoud was in Syria. He grew up in Brussels, but media said he moved to Syria in 2014 to fight with Islamic State. Since then he has travelled back to Europe at least once and was involved in a series of planned attacks in Belgium foiled by the police last January. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters that the St. Denis cell was planning a fresh attack. "This new team was planning an attack on <mention id="2039">La Defense</mention>," one source said, referring to a high-rise neighbourhood on the outskirts of Paris that is home to top banks and businesses. 
		 A man in St. Denis told reporters that he had rented out the besieged apartment to two people last week. 
		 "Someone asked me a favour, I did them a favour. Someone asked me to put two people up for three days and I did them a favour, it's normal. I don't know where they came from I don't know anything," the man told Reuters Television. 
		 He was later arrested by police. 
		 AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
		 Global anxiety was reflected in a flurry of new security alerts on Wednesday. 
		 Sweden raised its threat level by one step to four on a scale of five, the high-speed Eurostar train that connects Paris and London briefly suspended check-in at Paris's Gare du Nord and several German Bundesliga soccer teams said they were beefing up security ahead of their matches. 
		 The Russian air force on Wednesday carried out a "mass strike" on Islamic State positions around Syria, including Raqqa, Russian news agencies reported. 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Hollande will meet U.S. President Barack Obama, who says Russia must shift its focus from "propping up" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, two days before that in Washington. 
		 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Western nations had to drop their demands for Assad's exit if they wanted to build a coalition against Islamic State. 
		 Russia is allied to Assad but the West says he must go if there is to be a political solution to Syria's prolonged civil war. Hollande said countries should set aside their sometimes diverging national interests to battle their common foe. 
		 "The international community must rally around that spirit. I know very well that each country doesn't have the same interests," he told an assembly of city mayors on Wednesday. 
		 A French aircraft carrier group was headed to the eastern Mediterranean to intensify the number of strikes in Syria. Russia has said its navy will cooperate with this mission.

<titre>Impact of strike at Total's French refineries remains limited</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		PARIS, July 2 (Reuters) - A strike at Total's French refineries, oil depots and service stations called by the hardline CGT union had failed to muster much support by Thursday morning, company and union officials said. 
		 "Nothing to report in refineries, depots and stations this morning at 10 am (0800 GMT)," a Total spokesman said, adding that the La Mede plant near Marseille remained shut following a strike by local workers which started last month.
		The move by France's biggest union was an attempt to extend protests by La Mede workers against Total's plans to end crude oil processing at the site on the Mediterranean, prompted by vast overcapacity in Europe as oil demand declines. 
		 The company plans to cut 180 out of 430 jobs at the 153,000 barrels-per-day plant, as well as investing 200 million euros ($225 million) there to create France's first biorefinery. 
		 An official from the moderate CFDT union, which has not called for a strike, said the CGT had failed to mobilise in refineries but planned to block <meronyme id="2040">a Total service station</meronyme> at <mention id="2041">the La Defense business district of Paris</mention> this morning. 
		 No CGT union official was immediately available to comment. The union has argued that shutting crude oil refining at La Mede would worsen France's reliance on fuel imports, including from Total's new Jubail plant in Saudi Arabia. (Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by David Holmes)

<titre>CORRECTED-WRAPUP 1-France confirms suspected mastermind of Paris attacks killed in raid</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Corrects translation of quote in paragraph 3. Prosecutors said the body was "riddled with impacts" rather than "riddled with bullets") 
		 By John Irish and Gregory Blachier 
		 PARIS, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The suspected mastermind of last week's Paris attacks was killed in the police raid of an apartment north of the capital, French officials said on Thursday.
		Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian militant who had boasted of mounting attacks in Europe for the Islamic State, was accused of orchestrating last Friday's coordinated bombings and shootings in the French capital, which killed 129 people. 
		 "It was his body we discovered in the building, riddled with impacts," a statement from the Paris prosecutor said, a day after the pre-dawn raid. The prosecutor later added that it was unclear whether Abaaoud had detonated a suicide belt. 
		 Prime Minister Manuel Valls broke the news in Parliament to applause from lawmakers who were voting on Thursday to extend the country's state of emergency for another three months. 
		 "We know today ... that the mastermind of the attacks - or one of them, let's remain cautious - was among those dead," Valls told reporters. Confirmation that Abaaoud was in Paris will focus more attention on European security services, who ahead of Friday's attacks had thought he was still in Syria. 
		 "This is a major failing," said Roland Jaquard at the International Observatory for Terrorism. 
		 Early on Wednesday morning, investigations led police to the house where Abaaoud was holed up in the Paris suburb of St. Denis. Heavily armed officers stormed the building before dawn, triggering a massive firefight and multiple explosions. 
		 Officials had said on Wednesday that two people were killed in the raid, including a female suicide bomber who blew herself up. Forensic scientists were trying to determine whether a third person had died. Eight people were arrested. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters the St. Denis cell had been planning a fresh attack on <mention id="2042">Paris's La Defense business district</mention>. A source close to the investigation said the female bomber who was killed might have been Abaaoud's cousin. 
		 Investigators believe the attacks - the deadliest in France since World War Two - were set in motion in Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 The victims came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium near where Wednesday's police raid took place. 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility, saying the attacks were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the extremists and has launched air strikes on Raqqa, the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria, since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The Russian air force on Wednesday carried out a "mass strike" on Islamic State positions around Syria, including Raqqa, Russian news agencies reported. 
		 INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Two days before that, Hollande will meet in Washington with U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss the role of a U.S.-led coalition in any unified effort against Islamic State. 
		 France is one of several European countries participating in the U.S.-led coalition's strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq, and two months ago became the only European country to join strikes in Syria as well. 
		 Obama on Thursday reiterated the U.S. position that eradicating the group was tied up with ending the civil war in Syria, which could not happen as long as President Bashar al-Assad was in power. 
		 "Bottom line is, I do not foresee a situation in which we can end the civil war in Syria while Assad remains in power," he told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.

<titre>UPDATE 1-Paris attack ringleader returned to scene of crime - prosecutor</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Adds quotes, details) 
		 PARIS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The ringleader of the Paris attacks returned to the scene of the shootings and was near the Bataclan concert hall while police were still trying to oust the gunmen who killed 89 people there, the Paris prosecutor said on Tuesday. 
		 Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who died last Wednesday when police raided a flat in St. Denis north of Paris, was captured on CCTV going into a metro station near where a car with three assault rifles inside had been abandoned.
		Prosecutor Francois Molins said Abaaoud emerged from the underground at Nation station on the night of the attacks, Nov. 13. The phone Abaaoud was believed to be using was detected in the 10th, 11th and 12th districts of Paris, including near the Bataclan hall, between 22.28 (2128 GMT) and 00.28, he told a news conference. 
		 Eleven days after the attacks that killed 130 people, investigators are still piecing together who did what and when. 
		 Molins said they had still to identify a man shot dead by police in the concert hall, the two suicide bombers at the national stadium who had passed through Greece in October and the third person to die when police raided the St. Denis flat. 
		 He said the DNA of the person in the apartment, who investigators believe blew himself up, was found on one of the AK47 assault rifles in the abandoned car. The fingerprints of Abaaoud and dead attacker Brahim Abdeslam were on the other two. 
		 This meant it was possible that the third man in the flat had also taken part in the shootings but this had not been confirmed, the prosecutor said. 
		 Investigators had found a 9 mm pistol, fragments of grenades and two suicide vests in the St. Denis apartment. 
		 Molins also said Abaaoud had been planning to attack <mention id="2043">the capital's La Defense business district</mention>, as first reported by Reuters on Nov. 18. 
		 The suicide vest found on Monday south of Paris was still being analysed but it was of the same type as those used by the other suicide bombers during the attacks, Molins added. (Writing by David Clarke; editing by David Stamp)

		* Belgium hunts for "dangerous" new suspect in attacks 
		 * Ringleader "returned to scenes of crime" - prosecutor 
		 * Hollande, Obama agree to step up strikes in Syria 
		 * Brussels still under lockdown as manhunt continues (Recasts with French, Belgian prosecutors, adds Hollande, Obama)
		By Michel Rose and Philip Blenkinsop 
		 PARIS/BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - An investigation into the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris widened on Tuesday when French prosecutors said a man who provided lodging to the suspected ringleader must have known of a terrorist plot, and Belgium issued a warrant for a new suspect 
		 Painting a chilling picture of ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Paris prosecutor said that after dropping off the gunmen and suicide bombers at the cafes and bars where the attacks were to take place he had later returned to the scene while the killing spree was in full swing. 
		 The coordinated attacks, in which 130 people were killed, prompted France to declare a national state of emergency and to step up air strikes in Syria on Islamic State, the militant group which has claimed responsibility. 
		 President Francois Hollande, who is trying to rally global support for the military campaign against Islamic State, won the support of U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday during a whistlestop visit to Washington. 
		 In Paris, prosecutor Francois Molins said Islamist militants who died during a shootout with police on Nov. 18 had been plotting an attack on <mention id="2044">the capital's business district</mention>. Reuters exclusively reported the plot to attack <mention id="2045">the district of La Defense</mention> on Nov. 18. 
		 Molins said he had put under formal investigation a Frenchman who had provided lodging for Abaaoud and his associates at the apartment in the suburb of St. Denis targeted in the shootout. 
		 "Jawad Bendaoud himself welcomed the terrorists on Nov. 17 towards 22.45 pm. He could not have been in any doubt ... that he was taking part in a terrorist organisation," Molins told a news conference. 
		 Bendaoud said before he was detained by police last Wednesday that he had been asked to put up two people for three days in the apartment, but that he had no idea one of them may have been the suspected mastermind of the Nov. 13 attacks. 
		 Abaaoud died during the police raid along with Hasna Aitboulahcen, a woman believed to be his cousin, and an as yet unidentified third person. 
		 BRUSSELS LOCKDOWN 
		 French investigators are still piecing together exactly who did what when and have launched a hunt to find Salah Abdeslam, who is suspected of being the eighth attacker mentioned by Islamic State when it claimed responsibility. 
		 Abdeslam, 26, fled to Belgium the day after the shootings and his presumed presence in Brussels was one of the factors behind a security lockdown in the city over the past few days. 
		 Fearing an imminent Paris-style attack, Belgium has extended a maximum security alert in Brussels until next Monday. About half the stations on its metro system will re-open on Wednesday along with city schools, but 300 more police officers and 200 soldiers will be deployed. 
		 Belgium has been at the heart of investigations into the attacks since France said two of the suicide bombers in Paris had lived there. Five people, including two who travelled with Abdeslam back to Brussels, have been charged with terrorist offences in Belgium. Abdeslam's brother Brahim blew himself. 
		 Belgium's state prosecutor, in a statement announcing details of other people charged in the case, said on Tuesday it had issued an international arrest warrant for Mohamed Abrini, who was seen with Abdeslam two days before the attacks. 
		 Abrini, 30, was filmed with Abdeslam at a fuel station in northern France on Nov. 11 and was driving the Renault Clio car that was later used by the attackers in the French capital. 
		 An accompanying police wanted poster described Abrini as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 While major shopping centres in Brussels remained closed on Tuesday, two Ikea furniture stores on the edge of town reopened, along with some of the larger supermarkets in the city. 
		 The Magritte museum remained shut, however, and Brussels had yet to decide whether to open its Christmas market on Friday in the historic Grand Place, where workers have set up stalls with an armoured personnel carrier in the background. 
		 "We are at the time of year when we are supposed to have a lot of people, and increase business," said Brussels toy shop worker Laeticia Shalaj. "People are scared and are afraid of leaving their homes." 
		 Since the Paris killings, France has moved its flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier into the eastern Mediterranean to step up its bombardments of Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. 
		 After talks with Hollande at the White House, Obama said: "We are here today to declare that the United States and France stand united in total solidarity to deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them and to defend our nations." 
		 As millions of Americans prepare to travel for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, the State Department issued a global alert of "increased terrorist threats". 
		 Hollande is due to visit Moscow on Thursday, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss ways of boosting their campaign to crush Islamic State. 
		 EXPLOSIVE BELT? 
		 Tracing Abdeslam's movements since the attacks has been a main focus of the investigations in Paris. An explosive belt was found dumped near the capital on Monday, close to a location where his mobile phone was detected the night after the attacks, the prosecutor said. 
		 Molins said the belt was similar to those used by the bombers during the Nov. 13 attacks though it was still being established on Tuesday whether the belt was Abdeslam's. 
		 One theory was that Abdeslam had intended to blow himself up in the 18th district of Paris but had abandoned the plan, although it was not clear why. 
		 In a sweep facilitated by the state of emergency, police have conducted 1,233 searches of homes since Nov. 13, taking 124 people into custody and confiscating 230 weapons, of which half were rifle-size or army-grade, according to the Interior Ministry. 
		 Police backed up by helicopters descended on a southwestern French village on Tuesday where Salafist preacher Olivier Corel, nicknamed the "White Emir" and suspected of mentoring young jihadists, lives, a source close to the case said.

<titre>WRAPUP 12-At least two die in police raid on group planning new Paris attack</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		* At least two die, eight arrested in pre-dawn raid 
		 * Group was planning to attack <mention id="2046">business district</mention> -sources 
		 * Raid aimed at alleged Nov. 13 attack mastermind 
		 * Unclear if Belgian militant amongst those killed
		By Emmanuel Jarry and Antony Paone 
		 SAINT DENIS, France, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A woman suicide bomber blew herself up in a police raid on Wednesday that sources said had foiled a jihadi plan to hit <mention id="2047">Paris's business district</mention>, days after a wave of attacks killed 129 across the French capital. 
		 Police stormed an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis before dawn in a hunt for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian militant accused of masterminding the bombings and shootings, but by evening it was still unclear if he had died in the assault. 
		 Heavily armed officers triggered a massive firefight and multiple explosions when they entered the building. Eight people were arrested and forensic scientists were working to confirm if two or three militants had died in the violence. 
		 "A new team of terrorists has been neutralised," Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters on Wednesday evening, saying police had fired 5,000 rounds of munitions into the apartment, which was left shredded by the raid, its windows blown out and the facade riddled with bullet impacts. 
		 "This commando could have become operational," Molins said. 
		 A source close to the investigation said the dead woman might have been Abaaoud's cousin, while the Washington Post quoted senior intelligence officials as saying Abaaoud himself had died in the shoot out. 
		 Molins said none of the bodies had been identified, adding only that Abaaoud was not amongst those detained. 
		 In a sign too that Islamic State supporters were active elsewhere in France, a Jewish teacher was stabbed in the southern French port of Marseilles by three people professing solidarity with the militant group, prosecutors said. 
		 One of the three wore an Islamic State t-shirt while another attacker showed a picture on his mobile telephone of Mohamed Merah, a homegrown Islamist militant who killed seven people in attacks in southern France in 2012. The Marseilles teacher's life was not in danger. 
		 Police were led to the apartment in St. Denis following a tip-off that the 28-year-old Abaaoud, previously thought to have orchestrated the Nov. 13 attacks from Syria, was actually in France. 
		 Investigators believe the attacks -- the worst atrocity in France since World War Two -- were set in motion in Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St. Denis just after 4.15 a.m. (0315 GMT). 
		 "We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake," Sabrine, a downstairs neighbour from the apartment that was raided, told Europe 1 radio. 
		 Molins said an initial attempt to blow in the front door in had failed because it was metal-plated, giving those inside time to pick up their guns and fight back. The confrontation was so violent part of the apartment was in danger of collapsing. 
		 Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion. 
		 "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up...," he told Reuters, without giving details. Five police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was also killed. 
		 FLEEING RAQQA 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the radicals and has launched three air strikes on Raqqa -- the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria -- since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Wednesday the bombardments have killed at least 33 Islamic State militants over the past three days. 
		 Citing activists, the Observatory said Islamic State members and dozens of families of senior members had started fleeing Raqqa to relocate to Mosul in neighbouring Iraq. 
		 French prosecutors have identified five of the seven dead assailants from Friday -- four Frenchmen and a man who was fingerprinted in Greece last month after arriving in the country via Turkey with a boatload of refugees fleeing the Syria war. 
		 Police believe two men directly involved in the assault subsequently escaped, including Salah Abdeslam, 26, a Belgian-based Frenchman who is accused of having played a central role in both planning and executing the deadly mission. 
		 French authorities said on Wednesday they had identified all the Nov. 13 victims. They came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. 
		 Empowered by a state of emergency introduced in France last Friday, police here have made hundreds of raids across the country over the past three days, arresting 60 suspects, putting 118 under house arrest and seizing 75 weapons. 
		 Until Wednesday morning, officials had said Abaaoud was in Syria. He grew up in Brussels, but media said he moved to Syria in 2014 to fight with Islamic State. Since then he has travelled back to Europe at least once and was involved in a series of planned attacks in Belgium foiled by the police last January. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters that the St. Denis cell was planning a fresh attack. "This new team was planning an attack on <mention id="2048">La Defense</mention>," one source said, referring to <mention id="2049">a high-rise neighbourhood on the outskirts of Paris that is home to top banks and businesses</mention>.

		 He was later arrested by police.

		* Corpse of militant found "riddled with impacts" 
		 * Abaaoud accused of orchestrating attacks that killed 129 
		 * PM announces death of Abaaoud to applause in parliament 
		 By John Irish and Gregory Blachier
		PARIS, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The suspected Islamic State mastermind of the Paris attacks was among those killed in a police raid north of the capital, France confirmed on Thursday, bringing an end to the hunt for Europe's most wanted man. 
		 Authorities said they had identified the corpse of Belgian national Abdelhamid Abaaoud from fingerprints in the aftermath of Wednesday's raid, in which at least two people died including a female suicide bomber after a gun battle with police. 
		 "It was his body we discovered in the building, riddled with impacts," a statement from the Paris prosecutor said, a day after the pre-dawn raid. The prosecutor later added that it was unclear whether Abaaoud had detonated a suicide belt. 
		 Abaaoud was accused of orchestrating last Friday's coordinated bombings and shootings in the French capital, which killed 129 people. Seven assailants died in the attack and a suspected eighth is still on the run. 
		 Prime Minister Manuel Valls broke the news of Abaaoud's death in parliament on Thursday to applause from lawmakers who were voting to extend a state of emergency for another three months. 
		 "We know today ... that the mastermind of the attacks - or one of them, let's remain cautious - was among those dead," Valls told reporters. 
		 Even before last week's attacks, Morroccan-born Abaaoud, 28, was one of Islamic State's highest-profile European recruits, prominently profiled in the group's slick online English-language magazine Dabiq, where he boasted of travelling across European borders staging attacks. 
		 The group, which controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, has attracted thousands of young Europeans, and Abaaoud was seen as a leading figure in attracting others to the movement, particularly from his home country Belgium. 
		 He claimed to have escaped a manhunt after a raid in Belgium in 2013 in which two other militants were killed. His own family has disowned him, accusing him of abducting his 13-year-old brother, who was later promoted on the Internet as Islamic State's youngest foreign fighter in Syria. 
		 Before the attacks, European governments thought Abaaoud was still in Syria. "This is a major failing," said Roland Jaquard at the International Observatory for Terrorism. 
		 While quickly tracking him down will be seen as a major success for French authorities, his presence in Paris will focus more attention on the difficulty European security services have in monitoring the continent's borders. 
		 French officials have called for changes to the functioning of the EU's Schengen zone, which normally does not monitor the entry and exit of citizens of its 26 countries. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have arrived in Europe as refugees in recent months, including someone who used a passport found at the scene of one of Friday's attacks. 
		 FIREFIGHT, EXPLOSIONS 
		 Early on Wednesday, police swooped on the house where Abaaoud was holed up in the Paris suburb of St. Denis. Heavily armed officers stormed the building before dawn, triggering a firefight and multiple explosions. 
		 Officials had said on Wednesday that two people were killed in the raid, including a female suicide bomber who blew herself up. Forensic scientists were trying to determine whether a third person had died. Eight people were arrested. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters the St. Denis cell had been planning a new attack on <mention id="2050">Paris's La Defense business district</mention>. A source close to the investigation said the female bomber who was killed might have been Abaaoud's cousin. 
		 The victims of the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out on a Friday night at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. 
		 Islamic State says it carried out the attacks in retaliation for French air raids against its positions over the past year. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the group and has launched air strikes on Raqqa, the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria, since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The aftermath of the attacks could see common cause between Western capitals and Moscow, more than a year after the United States and European Union imposed financial sanctions on Russia over its annexation of territory from Ukraine. 
		 Russia and the West are divided over Syria, with Moscow supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Western countries saying he must leave power to end a four-year-old civil war. Moscow launched air strikes in Syria six weeks ago and says it is targeting Islamic State, although most of its strikes have hit areas controlled by other groups opposed to Assad. 
		 There are signs however that the recognition of a common threat since the Paris shootings and the Russian air crash could prompt more efforts to cooperate. 
		 European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to President Vladimir Putin this week, suggesting closer trade ties between the 28-nation EU and a Russian-led economic bloc, linking them to progress on implementing a ceasefire in Ukraine. 
		 In the letter, seen by Reuters, Juncker underlined the importance of good relations between the European Union and Moscow, "which to my regret have not been able to develop over the past year". He said he had asked Commission officials to study options for closer ties between the EU and the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union of former Soviet states. 
		 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said he was surprised by the letter, which he said did not reflect a common view of EU member states and made no reference to EU sanctions. 
		 INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Two days before that, Hollande will meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to discuss the role of a U.S.-led coalition in any unified effort against Islamic State. 
		 France is one of several European countries participating in the U.S.-led coalition's strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq, and two months ago became the only European country to join strikes in Syria as well. 
		 Obama on Thursday reiterated the U.S. position that eradicating the group was tied up with ending the civil war in Syria, which could not happen as long as Assad was in power. 
		 "Bottom line is, I do not foresee a situation in which we can end the civil war in Syria while Assad remains in power," he told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.

<titre>WRAPUP 4-France, Belgium widen probe into Paris attacks, Hollande meets with Obama</titre>

		(Adds details of Hollande-Obama meeting, White House statement) 
		 * Belgium hunts for "dangerous" new suspect in attacks 
		 * Ringleader "returned to scenes of crime" - prosecutor 
		 * Hollande, Obama agree to step up strikes in Syria
		* Brussels still under lockdown as manhunt continues 
		 By Michel Rose and Philip Blenkinsop 
		 PARIS/BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - An investigation into the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris widened on Tuesday when French prosecutors said a man who provided lodging to the suspected ringleader must have known of a militant plot, and Belgium issued a warrant for a new suspect. 
		 Painting a chilling picture of ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Paris prosecutor said that after dropping off the gunmen and suicide bombers at the cafes and bars where the attacks were to take place, he later returned to the scene while the killing spree was in full swing. 
		 The coordinated attacks, in which 130 people were killed, prompted France to declare a national state of emergency and to step up air strikes in Syria on Islamic State, the militant group that has claimed responsibility. 
		 President Francois Hollande, seeking to rally global support for the military campaign against Islamic State, met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on Tuesday where they agreed to scale up operations against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. 
		 At a joint news conference, Hollande said he and Obama shared a "relentless determination to fight terrorism anywhere and everywhere." 
		 In Paris, prosecutor Francois Molins said Islamist militants who died during a shootout with police on Nov. 18 had been plotting an attack on <mention id="2051">the capital's business district</mention>. Reuters exclusively reported the plot to attack <mention id="2052">the district of La Defense</mention> on Nov. 18. 
		 Molins said he had put under formal investigation a Frenchman who had provided lodging for Abaaoud and his associates at the apartment in the suburb of St. Denis. 
		 "Jawad Bendaoud himself welcomed the terrorists on Nov. 17 towards 10:45 p.m. He could not have been in any doubt ... that he was taking part in a terrorist organisation," Molins told a news conference. 
		 Bendaoud said that before he was detained by police last Wednesday he had been asked to put up two people for three days in the apartment, but had no idea one of them may have been the suspected mastermind of the Nov. 13 attacks. 
		 Abaaoud died during the police raid along with Hasna Aitboulahcen, a woman believed to be his cousin, and an as yet unidentified third person. 
		 BRUSSELS LOCKDOWN 
		 French investigators are still piecing together exactly who did what when and have launched a hunt to find Salah Abdeslam, who is suspected of being the eighth attacker mentioned by Islamic State when it claimed responsibility. 
		 Abdeslam, 26, fled to Belgium the day after the shootings and his presumed presence in Brussels was one of the factors behind a security lockdown in the city over the past few days. 
		 Fearing an imminent Paris-style attack, Belgium has extended a maximum security alert in Brussels until next Monday. About half the stations on its metro system will reopen on Wednesday along with city schools, but 300 additional police officers and 200 soldiers will be deployed. 
		 Belgium has been at the heart of investigations into the attacks since France said two of the suicide bombers in Paris had lived there. Five people, including two who travelled with Abdeslam back to Brussels, have been charged with terrorist offences in Belgium. Abdeslam's brother, Brahim, blew himself up. 
		 Belgium's state prosecutor, in a statement announcing details of other people charged in the case, said on Tuesday it had issued an international arrest warrant for Mohamed Abrini, who was seen with Abdeslam two days before the attacks. 
		 Abrini, 30, was filmed with Abdeslam at a fuel station in northern France on Nov. 11 and was driving the Renault Clio car later used by the attackers in the French capital. 
		 A police wanted poster described Abrini as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 While major shopping centres in Brussels remained closed on Tuesday, two Ikea furniture stores on the edge of town reopened, along with some of the larger supermarkets in the city. 
		 The Magritte museum remained shut, however, and Brussels had yet to decide whether to open its Christmas market on Friday in the historic Grand Place, where workers have set up stalls with an armoured personnel carrier in the background. 
		 "We are at the time of year when we are supposed to have a lot of people, and increase business," said Brussels toy shop worker Laeticia Shalaj. "People are scared and are afraid of leaving their homes." 
		 Since the Paris killings, France has moved its flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier into the eastern Mediterranean to step up its bombardments of Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. 
		 France said late on Tuesday its warplanes had destroyed an Islamic State command centre at Tal Afar, some 45 km (28 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq. 
		 After talks with Hollande at the White House, Obama said: "We are here today to declare that the United States and France stand united in total solidarity to deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them and to defend our nations." 
		 As millions of Americans prepare to travel for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Obama acknowledged fear among Americans of a Paris-style attack in the United States. 
		 The White House said Obama was set to meet on Wednesday morning with his national security advisers to review the "homeland security posture" of the United States after the Paris attacks and "as we enter the holiday season. 
		 "The president was briefed that there is currently no specific, credible threat to the homeland" from Islamic State, the White House said. 
		 Hollande is due to visit Moscow on Thursday, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss ways of boosting their campaign to crush Islamic State. 
		 EXPLOSIVE BELT? 
		 Tracing Abdeslam's movements since the attacks has been a main focus of the investigations in Paris. An explosive belt was found dumped near the capital on Monday, close to a location where his mobile phone was detected the night after the attacks, the prosecutor said. 
		 Molins said the belt was similar to those used by the bombers during the Nov. 13 attacks, although it was still being established on Tuesday whether the belt was Abdeslam's. 
		 One theory was that Abdeslam had intended to blow himself up in the 18th district of Paris but had abandoned the plan, although it was not clear why.

<titre>Paris councillors back plan for first new skyscraper in 40 years</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		PARIS, June 30 (Reuters) - Paris city councillors voted on Tuesday in favour of hotly-contested plans for a giant triangular tower that would be the capital's first modern skyscraper in more than 40 years. 
		 The building, 180 metres (600 feet) high and vying on the skyline with the Eiffel Tower, will house a 120-room hotel and 70,000 square metres of office space.
		A common sight in most major capitals, skyscrapers have faced deep opposition in Paris ever since the 300-metre high Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 Universal Exposition. 
		 Paris' Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo diluted opposition to the new "Tour Triangle" last November after some of its planned office space was sacrificed for childcare and cultural centres. 
		 The building was designed by Basel-based architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, who were behind the conversion of London's Bankside Power Station into the Tate Modern art museum and Beijing's "Bird's Nest" National Stadium for the 2008 Olympics. 
		 Europe's biggest listed property group Unibail Rodamco is putting 500 million euro ($560 million) into the project, due to be completed in 2018. 
		 The last major skyscraper built within the city proper was the 59-floor, 210-metre Montparnasse building in southern Paris opened in 1973. Since then, most skyscrapers have been concentrated in <mention id="2053">the La Defense business district in the western outskirts</mention>. 
		 The "Tour Triangle" will be on the city's southwestern fringe in the Porte de Versailles neighbourhood, alongside vast convention halls.

<titre>WRAPUP 3-"Spider in web" mastermind of Paris attacks killed in raid</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Updates with details of French state of emergency, Belgium crackdown, minister) 
		 * Corpse of militant found riddled with holes 
		 * Abaaoud accused of orchestrating attacks that killed 129 
		 * PM announces death of Abaaoud to applause in parliament
		By John Irish and Gregory Blachier 
		 PARIS, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The suspected Islamic State mastermind of the Paris attacks was among those killed in a police raid north of the capital, France confirmed on Thursday, bringing an end to the hunt for Europe's most wanted man. 
		 Authorities said they had identified the mangled corpse of Belgian national Abdelhamid Abaaoud from fingerprints in the aftermath of Wednesday's raid and gunbattle in which at least two people died including a female suicide bomber. 
		 "The spider in the web is no longer a danger," Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens said, calling it a "breakthrough". 
		 The body had been found riddled with holes amid the wreckage in the aftermath of Wednesday's raid, Paris's prosecutor said in a statement. The prosecutor later added that it was unclear whether Abaaoud had detonated a suicide belt. 
		 The Moroccan-born Belgian militant, 28, was accused of orchestrating last Friday's coordinated bombings and shootings in the French capital, which killed 129 people. Seven assailants died in the attack and a suspected eighth is still on the run. 
		 French Prime Minister Manuel Valls broke the news of Abaaoud's death to parliament on Thursday to applause from French lawmakers who were voting to extend a state of emergency for three months. 
		 "We know today ... that the mastermind of the attacks - or one of them, let's remain cautious - was among those dead," Valls told reporters. 
		 PROMINENT RECRUITER 
		 Even before last week's attacks, Abaaoud was one of Islamic State's highest-profile European recruits, prominently profiled in the group's slick online English-language magazine Dabiq, where he boasted of crossing European borders to stage attacks. 
		 The group, which controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, has attracted thousands of young Europeans, and Abaaoud was seen as a leading figure in luring others to join, particularly from his home country Belgium. 
		 He claimed to have escaped a continent-wide manhunt after a police raid in Belgium in 2013 in which two other militants were killed. His own family has disowned him, accusing him of abducting his 13-year-old brother, who was later promoted on the Internet as Islamic State's youngest foreign fighter in Syria. 
		 While quickly tracking him down will be seen as a major success for French authorities, his presence in Paris will focus more attention on the difficulty European security services have in monitoring the continent's borders. 
		 Before the attacks, European governments thought Abaaoud was still in Syria. "This is a major failing," said Roland Jaquard at the International Observatory for Terrorism. 
		 French officials have called for changes to the functioning of the EU's Schengen border-free travel zone, which normally does not monitor the entry and exit of citizens of its 26 countries. Hundreds of thousands of people have reached Europe as Syrian refugees in recent months, including at least one person using a passport found at the scene of Friday's attacks. 
		 Lawmakers in the French National Assembly voted to extend the state of emergency for three months by 551 votes to six. The state of emergency allows police to search homes without a judicial warrant and impose house arrest on suspects, among other measures. 
		 "FACED WITH BARBARISM" 
		 "This is the fast response of a democracy faced with barbarism. This is the effective legal response in the face of an ideology of chaos," Valls told parliament. 
		 Neighbouring Belgium, stung by revelations that several of the attackers were based there, announced a 400 million euro ($430 million) security crackdown. Prime Minister Charles Michel announced plans for new laws to jail jihadis returning from Syria, shut unregistered mosques, expel hate preachers and ban anonymous purchases of mobile phone cards. 
		 Heavily armed French police swooped on the house where Abaaoud was holed up in the Paris suburb of St. Denis on Wednesday before dawn, triggering a huge firefight and multiple explosions. 
		 Officials had said on Wednesday that two people were killed in the raid, including a female suicide bomber. Forensic scientists were trying to determine whether a third person had died. Eight people were arrested. 
		 French police sources say the St. Denis cell had been planning a new attack on <mention id="2054">Paris's La Defense business district</mention>. 
		 The victims of the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out on a Friday night at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. Islamic State says it carried out the attacks in retaliation for French air raids on its positions. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the group and has launched air strikes on Raqqa, the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria, since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The attacks could bring common cause between Western capitals and Moscow, more than a year after the United States and European Union imposed financial sanctions on Russia over its annexation of territory from Ukraine. 
		 Russia and the West are divided over Syria, with Moscow supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Western countries saying he must leave power to end a 4-year-old civil war. Moscow launched air strikes in Syria six weeks ago and says it is targeting Islamic State, although most of its strikes have hit areas controlled by other groups opposed to Assad. 
		 There are signs that the recognition of a common threat since the Paris shootings and the Russian air crash could prompt more efforts to cooperate. 
		 RUSSIA'S ROLE 
		 European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to President Vladimir Putin this week, suggesting closer trade ties between the 28-nation EU and a Russian-led economic bloc, linking them to progress on implementing a ceasefire in Ukraine. 
		 In the letter, seen by Reuters, Juncker underlined the importance of good relations between the European Union and Moscow, "which to my regret have not been able to develop over the past year". He said he had asked Commission officials to study options for closer ties between the EU and the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union of former Soviet states. 
		 French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Two days before that, Hollande will meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to discuss the role of a U.S.-led coalition in any unified effort against Islamic State. 
		 France is one of several European countries participating in the U.S.-led Operation Inherent Resolve strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq, and two months ago became the only European country to join U.S.-led strikes in Syria as well. 
		 Obama on Thursday reiterated the U.S. position that eradicating the group was tied up with ending the civil war in Syria, which could not happen as long as Assad was in power. 
		 "Bottom line is, I do not foresee a situation in which we can end the civil war in Syria while Assad remains in power," he told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.

<titre>FACTBOX-The hunt for the Paris attackers</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Nov 30 (Reuters) - France and Belgium are hunting suspects and would-be attackers following the shootings and bombings in Paris on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and injured hundreds. 
		 Eight attackers are dead and the total number of assailants may have been 10 or higher. Investigations are centred on Salah Abdeslam, who police think might be an assailant referred to in statement in which militant group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.
		Here is what we know about the suspects and the wider circle pursued by police as attention focuses on the Belgian warning that there is a "serious and imminent" danger in Brussels. 
		 KEY EVENTS: Nov 13: France. Seven assailants dead: three at the Bataclan concert hall, three outside the Stade de France stadium and one of three gunmen involved in the cafe killings. Nov 18: France. Three people died and eight were arrested in a police assault on a hideout flat in St. Denis, north of Paris. One of the three is identified as suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who also played a direct role in the cafe shootings, prosecutor Francois Molins said. Nov 21 onwards: Belgium reports a serious and imminent danger of Paris-style attacks, deploying soldiers on the streets of Brussels and conducting police searches for would-be attackers and suspects with links to the Paris attacks. Nov 26: Belgium eases maximum alert level in Brussels. 
		 UNACCOUNTED FOR: 
		 Salah Abdeslam, 26, French, born in Brussels (Sept. 15, 1989). Suspected of having rented the VW Polo and Renault Clio cars used in the attacks. Investigators say he went to Belgium from France the day after the attacks in a VW Golf, despite being stopped by French police along the way in routine road checks before his name was circulated as a suspect. 
		 His brother Brahim died in the attack (below). A third brother, cleared of any involvement after briefly being detained, said Salah may have had a change of heart in Paris. 
		 However, fears that Salah is back in Belgium and/or plotting attacks prompted closure of Brussels underground rail lines, schools, shopping centres and other public places on Nov. 20. The protective shutdown was partially lifted as of Nov. 25. 
		 French police are examining a suicide belt dumped in Montrouge on the southwestern fringes of Paris, where phone traces suggested Salah was present on the night of Nov. 13. 
		 Investigators are trying to establish whether Salah Abdeslam was supposed to carry out an attack in Paris's 18th district but for some reason did not, prosecutor Molins said. 
		 In its statement, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack in the 18th district that did not happen. 
		 The last person known to have seen Abdeslam, Ali Oulkadi, said he gave him a lift across Brussels on Nov. 14 and when he dropped him off Abdeslam said: "You'll never see me again." 
		 Mohamed Abrini, 30, Belgian of Moroccan origin, seen by police on video footage with Salah at a car fuelling station in Ressons, a town north of Paris near the motorway linking Belgium to the French capital, on Nov. 11, two days before the attacks. The Renault Clio the two were seen in was one of the cars used in the attacks. A Belgian police notice describes Abrini, who has fought in Syria and came from the same Brussels area as the Abdeslam brothers and Abdelhamid Abaaoud, as "dangerous and probably armed". 
		 DEAD ATTACKERS: 
		 Bataclan: (3 dead gunmen with suicide vests, two named) Ismail Omar Mostefai, 29 (born Nov. 21, 1985), Frenchman of Algerian descent involved in the Bataclan attack, lived for a time in Chartres area, southwest of Paris. Born in Courcouronnes, south of Paris. Source: prosecutor's office and judiciary sources. His name was put on French intelligence services' "S notice" in 2010 for reported radicalisation. An unnamed senior Turkish government official says Turkey contacted France about Mostefai in December 2014 and June 2015 but only got a return request for information on him after the Paris attacks.. 
		 Samy Amimour, 28 (born Oct. 15, 1987), involved in the Bataclan attack. French, from Drancy near St. Denis. Subject of international arrest warrant since late 2013. Had been under official investigation since October 2012 on suspicion of terrorism-related activity over a plan to go to Yemen. Source: Paris prosecutor's office statement. Amimour, a bus driver who had been radicalised in a mosque near Drancy, was ordered by police to check in with them every week but missed four checks in 2013. It was only after nearly a month that the authorities put out an international arrest warrant for him but he was already in Syria. Other: A third attacker in the Bataclan attack was shot dead by police. No further identity information has been provided. 
		 Cafe killings: (3 gunmen, 2 identified) Brahim Abdeslam, 31 (born July 30, 1984), French citizen but born and raised in Brussels, where he ran a bar in the Molenbeek district with brother Salah. Blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in wake of the shootings. His fingerprints were on one of the AK-47 rifles left in a Seat Leon used in the attacks. 
		 Presumed ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, Belgian, grew up in the Molenbeek district of Brussels, but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria where he was one of Islamic States most high-profile European recruits. Local media say he was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time in prison alongside Salah Abdeslam. Before the attacks, European governments believed Abaaoud was still in Syria, having been in Belgium in January plotting attacks that were foiled when police raided a house in Verviers, killing two Belgian associates. 
		 Prosecutor Molins confirmed on Nov. 24 that Abaaoud both took part in the cafe shootings and returned to the killing scenes while the Bataclan attack was still underway on the night of Nov. 13. He also said Abaaoud and another man were believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack on <mention id="2055">the La Defense business district</mention> in the west of Paris on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 Closed circuit TV footage showed Abaaoud entering the Croix de Chavaux metro railway station in eastern Paris with another man on Nov. 13, a couple of hundred metres from where the Seat Leon used in the cafe shootings was found. His fingerprints were found on one of three AK-47 assault rifles left in the car. Other: a third gunman who took part in the cafe shootings has not been identified. Investigators say the DNA of a person who blew himself up during a police raid on Nov. 18 in St. Denis matches traces found on one of the AK-47 rifles in the abandoned Seat and that may mean he is the third person who took part in the cafe shootings. Stade de France: (3 dead suicide bombers who used vests containing bolts, 1 named) Bilal Hadfi, 20 (born Jan 22, 1995). Blew himself up in the Nov. 13 attack on Stade de France stadium. He dropped out of school in Brussels in February 2014 to travel to Syria. Believing he was back, police bugged his apartment but he did not show up. Other: A man blew himself up outside Gate D at the Stade de France. A passport found near his dead body has the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, 25, (born Sept. 10, 1990), from Idlib, northwest Syria. His fingerprints match up with prints of a person registered under that name as arriving in Greece in Oct. 3, 2015. Source: French prosecutor's office. It has not been confirmed that the bomber is the man in the passport. Other: The fingerprints of a third man who blew himself up outside Gate H of the Stade de France show that he passed through Greece at the same time as the other unidentified stadium suicide bomber, prosecutors say. Police have published a photo in an appeal for help to identify the man. 
		 OTHER DEAD: 
		 Hasna Aitboulahcen: woman, 26, who suffocated under rubble in the Nov. 18 police assault in St. Denis, said prosecutor Francois Molins. Police were tapping her phone as part of a drugs probe and watched her lead Abaaoud back to the apartment before the raid. Abaaoud and another man apparently called her in haste on Nov. 17 from where they were hiding in bushes to find them a hideout. 
		 Other: The third person who died in Nov. 18 St. Denis assault may have been the third gunmen involved in the cafe shootings but this has yet to be confirmed. 
		 DETAINED: 
		 In France: Jawad Bendaoud, one of eight arrested in St. Denis swoop, who provided lodgings for Abaaoud. Jawad told French TV as he was being led away to custody on Nov. 18 that he was unaware he had helped suspected terrorists. 
		 Prosecutor Molins said Bendaoud was in contact before and after the attacks with a person using a Belgian phone who was in turn in phone contact with the attackers. 
		 The other seven arrested, five of whom are thought to be illegal squatters who had taken refuge in the same building, according to police sources, were released after questioning. 
		 In a sweep facilitated by state of emergency rules, police said since Nov. 13 they had conducted 1,233 searches of homes of people suspected of Islamist links (not directly related to attacks), taking 124 into custody. They had confiscated 230 weapons, according to the Interior Ministry as of Nov. 24. 
		 In Turkey: Ahmet Dahmani, a Belgian man of Moroccan origin suspected of some form of involvement in the Paris attack was arrested by police in Turkey on Nov. 21, a government official said. A Turkish news agency said he acted as a 'scout' in selecting target locations. Dahmani, 26, was arrested at a luxury hotel in the southern Turkish coastal city of Antalya after travelling from Amsterdam on Nov. 14. Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, the official said. 
		 In Belgium: Six have been placed under formal investigation on terrorism-related charges so far after more than two dozen arrests. 
		 Mohammad Amri, 27, and Hamza Attouh, 21, went to Paris by car shortly after the attacks to fetch Salah Abdeslam and bring him back to Belgium on Nov. 14. 
		 Lazez Abraimi, 39, Moroccan living in western Brussels. His lawyers say he admits taking Salah somewhere in Brussels in his car but knows nothing else. Abraimi's brother is in Syria but he himself is not a radical. He deals in bric-a-brac, hence the two handguns in his car, one of which was a signal pistol. The blood in his car is not that of Salah, his lawyer says. 
		 Ali Oulkadi, 31, a Frenchman living in Molenbeek, western Brussels, accused of driving Salah in Brussels on Nov. 14. His lawyer says Oulkadi dropped him off north of the city centre. 
		 Fifth person. Age 35, from western Brussels. Detained in Brussels on Nov. 23. No other details. 
		 Sixth person. Detained in Brussels on Thursday. No details. 
		 Regarding Amri and Attouh, lawyer Xavier Carette said his client Amri was an unwitting accomplice who knew nothing about any role in attacks when he drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels on night of Nov. 13-14. A lawyer for Attouh quoted him as saying that Abdeslam was "extremely tense" and may have still been wearing a suicide belt under his down jacket. 
		 Mohammad Abdeslam, brother of Salah and dead Brahim, was among five released after arrests on Nov. 19. More than two dozen people in total have been detained and release in Belgium. (Compiled by Brian Love with reporters in Paris and Brussels; Editing by Tom Heneghan)

Other: A third attacker in the Bataclan attack was killed by police. No further identity information has been provided. 
		 Cafe killings: (3 involved, 2 identified) 
		 Brahim Abdeslam, 31 (born July 30, 1984), French citizen but born and raised in Brussels, where he ran a bar in the Molenbeek district with brother Salah. Blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in wake of the cafe shootings. His fingerprints were found on one of the AK47 rifles left in a Seat Leon car used in the attacks. 
		 Ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28, grew up in the Molenbeek district of Brussels, but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria. Local media say he was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time in prison alongside Salah Abdeslam. Before the attacks, European governments believed Abaaoud was still in Syria, having been in Belgium in January plotting attacks that were foiled when police raided a house in Verviers, killing two Belgian associates. 
		 Prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed on Nov. 24 that Abaaoud both took part in the cafe killings and returned to the killing scenes in Paris after the event on the night of Nov. 13. He also said Abaaoud and another man were believed to be preparing a suicide bomb attack on <mention id="2056">the La Defense business district</mention> in the west of Paris on Nov. 18 or 19. 
		 Closed circuit TV footage showed Abaaoud entering the Croix de Chavaux metro railway station in eastern Paris with another man on Nov. 13, a couple of hundred metres from where the Seat Leon used in the cafe shootings was found, police say. His fingerprints were found on one of three AK47 assault rifles left in the car. 
		 Stade de France: (three dead suicide bombers, 1 named) Bilal Hadfi, 20 (born Jan 22, 1995). Blew himself up in the Nov. 13 attack on Stade de France stadium. He dropped out of school in Brussels in February 2014 to travel to Syria. Believing he was back, police bugged his apartment but he did not show up. Other: A man blew himself up outside Gate D at the Stade de France. A passport found near his dead body has the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, 25, (born Sept. 10, 1990), from Idlib, northwest Syria. His fingerprints match up with prints of a person registered under that name as arriving in Greece in Oct. 3, 2015. Source: French prosecutor's office. It has not been confirmed that the bomber is the man in the passport. Other: The fingerprints of a third man who blew himself up outside Gate H of the Stade de France show that he passed through Greece at the same time as the other unidentified stadium suicide bomber, prosecutors say. Police have published a photo in an appeal for help to identify the man. 
		 OTHER DEAD: 
		 Hasna Aitboulahcen: woman, 26, who suffocated under rubble in the Nov. 18 police assault in St. Denis, said prosecutor Francois Molins. Police were tapping her phone as part of a drugs probe and watched her lead Abaaoud back to the apartment before the raid. Abaaoud and another man apparently called her in haste from a bush where they were hiding to find them a hideout on Nov. 17. 
		 Other: Third person who died in Nov. 18 St. Denis assault. Investigators say the person's DNA matched trades found on one of the AK-47 rifles found in the abandoned Seat and that may mean he is the third man involved in the cafe shootings. 
		 DETAINED: 
		 In France: Jawad Bendaoud, one of eight arrested in St. Denis swoop, who provided lodgings for Abaaoud. Jawad told French TV as he was being led away to custody on Nov. 18 that he was unaware he had helped suspected terrorists. 
		 Prosecutor Francois Molins said Bendaoud was in contact before and after the attacks with a person using a Belgian phone who was in turn known to have been in phone contact with the attackers. 
		 The other seven arrested, five of whom are thought to be illegal squatters who had taken refuge in the same building, according to police sources, were released after questioning. 
		 In a sweep facilitated by state of emergency rules, police said since Nov. 13 they had conducted 1,233 searches of homes of people suspected of Islamist links (not directly related to attacks), taking 124 into custody. They had confiscated 230 weapons, of which half were army-grade or rifle-size, according to readouts from the Interior Ministry as of Nov. 24. 
		 In Turkey: Ahmet Dahmani, a Belgian man of Moroccan origin suspected of some form of involvement in the Paris attack was arrested by police in Turkey on Nov. 21, a government official said. A Turkish news agency said he acted as a 'scout' in selecting target locations. Dahmani, 26, was arrested at a luxury hotel in the southern Turkish coastal city of Antalya after travelling from Amsterdam on Nov. 14. Two suspected accomplices were also arrested, the official said. 
		 In Belgium: Five have been detained on suspicion of terrorist-related so far after dozens of arrests. Only two have been named. 
		 The two detained on Nov. 14, Mohammad Amri, 27, and Hamza Attouh, 21, went to Paris by car shortly after the attacks to fetch Salah Abdeslam and bring him back to Belgium. 
		 The three others, not named, include one person arrested on Nov. 19 for possession of weapons and another arrested on Nov. 22 on charges of links to an attack. 
		 Regarding the named men, lawyer Xavier Carette said his client Amri was an unwitting accomplice who knew nothing about any role in attacks when he drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels on night of Nov. 13-14. A lawyer for Attouh quoted him as saying that Abdeslam was "extremely tense" and may have still been wearing a suicide belt under his down jacket.

		(Adds New York police on new Islamic State video, White House on no credible threat to U.S.) 
		 * At least two die, eight arrested in pre-dawn raid 
		 * Group was planning to attack <mention id="2057">business district</mention> -sources 
		 * Raid aimed at alleged Nov. 13 attack mastermind
		* Unclear if Belgian militant among those killed 
		 By Emmanuel Jarry and Antony Paone 
		 SAINT DENIS, France, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew herself up in a police raid on Wednesday that sources said had foiled a jihadi plan to hit <mention id="2058">Paris's business district</mention>, days after a wave of attacks killed 129 across the French capital. 
		 Police stormed an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis before dawn in a hunt for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian militant accused of masterminding the bombings and shootings, but it was unclear whether he had died in the assault. 
		 Heavily armed officers triggered a massive firefight and multiple explosions when they entered the building. Eight people were arrested, and forensic scientists were working to confirm if two or three militants had died in the violence. 
		 "A new team of terrorists has been neutralised," Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters on Wednesday evening, saying police fired 5,000 rounds of munitions into the apartment, which was left shredded by the raid, its windows blown out and the facade riddled with bullet impacts. 
		 "This commando could have become operational," Molins said. 
		 A source close to the investigation said the dead woman might have been Abaaoud's cousin, while the Washington Post quoted senior intelligence officials as saying Abaaoud himself had died in the shoot-out. 
		 Molins said none of the bodies had been identified, adding only that Abaaoud was not among those detained. 
		 Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters the St. Denis cell was planning a fresh attack. "This new team was planning an attack on <mention id="2059">La Defense</mention>," one source said, referring to <mention id="2060">a high-rise neighbourhood on the outskirts of Paris that is home to top banks and businesses</mention>. 
		 In another sign that Islamic State supporters were active elsewhere in France, a Jewish teacher was stabbed in the southern French port of Marseilles by three people professing solidarity with the militant group, prosecutors said. 
		 One of the three wore an Islamic State T-shirt, while another attacker showed a picture on his mobile telephone of Mohamed Merah, a homegrown Islamist militant who killed seven people in attacks in southern France in 2012. The Marseilles teacher's life was not in danger. 
		 Police were led to the apartment in St. Denis following a tip that Abaaoud, 28, previously thought to have orchestrated the Nov. 13 attacks from Syria, was actually in France. 
		 Investigators believe the attacks - the worst atrocity in France since World War Two - were set in motion in Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 Molins said an initial attempt to blow in the front door had failed because it was metal-plated, giving those inside time to pick up their guns and fight back. The confrontation was so violent part of the apartment building was in danger of collapsing. 
		 Local resident Sanoko Abdulai said that during the operation a young woman detonated an explosion. 
		 "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up," he told Reuters. Five police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was also killed. 
		 GLOBAL ALERTS 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 Anxiety has mounted across the globe about the threat of more attacks. 
		 Police in New York, the target of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide plane attacks, said they were aware of a newly released Islamic State video suggesting America's most populous city was a potential target. 
		 A clip of the six-minute video provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks militant groups, shows a brief glimpse of Times Square and then a suicide bomber holding what appears to be a trigger. 
		 "While there is no current or specific threat to the city at this time, we will remain at a heightened state of vigilance," Deputy New York Police Commissioner Stephen Davis. 
		 U.S. President Barack Obama's top adviser on counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco, told cable channel MSNBC there was "no credible threat" against the United States at the moment. 
		 Sweden raised its threat level by one step to four on a scale of five. The high-speed Eurostar train that connects Paris and London briefly suspended check-ins at Paris's Gare du Nord, and several German Bundesliga soccer teams said they were beefing up security before their matches. 
		 SEEKING GLOBAL COALITION 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the extremists and has launched three air strikes on Raqqa, the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria, since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224. 
		 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Wednesday the bombardments had killed at least 33 Islamic State militants over the past three days. 
		 Citing activists, the Observatory said Islamic State members and dozens of families of senior members had started fleeing Raqqa to relocate to Mosul in neighbouring Iraq. 
		 The Russian air force on Wednesday carried out a "mass strike" on Islamic State positions around Syria, including Raqqa, Russian news agencies reported. 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Two days before that, Hollande will meet in Washington with U.S. President Barack Obama, who says Russia must shift its focus from "propping up" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
		 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Western nations had to drop their demands for Assad's exit if they wanted to build a coalition against Islamic State. 
		 Russia is allied to Assad, but the West says he must go if there is to be a political solution to Syria's prolonged civil war. Hollande said countries should set aside their sometimes diverging national interests to battle their common foe. 
		 VICTIMS IDENTIFIED 
		 French prosecutors have identified five of the seven dead assailants from Friday - four Frenchmen and a man fingerprinted in Greece last month after arriving in the country via Turkey with a boatload of refugees fleeing the Syria war. 
		 Police believe two men directly involved in the assault subsequently escaped, including Salah Abdeslam, 26, a Belgian-based Frenchman accused of having played a central role in both planning and executing the deadly mission. 
		 French authorities said on Wednesday they had identified all the victims from Friday's attacks. They came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. 
		 Empowered by a state of emergency introduced in France after the attacks, police have made hundreds of raids across the country over the past three days, arresting 60 suspects, putting 118 under house arrest and seizing 75 weapons. 
		 Until Wednesday morning, officials had said Abaaoud was in Syria. He grew up in Brussels, but media said he moved to Syria in 2014 to fight with Islamic State. Since then, he has travelled back to Europe at least once and was involved in a series of planned attacks in Belgium foiled by the police last January.

		 By Antony Paone and Emmanuel Jarry 
		 SAINT DENIS, France, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and another militant died on Wednesday when police raided an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis seeking suspects in last week's attacks in the French capital. 
		 Officials said police had been hunting Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian Islamist militant accused of masterminding the Nov. 13 carnage, but more than seven hours after the launch of the pre-dawn raid it was still unclear if they had found him. 
		 Seven people were arrested in the operation, which started with a barrage of gunfire, including three people who were pulled from the apartment, officials said. 
		 "It is impossible to tell you who was arrested. We are in the process of verifying that. Everything will be done to determine who is who," Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said at the end of the operation. 
		 Molins said the assault was ordered after phone taps and surveillance operations led police to believe that Abaaoud might have been in St. Denis, near to the soccer stadium which was site of one of the attacks that hit Paris last week. 
		 A total of 129 people died in the coordinated bombings and shootings. Investigators believe the worst atrocity in France since World War Two was set in motion from Syria, with Islamist cells in neighbouring Belgium organising the mayhem. 
		 Two police sources say investigators believe the St. Denis group had been planning an attack on <mention id="2061">the French capital's La Defense business capital</mention>. 
		 Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St. Denis just before 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT). 
		 "We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake," said Sabrine, a downstairs neighbour from the apartment that was raided. 
		 She told Europe 1 radio that she heard the people above her talking to each other, running around and reloading their guns. 
		 Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion. 
		 "She had a bomb, that's for sure. The police didn't kill her, she blew herself up...," he told Reuters, without giving details. 
		 Three police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was killed. 
		 FLEEING RAQQA 
		 Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year. 
		 France has called for a global coalition to defeat the radicals and has launched three large air strikes on Raqqa -- the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria.

		 A man in St. Denis told reporters that he had rented out the besieged apartment to two people last week. 
		 "Someone asked me a favour, I did them a favour. Someone asked me to put two people up for three days and I did them a favour, it's normal. I don't know where they came from I don't know anything," the man told Reuters Television. 
		 He was later arrested by police. 
		 FALSE ALERT 
		 Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said two Paris-bound Air France flights were diverted following anonymous bomb threats, and hundreds of passengers and crew were safely removed. 
		 Authorities in the United States and Canada, where the planes landed, later said both aircraft had been searched and were safe. 
		 Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries' militaries might work together. 
		 Hollande is due to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington two days before that to push for a concerted drive against Islamic State, which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq.

<titre>Experimental study on the thermal properties of lightweight aggregate concretes at different moisture contents and ambient temperatures.</titre>

		 ABSTRACT 
		 This study reports the influence of moisture content and temperature on the thermal properties of lightweight aggregate concretes. Seven types of coarse and fine lightweight aggregates from three different natures were used. The thermal tests were performed on concrete samples at three different moisture conditions: dry state, partial saturation state and saturated state. At the dry state, measures have been taken at four different temperatures: 5[degrees]C, 20[degrees]C, 35[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C. The results show a great dependence of thermal conductivity and specific heat of lightweight aggregate concretes on the moisture content. However, concrete thermal diffusivity is not much influenced by the moisture state. These variations are discussed as a function of the type of lightweight aggregate and it volume fraction. The thermal conductivity increases with the temperature between 5 and 35[degrees]C and then stabilizes between 35 and 50[degrees]C.

		 1. Introduction 
		 Recent studies have shown the better thermal performance of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) compared to normal strength concrete [1-5], Use of appropriate mixes could lead to the LWAC with sufficient mechanical strength for structural use [1-10]. In most cases, structural lightweight aggregate concretes are made of coarse lightweight aggregate (LWA) and fine normal-weight aggregate (NWA) [2-11]. LWA used in the structural lightweight concretes are frequently expanded clay, expanded shale or pumice [2,6-13], Nguyen et al. [1] showed that using fine LWA instead of fine NWA allows reducing the concrete density, thus increasing its insulating capacity, without much lowering the mechanical performance of LWAC. The replacement of fine aggregate can lead to a decrease up to 70% of the thermal conductivity of structural LWAC [1]. 
		 Up to now, the influence of moisture content on the thermal properties of LWAC is not much studied. We can mention here some studies on the properties of wood-concrete and autoclaved concrete [14-17], However, in real conditions, new concrete is well saturated and dries very slowly. Concrete do not remain in saturated state and will not reach the dry state as drying in oven. In practice, the concrete structure is subjected to variations in temperature and humidity during its life. Furthermore, heat transfer in a concrete is more complex than in other materials. The concrete is not only a composite material, but concrete components are also porous media where there are solid, liquid and air/vapor phases. The air's moisture variation could modify the liquid water content in concrete, by condensation of water vapor in the pores. Thus the LWAC could be more sensitive to ambient humidity than ordinary concretes with NWA. Because of the higher thermal conductivity of liquid water compared to that of air, heat transfer by conduction increases with the moisture content. The works presented in [14-16] showed that the thermal conductivity of concretes increases with the moisture content. According to [14], the concrete thermal conductivity varies linearly with concrete moisture content. The influence of moisture content on the conductivity and diffusivity of the wood-concrete was studied by Taoukil et al. [16]. The experimental evolution of wood-concrete thermal properties with moisture content was described by non-linear theoretical models. 
		 The study on the thermal behavior of lightweight concretes at ambient temperature range is still very limited. Some studies [25,17-20] gave the thermal properties of LWAC at one specific condition of temperature and moisture content. Other thermal studies rather concern the high temperature behavior of concretes [21,22]. Study of Marechal [21] showed that the thermal conductivity of the concrete made of siliceous aggregates (quartz) increases with the ambient temperature, reaches a peak at about 50-60[degrees]C and then decreases. For LWAC, Kim et al. [23] noticed an increase of the conductivity with temperatures ranging from 0[degrees]C to 50[degrees]C. Same observations were showed in [24] for normal-weight concretes in the temperature range 20[degrees]C-60[degrees]C. The concrete thermal conductivity decreases with the temperature over 60-80[degrees]C [21]. The effect of temperature on the conductivity can be explained by the concrete moisture content [21,25]. The thermal conductivity of the water increases with temperature, leading to increase in thermal conductivity of the concrete for temperatures lower than 50-60[degrees]C. For higher temperatures, free water and adsorbed water escape from the concrete leading to the decrease of concrete thermal conductivity. However, this explanation on the concrete conductivity --temperature relationship makes less sense for concretes in dry state. The specific heat of concrete also depends on temperature. Mindess [26] indicated that the temperature has significant impacts on the specific heat of cement paste and concrete. The specific heat of normal-weight concretes can vary from 800 to 1200 J/kg[degrees]C following the temperature variation. 
		 In this context, the aim of this study is to analyze the influence of moisture content and temperature on the thermal properties of LWAC. The coarse and fine LWA used in this study are expanded clay, expanded shale and pumice. LWAC have a density lower than 1600 kg/[m.sup.3] and a compressive strength not less than 20 MPa. In order to study the influence of moisture content in LWAC on its thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal diffusivity, three different sample conditionings are taken into account. The thermal properties of LWAC are also analyzed in the temperature range between 5[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C. In the first part of this paper, the physical properties, the chemical and mineralogical composition of LWA are presented. The measurements of density, water absorption and porosity provide information, not only for the mix design but also for the knowledge of LWA microstructure. Secondly, the concrete mixes and testing procedures are explained. An experimental protocol of LWAC sorption is undertaken in order to study the thermal properties of LWAC in a partial saturation state. The thermal tests were carried out using a Hot Disk device. Thermal conductivity and diffusivity of concretes were measured and their specific heats were deduced. In the last section, main results on thermal properties of LWAC depending on the moisture contents and on the temperatures are discussed. 
		 2. Material's properties 
		 In this study, seven types of LWA of expanded shale, pumice and expanded clay were used. Aggregate densities and water absorptions were determined. There is no adequate procedure to measure the thermal properties of LWA because of its small size and its polyhedron form. The knowledge of LWA density and porosity will help us estimating the influence of LWA on the thermal performances of LWAC. LWA have usually great difference of thermal properties comparing to NWA and cement paste. Thus LWA, which occupies from 65 to 75% of concrete volume fraction, has a great influence on the thermal properties of LWAC and insulating performance of LWAC structures. Besides, chemical and mineralogical compositions of LWA are also important data to analyze the influence of LWA nature on thermal properties of LWAC. Other factors that influence the thermal properties of concrete are the total porosity and pores distribution of LWA, presented in [1]. 
		 2.1. Aggregate density and water absorption 
		 In the following, the studied LWA are named by their sizes and their natures: S for expanded shale, P for pumice and C for expanded clay. Three fine LWA (0/5 or 0/4 mm) and four coarse LWA (4/10 or 4/8 mm) were tested. 
		 The LWA density and water absorption capacity must be taken into account when determining the volume of LWA to be added to the mixture. The bulk density ([[rho.sub.v]) was measured according to the standard EN 1097-3. The oven-dry particle density ([[rho.sub.rd]) and the water absorption coefficients in% mass at 24 h ([W.sup.24.sub.a]) and 48 h ([W.sup.48.sub.a]) of LWA are presented in Table 1. These properties were measured according to the EN 1097-6. The properties of fine NWA 0/2 mm are added. Three different samples were tested for each aggregate type and the average value is reported in Table 1. 
		 For LWA, fine aggregates are commonly heavier than coarse aggregates, with bulk densities from 800 to 1030 kg/[m.sup.3] and from 520 to 740 kg/[m.sup.3], respectively. 0/5 P pumice is the lightest fine LWA. 5/8 P pumice and 4/8 C expanded clay are heavier than other coarse LWA according to their low grain diameter. The two aggregate pairs 4/10 S - 4/10 C and 4/8 C - 5/8 P, each of which have a similar size and density, allow investigating the influence of other physical parameters such as nature, porosity and pore size distribution of LWA on the properties of LWAC. 
		 The expanded shale aggregates have the lowest water absorption coefficients at 24 h and 48 h. Expanded shale and expanded clay aggregates exhibit a porous internal structure surrounded by a shell, which is a relatively dense vitrified surface. The shell of the shale LWA 4/10 S is thicker than that of the clay LWA 4/10 C (6). This surface property explains the lower water absorption coefficient of 4/10 S compared to that of 4/10 C. Although fine LWA 0/4 S shale is crushed from bigger aggregates so that its low-permeation outer shell disappears, it has the lowest water absorption coefficient due to its highest density. Pumice LWA is crushed aggregate. There is no difference between internal and external structure. Water absorption coefficients are similar for fine 0/5 P and coarse 5/8 P pumice LWA. With comparable densities, pumice fine LWA and clay fine LWA have similar water absorption coefficient, which is about 18% at 24 h (Table 1). The water absorption coefficient of the three expanded clay aggregates increases logically with the decrease of density. The [W.sup.48.sub.a] coefficient is 19.2, 20.4 and 26.4% respectively for aggregate dry density of 1410, 1240 and 980 kg/[m.sup.3], respectively. The measured water absorption coefficient at 48 h was used to calculate the proportions of the concrete mixtures (cf. Section 3.1). 
		 2.2. Chemical and mineralogical composition of lightweight aggregates 
		 The chemical composition of the used LWA, provided by producers, is presented in Table 2. All aggregates contain a high percentage of silica, from 60 to 72%. Expanded shale and clay have also high percentage of alumina and ferrite oxide. Pumice has less alumina than the two other aggregates and its ferrite content is very much lower and even negligible. Due to the higher atomic mass of the iron, the density of the solid part of the clay and shale LWA should be higher than that of the pumice LWA. 
		 The mineralogy of the pumice, shale and clay aggregates was determined by XDR analysis. Samples were scanned with a Philips diffractometer using copper Ka radiation. The wavelength of the incident X-ray is equal to 1.54 A. The diffractometer was running at 40 kV and 20 mA. The step widths was 0.025[degrees] from 6 to 66[degrees] 2-theta and 0.0025[degrees] from 64 to 70[degrees] 2-theta. The counting time was 1.5 s per step. XRD data are can be viewed in [1]. The results showed the vitreous nature of pumice. Expanded shale and expanded clay aggregates have a crystalline structure. They contain quartz, iron oxide and feldspar (orthoclase and plagioclase) as principal mineral phases. The shale and clay aggregates have also iron oxide. The clay one shows small amounts of amorphous aluminosilicate produced during the thermal expansion process. This observation allows investigating the influence of the mineralogy on the thermal properties of LWAC in the last section. 
		 3. Experimental procedure 
		 In this section, the mix design of twelve LWAC is described. Only experiment procedure for thermal tests on LWA is presented. Measurement procedure for physical and mechanical properties can be viewed in [1]. 
		 3.1. Mix design 
		 Four series of LWAC were prepared with aggregates of four different natures: coarse and fine LWA of clay, pumice, and shale, as well as fine NWA. In the following, the two LWAC made of expanded clay are named OC1 and OC2 respectively, the one with expanded shale OS and the one with pumice OP. Composition of all mixtures are presented in Table 3. Portland cement CEM I 52.5 N was used. The concretes were composed of an ordinary cementitious matrix of which the Portland cement content and the water to cement ratio (W/C = 0.45) remained the same for all the mixes. The aggregate was a combination of coarse LWA, fine LWA and normal fine LWA. The fine NWA was a silico-calcareous river sand of size 0/2 mm and density 2460 kg/[m.sup.3]. For each LWAC series, the volumes of fine and coarse aggregates were constant. The only variable was the substitution ratio of the fine NWA by the fine LWA: 0%, 50% and 100% by volume which corresponds to the last number in the mixture names. During this substitution procedure, fine and coarse LWA were always of the same nature. OCT and OC2 concretes were made of the same clay fine LWA, but with different clay coarse LWA 4/10 C and 4/8 C, respectively. For all mixes, the target range for slump was 160 to 200 mm. The superplasticizer amount was adjusted to maintain constant workability. Hence 12 mixes were prepared and tested. 
		 LWA were "saturated" in order to avoid any change of water to cement ratio due to water absorption of aggregates during mixing [1]. The more the LWA is "saturated", the less it absorbs water during mixing. It is thus preferable to immerse LWA for 48 h before mixing in order to avoid any variation of the W/C ratio of LWAC. Moreover, the use of saturated aggregates could provide internal curing to the concrete, which could reduce shrinkage and related cracking and also increase compressive strength due to a more effective cement hydration [27-29], Coarse LWA were immersed for 48 h and then drained about 30 min until their surface moisture content become constant. Mixing water was then reduced by the quantity of water brought by the LWA surface moisture. We suppose that the water absorbed by LWA during immersion was not available for the cement hydration during the mixing. 
		 Cylindrical specimens [empty set]160 x 320 mm were cast for thermal tests. Concrete moulds were removed at 24 h. Specimens were stored in water during 90 days to ensure a complete hydration. The thermal experiments were carried out on "prismatic" samples 140 x 70 x 40 mm cut from [empty set]160 x 320 mm specimens. The samples were polished in order to achieve a good flatness on the 140 x 70 mm surfaces which are in contact with the thermal probe. Twelve "prismatic" samples were prepared for each mixture. The sample conditioning is described in the next subsection. 
		 The cross sections of the concrete without fine LWA are shown in the Fig. 1. The OS and OP concretes have angular aggregate shape while the OC1 and OC2 concretes have rounded aggregate shape. The OC2 concrete which was made with 4/8 clay LWA has smaller particles on the cross section than the OC1 concrete which made with 4/10 clay LWA. 
		 3.2. Sample preparation 
		 With the aim to analyze the influence of moisture content and temperature of concrete on their thermal properties, three sample conditionings were employed. This achieved three different moisture contents in concrete: dry state, saturated state and equilibrium at 50% RH (Table 4). Four "prismatic" samples were used for each moisture content state. 
		 For the dry state, the samples were firstly cured in water for three months. After that, they were dried in an oven at 80[degrees]C until constant weight (variation less than 0.2% after 24 h). Before the thermal tests, the samples were enclosed in a sealed bag which was kept in a climatic chamber at 20[degrees]C for at least 24 h in order to obtain a homogeneous temperature. 
		 For the intermediate state at 50% RH and 20[degrees]C, the samples were also dried in an oven at 80[degrees]C to constant weight after three months immersion. Then they were stored in a climatic chamber at 20[degrees]C and 50% relative humidity until constant moisture content. The constant moisture content state is verified when the mass of the samples does not vary more than 0.02% after 24 h [30] during 5 consecutive days. It took from two to three months for "prismatic" sample to reach the moisture content equilibrium. The higher water-accessible porosity of concrete, the longer time needed to reach equilibrium will be. The results of moisture adsorption at 50% RH ([W.sub.RH50]) and 20[degrees]C of LWAC are compared to their water absorption coefficients in Table 5. 
		 The samples used for saturated state testing were cured in water at 20[degrees]C until the tests. They were dried on surface using a wet rag before the measure. Water absorption coefficients and water accessible porosity of concrete were deduced from concretes densities measured on saturated samples according to the NF EN 12390-7. Water accessible porosity, which is the volume ratio of absorbed water to concrete sample, is given by: 
		 [phi] = [V.sub.water]/[V.sub.Wrete] = ([[rho].sub.d] - [[rho].sub.s])/[[rho].sub.eau] (1) 
		 where [[rho].sub.d] and [[rho].sub.s] are oven-dried density and saturated density of concrete. The water absorption coefficient is given by: 
		 [W.sub.a] = [m.sub.water]/[m.sub.concrete] = [phi] x [[rho].sub.eau]/ [[rho].sub.d] (2) 
		 Furthermore, the thermal properties were measured on dried samples at different temperatures. The tests were conducted at 5[degrees]C, 20[degrees]C, 35[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C. 
		 3.3. Thermal tests 
		 Thermal experiments were conducted on concrete samples using a Hot Disk probe TPS1500 (Fig. 2). The probe was used both as heat source and as temperature sensor. The sensor was sandwiched between two identical 140 x 70 x 40 mm samples of concrete. Each sample must have a flat surface in order to avoid contact defect with the sensor. The sensor consists of a very fine nickel double spiral (10 [micro]m of thickness) covered with two thin layers of electrically-insulating material. A kapton probe of 9.87 mm radius was used for measurement in climatic chamber and a mica probe of 9.72 mm radius for measurement in the furnace. The system is based on Transient Plane Source techniques (TPS). The concrete sample is initially kept at thermal equilibrium. Then a heating pulse is applied by the Hot Disk sensor to create a thermal disturbance on the sample. The thermal resistance of the probe is monitored during the time of measurement. This allows to determine the temperature increase [DELTA]T(t) of the sensor. For the Hot Disk sensor, [DELTA]T(t) is given by the following equation, from which the thermal conductivity X and diffusivity a can be obtained [31]: 
		 [bar.[DELTA]T([tau])] = [P.sub.0]/[[pi].sup.3/2]r[lambda] D([tau]) (3) 
		 where [P.sub.0] is the total output power, [lambda] is the thermal conductivity of the sample, and r is the radius of the sensor. D([tau]) is the theoretical expression of the time dependent temperature increase, which describes the conducting pattern of the Hot Disk sensor, This parameter D([tau]) is function of the thermal diffusivity of the sample [31]. Analysis of the data was performed using the Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyser software. 
		 The thermal conductivity [lambda] and specific heat [c.sub.p] and thermal diffusivity a are related by the following expression: a = [lambda]/[rho][c.sub.p] where [rho] represents the density of the material. 
		 Thermal tests at 5[degrees]C and 20[degrees]C were carried out in the climatic chamber at the corresponding temperature. Once the temperature of the sample was stabilized, this one was installed on the Hot Disk sample holder inside the climatic chamber. After each measure, the probe was moved to another position on sample in order to avoid the influence of heterogeneity in the concrete. For each concrete mix, five tests were performed. The standard deviation of each concrete mix is less than 6% for thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat. 
		 Temperatures at 35[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C were obtained using the Hot Disk furnace (Fig. 3). For these measures, the samples at 20[degrees]C were put in the sample holder in the furnace. The Hot Disk device used The Thermal Constants Analyzer program to control and stabilize the furnace temperature before measurement. For each sample, thermal tests at 35[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C were carried out consecutively. There were therefore two temperature increases of 15[degrees]C and two stabilization stages at 35[degrees]C and at 50[degrees]C. The heating rate was about 0.25[degrees]C/minute which was executed automatically by Hot Disk program. The stability criterion was set at a maximum variation of 0.5[degrees]C for 30 min. Two pairs of samples were prepared for each concrete mix. A total of six measurements were performed at a target temperature for each mix. 
		 The oven dry density and thermal properties of LWAC are shown in Table 6 for measurements at different moisture contents and in Table 7 for measurements at different temperatures. 
		 4. Discussion 
		 The thermal properties of LWAC are discussed in this section. Firstly, we present the moisture adsorption of LWAC at equilibrium at 50% RH and 20[degrees]C. Secondly, the thermal behavior of LWAC at different moisture contents and the influence of mix design parameters are investigated. Finally, the influence of the temperature increasing from 5[degrees]C to 50[degrees]C is discussed. 
		 4.1. Moisture adsorption of lightweight aggregate concrete at 50% RH and 20[degrees]C 
		 Under this curing condition (Table 4), the concretes are in a sorption state. Concrete moisture content increases due to the penetration of moist air and water vapor condensation. In order to analyze the impact of moisture content on the thermal properties of LWAC, water content at 50% RH was calculated comparing to the dry state, in the same way that is calculated the water absorption coefficient. The water content is determined by the ratio of the weight gain to the oven-dry sample weight. 
		 Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the equilibrium moisture content of LWAC according to the fine aggregate substitution rate. The measurements are performed on four samples per formulation. The average relative standard deviation is 3% which shows a low dispersion of the results. At equilibrium state, LWAC with 100% fine NWA have moisture content between 2% and 3% while LWAC with 100% fine LWA have moisture content between 2% to 4%. This value is about 1.5% for concrete with NWA according to [30]. 
		 The OC2-0 and OP-O concretes, which have similar densities (Table 6), have almost identical moisture adsorption (2.5%). In contrast, the moisture adsorption of OS-O concrete (2%) is lower than that of OC1-O concrete (3%) despite their similar densities. The same cementitious matrix (volume, W/C) was used in all concretes, so the difference in concrete porous network is related to that of aggregates. As saturated LWA aggregates are used the effect of aggregate absorption on the hydration water content at the aggregate/cement interfacial zone is minimised so the porosity of the cement matrix would remain the same for all types of concretes. The low moisture of shale LWAC is explained by the low water-absorption coefficient (low percentage of open porosity compared to total porosity) of shale aggregates 4/10 S despite its low density [1]. The moisture adsorption of OC1 clay concrete is the highest, which correspond to the high water-accessible porosity of 4/10 C aggregate. So the adsorbed water content seems clearly linked to the open porosity of aggregate. The substitution of fine NWA by fine LWA leads to change of equilibrium moisture content according to the nature of the fine LWA. The complete substitution of the fine NWA by fine shale LWA (OS), which is the heaviest fine LWA, provides additional moisture content of 0.3%. Following the complete substitution, the increasing of moisture content is between 0.8 and 1.2% for clay concretes (OC1 and OC2) and pumice concrete (OC) (Fig. 4). 
		 The water contents in saturated state and at 50% RH are compared in Fig. 5. The three points of each curve correspond from left to right to the concretes with 0%, 50% and 100% of fine LWA. The comparison shows that the open porosity is not the only factor explaining the different moisture contents of LWAC at 50% RH. The water absorption by immersion is linked to the water transfer of liquid phase into the pores (capillary action, gravity, external pressure) when the sample is immersed. Furthermore, the moisture content at a specific humidity is related to the diffusion of water vapor and its adsorption in the pores. Water vapor condenses to liquid water when the vapor pressure in the pore is high enough. Indeed, the equilibrium condensation--evaporation at a given temperature of water is governed by the pore size according to Kelvin's law and Laplace's law [32,33]. The adsorbed water also depends on the surface forces (Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds ...). Fig. 5 shows a higher slope of the curve of pumice concrete (OP) than that of other concretes. This means the pumice fine aggregate (0/5 P) has a greater hygroscopic character than clay (0/4 C) fine aggregate despite similar water absorption coefficient. The comparison of pore size distribution of both aggregates doesn't show finer pores for the pumice one [1]. But, the pumice aggregate consists of amorphous silica and silicates. These chemical compounds can bind hydroxyl groups -OH (silanols) which are strongly hydrophilic. This higher hydrophilicity could lead to a higher propensity of the vapor-water to be fixed on pore surfaces. 
		 4.2. Thermal properties of lightweight aggregate concretes at different moisture states 
		 4.2.1. Influence of the moisture content on the thermal properties 
		 This section presents the evolution of the thermal conductivity, the specific heat and the thermal diffusivity of LWAC according to their moisture content. Results are presented for the minimum and maximum volume fractions of fine LWA, i.e. LWAC without fine LWA and with 100% fine LWA. The thermal properties of LWAC were investigated for three different conditionings: oven-dried (dry state), at equilibrium at 50% RH (partial saturation state) and immersion (saturated state). 
		 Thermal conductivity of LWAC increases almost linearly with the water content (Fig. 6). At the saturated state, LWAC with 100% fine LWA have equivalent thermal conductivity to oven-dry LWAC without fine LWA. The total substitution of fine aggregate reduces the thermal conductivity of LWAC by 0.22 W/mK on average while the saturation by immersion increases the thermal conductivity of LWAC with 100% fine LWA for 0.33 W/mK on average. From the dry state to the saturated state, there is an increase of 37% -93% of the thermal conductivity depending on the nature and the volume fraction of LWA. For 50% RH conditioning, the increase in thermal conductivity of LWAC ranges between 4% and 19%. In fact, when the moisture content increases in concrete, the "dry" air in the pores is replaced by water and moist air. Thermal conductivity of water (0.601 W/mK at 20[degrees]C) is much greater than that of air (0.026 W/mK at 20[degrees]C) [34,35], Thus the thermal conductivity of LWAC logically increases with the saturation degree. 
		 Similar results were confirmed by other authors on concrete with normal weight aggregates. The linear relation between moisture content and thermal conductivity of lightweight concretes was presented in [14]. Kim et al. [23] have found an increase of 0.33-0.43 kcal/hmC (about 0.43-0.5 W/mK) between the dry state and the saturated state at 20[degrees]C of normal weight concretes (mixes C-GC1 and C-GC2 with W/C of 0.4). Normal weight concretes have lower porosity than LWAC. However, the comparison shows that the normal weight concretes have higher conductivity increase (0.43-0.5 W/mK) due to the saturation than that of LWAC (0.27-0.39 W/mK). This means that the water proportion is not the only factor that influences thermal conductivity increase. As an example the OC1-100 concrete has a water absorption coefficient of 27.1%, equivalent to a water accessible porosity of 31.8%", yet the thermal conductivity increases by 0.39 W/mK which is much higher than the value given by a general rule of mixtures (about 0.17 W/mK). The used LWA have different properties and different pore structure which were investigated in [1,6]. The contribution of low resistance pathway (created by water) doesn't only depend on the volume fraction of the phases but also on their pore structure. Hence, the thermal conduction could be affected by the percolation threshold of the thermal conduction in LWAC. 
		 The evolutions of specific heat of LWAC according to the moisture content are shown in Fig. 7. The specific heat increases with the moisture content. A quasi-linear relationship between these two factors is also observed. Between the dry state and the saturated state, the specific heat increases by 21%-43% depending on the nature and the volume fraction of the aggregates. The increase of specific heat of LWAC at the partial saturation state (50% RH conditioning) is only 5% on average. These evolutions of the specific heat are also linked to the replacement of "dry" air, which have a low specific heat (1005 J/kgK), by water phases, which have higher specific heats (4181.3J/kgK for liquid water and 2080J/ kgK for water vapor). 
		 The thermal diffusivity is the ratio of thermal conductivity to the specific heat and the density. It varies from 0.32 to 0.48 [mm.sup.2]/s for the studied LWAC in the dry state. The variations of thermal conductivity, specific heat and density of LWAC as a function of moisture content have the same linear growing tendency. The increases of these properties are compensated when calculating thermal diffusivity. This leads to a low increase or decrease of the thermal diffusivity of LWAC following the increase of moisture content (Fig. 8). The minor variations of the thermal diffusivity do not exceed 10% (except for concrete OP-100) between the dry state and the saturated state. At the maximum moisture content (obtained by immersion), the variation of thermal diffusivity of LWAC is about 4% on average. As a result, the transient thermal performance of LWAC elements and therefore thermal inertia, which is dominated by concrete thermal diffusivity, is not much affected by the increase of concrete moisture content. However, the steady thermal performance of LWAC, which depends only on concrete thermal conductivity, decreases with the moisture content increasing. 
		 4.2.2. Influence of the nature of coarse aggregates 
		 Figs. 9 and 10 show the relative increase of thermal conductivity of LWAC at saturated state according physical properties of coarse LWA. The error bar shows the mean value [+ or -] standard deviation. For more information about the influence of the coarse LWA nature, the results on concrete mixes with 100% of fine NWA were considered. The OS shale concrete has the lowest increase of thermal conductivity despite the low particle density of 4/10 S aggregate (Fig. 9). This aggregate showed the lowest water accessible porosity of all coarse LWA (Fig. 10). This is related to the pore structure and density of shale aggregate. Experimental investigation in [1,6] shows that 4/10 S aggregate has a high proportion of closed pores, thanks to its thicker dense-outer-shell than that of other coarse LWA. Therefore, this feature diminishes the conductivity rise at saturated state for the OS shale concrete. The increases of conductivity are thus more related to water accessible porosity (Fig. 10) than to grain density (Fig. 9). The OC1 concrete made of 4/10 C clay aggregate has the highest conductivity increase with the moisture content. This is due to the highest water-accessible porosity of the 4/10 C aggregate (Fig. 10). The OP pumice concrete has a similar increase of conductivity as that of OC 2 clay concrete. This can be explained by their similar water-accessible porosities. 
		 4.2.3. Influence of the nature and the proportion of fine lightweight aggregates 
		 The influence of fine aggregate substitution on the thermal conductivity of LWAC at different moisture states can be observed in Figs. 11-13. The concrete density decreases with the fine LWA proportion, leading to a decrease of thermal conductivity of concrete for all three sample conditionings. For dry LWAC, the reduction of conductivity ranges between 20 and 35%. In general, the replacement of fine NWA by fine LWA increases the influence of sample conditioning on the thermal conductivity of LWAC (Figs 12 and 13). Concretes containing more fine LWA are more porous than concrete with fine NWA. They have higher moisture content than LWAC with fine NWA in the same environmental condition. That leads logically to a higher increase of thermal conductivity. At saturated state, the thermal conductivity increases by 45% for LWAC without fine LWA and by 70% for LWAC with 100% of fine LWA (Fig. 13). At equilibrium state at 50% RH, the increases of thermal conductivity are 7% and 11% on LWAC before and after the fine aggregate substitution, respectively (Fig. 12). 
		 The influence of fine LWA nature is examined through histograms in Figs 12 and 13. The error bar shows the mean value [+ or -] standard deviation. It will be recalled that fine and coarse LWA of the same nature are used in each mix. The 0/4 S aggregate has the lowest water absorption coefficient at 8% while these coefficients are about 18% for both clay and pumice fine aggregates (0/4 C and 0/5 P). As expected, the substitution of fine NWA by the 0/4 S shale aggregate induces a low increase of thermal conductivity of OS concrete, either at partial saturation state or at saturated state. With 100% of shale fine LWA, the [lambda]/[[lambda].sup.dry] ratio is about 1.05 at partial saturation state and 1.42 at saturated state (Figs. 12 and 13). These two values are respectively 1.1-1.17 and 1.7-1.9 for others fine LWA. This could be attributed to the low water accessible porosity of fine shale aggregate [1], Furthermore, OP and OC2 concretes have similar increase of thermal conductivity in both partially saturated and saturated states. These two concretes use fine lightweight aggregates of similar density, similar water absorption coefficient, i.e. similar water accessible porosity (Table 3). This confirms the role of aggregate density and water accessible porosity on the thermal conductivity of concrete. 
		 However, the substitution of fine NWA by the same fine LWA (0/2 N by 0/4 C in the clay concretes) leads to a faster conductivity increase in the OC1 for both saturated and 50% RH conditionings (Figs. 12 and 13). The OC1 concrete has indeed a higher increase of water-accessible porosity (8.2%) than that of OC2 concrete (5.6%) following the total substitution of fine aggregate (Table 5). Adding porous fine LWA could more improve the pore interconnection in OC1 concrete than in OC2 concrete. The access to aggregate open pores could be easier for OC1 than for OC2. The thermal conductivity depends not only on the volume of solids/water/air but also on the pore structure of these phases. This may lead to higher thermal conductivity of moisturized LWAC if there is a good pore "connection". Indeed, in presence of water, the contribution of water conductivity and moist air conductivity to the concrete conductivity is higher than that of air to the dry concrete conductivity. Good pore connection favors the heat transfer in water phase by conduction and convection. The higher connected porosity of concrete, the higher influence of "moist" conditioning on the concrete conductivity is. 
		 4.3. Influence of the temperature on the thermal properties of lightweight aggregate concretes 
		 Fig. 14 shows the changes in thermal conductivity of LWAC according to the temperature increase. The thermal conductivity increases from 5[degrees]C to 35[degrees]C than it levels off after 35[degrees]C. In the temperature range from 5[degrees]C to 50[degrees]C, the thermal conductivity of LWAC without fine LWA increases by 0.12-0.15 W/mK (17% to 24%). The rise of conductivity ranges from 0.1 W/mK to 0.14 W/ mK (about 24-30%) for LWAC made of 100% fine LWA. 
		 In LWA, the water-accessible porosity can reach up to 32% [36], There may be also closed pores which contain air and/or trapped water. According to [34], the thermal conductivity of the dry air increases almost linearly from 0.0245 to 0.028 W/mK (about 14%) for temperature ranging from 5[degrees]C to 50[degrees]C. The air conductivity contribution is negligible in the rise of concrete thermal conductivity. Another factor that may influence the increase in thermal conductivity is the presence of trapped water in the pores. The physically bound water is not all removed after drying in oven at 80[degrees]C. In the temperature range between 5[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C, the thermal conductivity of water increases from 0.5715 W/mK to 0.6445 W/mK (about 13%) according to [35]. The higher conductivity increase of LWAC with 100% fine LWA highlights the part taken by trapped water on the relationship between LWAC conductivity and temperature. However, the low increase of water conductivity with temperature doesn't fully explain the rise of LWAC thermal conductivity. Some other researches have mentioned the radiation contribution to the thermal conductivity of materials [37-39]. The modeling of radiation conductivity by Ochs [38] showed a slight increase of thermal conductivity with temperature in expanded clay and expanded glass aggregates. Ochs pointed out an increase of 0.2 W/mK of all studied expanded clay aggregates following a temperature rising from 20[degrees]C to 80[degrees]C. According to [40] the contribution of radiation on thermal conductivity is not negligible for materials with a high porosity and a pore size superior to 100 um. However, the increase of conductivity due to radiation and highlighted by Och [38] can't explain all of the increase in conductivity of concretes between 5 and 35[degrees]C. The thermal expansion may also reduce the pore sizes and contribute to the increase in thermal conductivity. 
		 The stabilization of thermal conductivity between 35[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C may be explained by the loss of conductive bonds in concrete. This could be linked to the departure of physically and chemically bound water [21]. The occurrence of microcracks at the interfacial transition zone could also contribute to the stabilization of the conductivity at that temperature range. These microcracks could be generated by the differential thermal expansion and the occurrence of stresses at the paste-aggregate interface. This porosity increase compensates for the increasing trend of thermal conductivity rise with temperature. 
		 The specific heat of LWAC decreases from 5[degrees]C to 20[degrees]C (Fig. 15). Then there is an increase of this thermal property when the temperature rises up to 50[degrees]C. The increase rate is from 6% to 10% for shale and pumice concretes and from 10% to 14% for clay concrete (except the OC1-100). The variation of the specific heat as a function of temperature is significant for LWAC. The dependence of the specific heat on temperature has been noticed in [25,26] for the cement pastes and normal weight concretes. The rise of specific heat with temperature increase is due to the specific heat evolutions of the mineral phases in concrete. XDR analysis on the same LWA has shown that expanded shale and expanded clay aggregate contain a lot of mineral phases while pumice aggregate contain almost amorphous silica [1,36]. These aggregate have from 60 to 72% of quartz in their composition (Table 2). According to several authors [41-43], the specific heat of minerals is a thermodynamic parameter varying as a function of temperature. Hemingway [41] has presented in his work an increase of specific heat of quartz by 20% while temperature rises from 298[degrees]K to 400[degrees]K. Bruckner [42] has shown that between 300[degrees]K and 500[degrees]K, the specific heat of vitreous silica increase about 30%. Otherwise, the specific heat of other minerals such as hematite, magnetite and plagioclase increases between 16% and 18% in the temperature range from 298[degrees]K to 400[degrees]K [43]. These are mineral phases that have been observed in the expanded shale and expanded clay aggregates [1,36]. 
		 The high values of LWAC specific heat at 5[degrees]C could be explained by the presence of water vapor in the pores. Indeed, trapped water in concrete may exist in liquid-vapor equilibrium. During the sample conditioning at 5[degrees]C, the temperature could fall below the dew point, leading to an excess of water condensation. Therefore, the amount of condensed water on the pore walls would be greater at 5[degrees]C than that between 20[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C. Since the specific heat of liquid water (4185 J/kgK) is more than 2 times greater than that of water vapor (2026 J/kgK) and that of dry air (1012 J/kgK) [44], specific heat of concrete increases with the temperature decrease from 20[degrees]C down to 5[degrees]C. 
		 The thermal diffusivity evolution results from those of thermal conductivity and the heat capacity (Fig. 16). LWAC diffusivity increases by 11-38% according to temperature increase from 5[degrees]C to 35[degrees]C. The diffusivity decreases slightly from 35[degrees]C to 50[degrees]C. This is related to the conductivity stabilization and the specific heat increase in this temperature range. 
		 5. Conclusion 
		 In this study, the thermal properties of LWAC at several moisture contents and ambient temperatures were investigated. Twelve mixtures of LWAC made of LWA from three different natures were tested. The densities of the studied LWAC are between 1170 kg/m3 and 1520 kg/m3 At the dry state, LWAC have a thermal conductivity varying from 0.43 to 0.73 W/mK, a specific heat varying from 1000 to 1100 J/kgK and a thermal diffusivity ranging from 0.32 to 0.48 mm2/s. The study shows a non-negligible dependence of LWAC thermal properties on the moisture content and on the temperature. Relationships between thermal properties and environmental conditions are influenced by the volume fraction, the density and the pore structure of the aggregates. 
		 There is a quasi-linear increase of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of LWAC with the moisture content in mass The increase ranges from 1,8 [10.sup.-2]W/mK to 2.1 [10.sup.-2] W/mK per mass % of water for concretes with lightweight coarse aggregates and normal weight fine aggregates and is about 1,5 [10.sup.-2] W/mK per mass% of water for concretes with fines and coarse lightweight aggregates. At the saturation state, the thermal conductivity increase is 60% in average. At the equilibrium state of 50% RH, the thermal conductivity increases by 9% in average with a moisture content ranging from 2.1 to 4.2%. Increasing of the moisture content leads to an increase of the LWAC specific heat by 30% in average at saturated state and by 5% in average at the intermediate state of 50% RH. The increase of the moisture content results in a low variation (4% in average) of the thermal diffusivity for all studied mixes. 
		 The dependence of LWAC thermal properties on moisture content is due to the replacement of the air phase by a water phase in the concrete pores. The water-accessible porosity of LWA is the key parameter which influences the increase of LWAC thermal conductivity with the moisture content. Aggregates pore structure within the concrete could generate different "interconnections" in the microstructure, which could have an impact on the thermal conductivity of LWAC. 
		 The evolutions of the thermal properties as a function of the temperature are not linear in the studied range 5[degrees]C-50[degrees]C. The temperature has a slightly adverse effect on the thermal behavior of LWAC. In the range 20[degrees]C-50[degrees]C, the thermal conductivity increases with the temperature, and then stabilizes around a mean value after 35[degrees]C. The thermal conductivity increases by 17% to 30% depending on the mineralogical composition of the aggregates. The specific heat of LWAC decreases with the temperature in the range 5[degrees]C-20[degrees]C, and then increases from 5 to 20% in the range 20[degrees]C50 [degrees]C depending on mineralogical aggregate composition. The effect of temperature in building isolation purpose must take into account the evolution of theses thermal properties. 
		 HIGHLIGHTS 
		 * Twelve mixtures of LWAC made of LWA from three different natures were tested. 
		 * Thermal properties of LWAC were measured at different temperatures and moisture content. 
		 * The conductivity increases between 5[degrees]C and 35[degrees]C and then stabilizes between 35[degrees]C and 50[degrees]C. 
		 * The thermal conductivity and specific heat of LWAC increase linearly with the moisture content. 
		 * The increase of the moisture content results in a low variation (4%) of the thermal diffusivity.

<titre>Influence of different surface treatments on the water absorption capacity of flax fibres: Rheology of fresh reinforced-mortars and mechanical properties in the hardened state.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.12.042 
		 ABSTRACT 
		 An experimental investigation was undertaken on the influence of different surface treatments of flax fibres on mortar properties in both fresh and hardened states. Three types of coating were explored for surface modification: atmospheric-pressure plasma, mineral coating made of a grout of cement and ground granulated blast-furnace slag, and polymer coating based on linseed oil. Water absorption tests were performed to evaluate the performance of the coatings. Water absorption kinetics and/or water retention capacity were drastically modified by the plasma treatment at atmospheric-pressure and by the linseed oil treatment. The workability of the pastes incorporating fibres coated with the cement grout or linseed oil was greatly improved compared to the raw fibres. The presence of fibres significantly increases the rate of entrapped air, which seems to depend on the nature of the coating. In the hardened state, regardless of the nature of the fibre coating, the flexural strength increases beyond 90 days of curing. Up to 320 days of curing, the compressive strengths of the different composites are similar to that of the control mortar, except for the composite with linseed oil coated-fibres which proves to be the most porous. The presence of flax fibres also enhances the mortar toughness and prevent from desiccation cracking. Nevertheless, none of the treatments experimented in this work makes it possible to preserve the beneficial effects of fibres on the mechanical behaviour of composites in the long term.
		Keywords: 
		 Flax fibre 
		 Cementitious composite 
		 Surface treatment 
		 Workability 
		 Mechanical properties 
		 Toughness 
		 1. Introduction 
		 The main benefit expected from the reinforcement of a cement matrix by fibres is to avoid the formation of desiccation cracks that can lead to catastrophic failure. The composite can then exhibit a post-peak controlled cracking which is often described as "ductile behaviour" and which results from various damage mechanisms such as the formation of microcracks in the matrix and their bridging by the fibres, fibres debonding, break and subsequent friction with the matrix [1-4]. The most commonly used reinforcements in cementitious composites are steel fibres, glass fibres and polypropylene fibres [1,5]. However, during the last decades, concerns about the end of life of materials and sustainable development have focused attention on bio-based products [6]. Since then, numerous studies have shown that plant fibres can be substituted for glass or steel fibres in certain applications [7-9]. 
		 Several previous works relating to the incorporation of flax fibres into mortars and concretes have pointed out a significant impact on the properties in the fresh state and in the hardened State. It was highlighted that in fresh state, natural fibres affect the rheology of the paste [10-12]. Indeed, the consistence decreases with the increase in fibres content. The tendency of fibres to agglomerate also increases when their content in the composite increases [13]. In the literature, these rheological disturbances are mainly attributed to the high demand for water due to the high-water absorption capacity of flax fibres (up to 150% of dry fibre mass) [14,15]. Thus, the amount of water recommended by standards for the manufacture of concrete [16] will be insufficient to ensure good workability of the cement paste with fibres, even correct cement hydration. In hardened state, composites reinforced with plant fibres present an improvement of the flexural toughness or strength and an increased ductility. The transition from a brittle matrix to a ductile fibre-reinforced composite having a controlled post-peak behaviour is noted by several authors [17]. Many authors highlight an increased porosity in the composite which acts to depress the compressive strength [15,18]. However, studies have shown that the hydrophilicity of the plant fibres causes volume variations, which leads to poor fibre/matrix interface [19,20]. 
		 Water absorption by plant fibres is therefore an important issue limiting their use in composite materials. Surface treatment may be a solution to limit or eliminate the water absorption by these fibres. Thus, this work focuses on the changes in the rheological, physical and mechanical properties of mortars reinforced with surface-treated flax fibres. The first treatment evaluated in this study is the atmospheric-pressure plasma technique. Previous studies have reported improvements of certain functional properties of lignocellulosic fibres due to cold plasma treatment, such as flame retardant or hydrophobic properties [21]. The second treatment proposed is linseed oil coating. It has already been studied by several authors for sunflower aggregates [22] or beet pulp [23] and showed a significant decrease in water absorption capacity. The third treatment is a mineral coating based on cement and ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). Other authors have tested a cement-grout coating [23,24]. 
		 2. Materials 
		 2.1. Raw materials 
		 A CEM I 52.5 N white Portland cement in accordance with EN 196-1 standard was used [25]. This cement, with Blaine fineness of 4250 [cm.sup.2] x [g.sup.-1], presents a compressive strength on standardized mortar at 28 days of 71 MPa. 
		 It has been shown in previous studies that the use of a superplasticizer can limit the loss of workability when adding flax fibres into mortars [26]. For this purpose, a high range water reducer superplasticizer based on polycarboxylates and compatible with CEM I 52.5 N cement was added at a ratio of 1.0% relative to the mass of cement (i.e. 0.30% solids) to provide a better workability in the fresh state. 
		 Moreover, it was highlighted that the use of a viscosity-modifying agent (VMA) with bio-based composites allows to limit the migration of water towards plant aggregates [27]. Thus, a VMA based on a high-molecular weight bio-polymer was added to the mortars at a ratio of 0.50% relative to the mass of cement (i.e. 0.03% solids) to avoid the segregation phenomenon. 
		 An alluvial sand with grain size between 0 and 4 mm was used. This sand with a density of 2.66, an absorption coefficient of 0.30% and a fineness modulus of 2.10 was also in accordance with the French standard NF P 18-545 [28]. 
		 Aramis variety of flax fibres harvested in Normandy (France) in 2014 were cut at a constant length of 12 mm and provided by Vandecandelaere Company (Depestele Group) specialized in flax farming and scutching (Fig. 1). These fibres exhibit a good productivity--strength compromise and represent an important part of French flax production [29]. At room temperature the raw flax fibres (referenced RF) with moisture content of about 7.63 [+ or -] 0.10% have a density of 1.52. Their physical and mechanical properties are given in Table 1. 
		 2.2. Flax fibre treatments 
		 2.2.1. Atmospheric-pressure plasma surface treatment 
		 The atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment is used in various industrial field; to modify the surface properties of many materials such as textiles, plant fibres metals, polymers or composites [30-32]. A surface modification technique comparable to that of atmospheric plasma is the physical layer deposition [33]. It is minimally invasive because the penetration depth into the material is only a few micrometres. 
		 The source used for the coating is injected into the plasma flame (ionized gas) using a carrier gas. This gas mixture is projected at high speed and high energy on the surface of the body to be treated. The coating thickness typically ranges from a few nanometres to a few micrometres [34]. The Openair[R] Plasma technology was carried out in partnership with the CREPIM laboratory (France). In this work the plasma was ionized nitrogen and the source was Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO). The purpose of HMDSO coating is to lower the surface tension of the fibres, in order to reduce their hydrophilic character [21]. The fibres obtained are abbreviated APF for Atmospheric Plasma Fibres. 
		 2.2.2. Slag-cement coating treatment 
		 This treatment consists of coating the flax fibres with a thin grout of hydraulic binders. Its role is to provide chemical fibre insulation by reducing exchanges with the matrix and decreasing the water absorption. The choice of the composition of the grout also takes into account the persistence of a good adhesion of the coating to the surface of the fibres in an alkaline environment. The binder grout used for the treatment is composed of 50% by volume of ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and 50% of ordinary Portland cement CEM I (OPC). These rates are explained by the following considerations: low GGBS rate does not allow for sufficiently significant impact while too high rate prevents the proper hydration of the grout since the GGBS needs cement for its hydration. Other authors have tested 100% cement-based coating [23,24]. Nevertheless, the embedded plant fibres were finally degraded over time due to the very high alkalinity of the coating. The partial replacement of cement with GGBS is expected to decrease the degradation of the fibres. In addition, GGBS has an environmental impact much lower than the cement. This grout was prepared with water/binder mass ratio of 1 and fibre/binder ratio of These ratios correspond to those used in a previous study [24]. The fibres thus obtained are abbreviated SCF for Slag-Cement Fibres. 
		 2.2.3. Linseed oil coating treatment 
		 Linseed oil is a viscous liquid that hardens by oxidation on contact with air to form a solid film. This reactivity to air explains its common use as surface coating for waterproofing in wood industry. This treatment has already been experimented to enhance the compatibility between cement and lignocellulosic particles [22,23]. A linseed oil/fibre mass ratio of 0.25 was used for the treatment. To implement this treatment, the fibres were first dried at 50 [+ or -] 0.1[degrees]C for 24 h and mixed with the linseed oil in a planetary mixer. The treated fibres are then placed in a ventilated oven at 50 [+ or -] 0.1[degrees]C for 14 days. The fibres thus obtained are abbreviated LOF for Linseed Oil Fibres. 
		 2.3. Mix-design 
		 The respective proportions of the mortar constituents are detailed in Table 2. The effective water on cement ratio ([W.sub.eff]/C) was set at 0.51. An additional amount of water was added to consider the water absorption of aggregates and flax fibres. The amount of flax fibres was set at 1.0 vol.% relative to the total batch volume. 
		 After mixing, the mortars were cast in two layers into prismatic molds (40 x 40 x 160 mm) in accordance with EN 196-1 [25]. To expel the air from the mixture, the molds were subjected to 60 hits on a vibrating table before adding the second layer. The test pieces were demolded 24 h after manufacturing, and then were placed under hydrothermal control at 20 [+ or -] 1[degrees]C and 90%RH. 
		 3. Experimental methods 
		 3.1. Flax fibres physical properties 
		 The measurement of flax fibre real density was conducted using a helium pycnometer, on a oven-dried fibres sample of about 1.0 g; six samples have been tested. The mechanical tests were performed on 50 samples of elementary fibres, using the protocol described in the French standard NFT25-501-2 [35]. The tests were performed on Instron 5566-type universal testing apparatus equipped with a 10N capacity load cell, at a crosshead displacement rate of 1 mm x [min.sup.-1] and using a gauge length of 10 mm. The diameter of flax fibres was measured using an optical microscope in six different points distributed over the gauge length, on 103 samples, according to T25-501-1 standard [36]. 
		 Because of their chemical composition (cellulose and hemicelluloses, mainly), and the presence of the lumen and eventual defects through the walls, flax fibres are very sensitive to water [37]. Their water absorption kinetics were investigated according to a specific protocol. Firstly, the fibres were dried at 60 + 0.1[degrees]C in a ventilated oven for 48 h. Then 3.00 g of fibres were placed into a micro perforated plastic bag which was immersed for different immersion times (1 min-48 h) in a container filled with distilled water. The bags were then placed in a centrifuge operating at 500 rpm for 30 s to remove the excess water from the surface of the fibres. The water absorption capacity of these fibres was determined gravimetrically using the Eq. (1). This testing method is derived from the recommendations of the RILEM Technical Committee 236 [38,39]. The experiment has been repeated six times. The water absorption ratio WA(t) at time - is expressed by: 
		 WA(t) m(t) - [m.sub.0]/[m.sub.0] x 100 
		 where m(t) is the soaked fibres mass at time t, and [m.sub.0] the initial dry mass. W[A.sub.24] corresponds to the water absorption ratio after 24 h of immersion. 
		 3.2. Fresh properties of mortars 
		 The fresh state density has been determined by measuring the mass and volume of samples filled in a vibrated metallic cylinder (EN 12350-6) [40]. The air content of fresh mortar was calculated from the relative difference of the mortar theoretical density and the experimental fresh density. 
		 The consistency measurements of the mortars are assessed by implementing two types of test. The first type of test consists in measuring the flow time using a testing device recommended by the French standard NF PI8-452 [41]. This test is used to estimate the dynamic workability of mortars. The apparatus has a compartment divided into two unequal volumes by a removable wall. The time necessary for the mortar to flow from the large compartment into the small one under the influence of the imposed vibration is measured. The second method uses the flow table test according to the EN 1015-3 standard [42]. The flow value is estimated by the average of the measurements of the spread mortar diameter in two perpendicular directions. 
		 3.3. Physical and mechanical properties of hardened mortars 
		 3.3.1. Water accessible porosity 
		 The water accessible porosity (WAP) of the hardened mortar specimens was calculated through vacuum saturation and with a hydrostatic balance according to the NF PI 8-459 standard at 28 days curing [43]. For each mix, four specimens were tested. The 'saturated surface dry' state of the specimens was obtained through vacuum saturation. Initially, the specimens were placed in a vacuum chamber in presence of silica gel in order to decrease the contact angle of the water of the pores and dry the specimens. After 4 h the water was introduced in the chamber so as the specimens got immersed and the vacuum was kept during additional 44 h. The WAP was obtained from the mass of the 'saturated surface dry' specimens measured in air ([m.sub.air]) and in water ([m.sub.water]), and oven-dried at 50[degrees]C ([m.sub.dry]), using Eq. (2). 
		 WAP = [m.sub.air] - [m.sub.dry]/[m.sub.air] x [m.sub.water] 100 (2) 
		 3.3.2. Compressive and 3-point bending test 
		 The mechanical properties of the mortars were determined by compressive and three-point bending tests in accordance with the EN 196-1 standard [25]. The compression test was implemented at a loading rate of 40 [Nx[min.sup.-1]. In order to highlight the post-peak behaviour of fibre-reinforced mortars, displacement-controlled 3-point bending tests were run at a rate of 0.30 mm x [min.sup.-1]. 
		 3.3.3. Dynamic modulus of elasticity 
		 The dynamic modulus of elasticity has been estimated by the acoustic method based on the measurement of longitudinal ultrasonic waves velocities ([V.sub.L]) through the material, according to EN 12504-4 standard [44]. The time for the ultrasonic waves to propagate through the sample is measured using two piezoelectric sensors (a transmitter and a receiver) in contact with the sample at both ends. Then, this velocity can be related to the dynamic elastic modulus ([E.sub.dyn]) of the material by using Eq. (3). 
		 [E.sub.dyn] = [rho]d x [V.sub.p] x (1 + v) (1 - 2v)/(1 - v) 
		 where [[rho].sub.d] corresponds to the dry specific gravity of the material and V is the Poisson's ratio. In our case, the Poisson's ratio was fixed at 0.25 by following results obtained on mortars [45]. 
		 3.3.4. Fracture toughness 
		 There are several methods for characterising the post-peak behaviour in terms of resistance to crack propagation. In the case of cementitious materials, the most common method is that of the toughness index recommended by ASTM CI 018. The method consists in evaluating the rate of rupture energy since the appearance of the first matrix crack (for a critical displacement D on the loading curve) up to a recommended displacement: 3D for the index [I.sub.5]; 5.5D for the [I.sub.10] index; 15.5D for the [I.sub.30] index. Thus, by definition [I.sub.1] = 1. In practice, the mechanical energy is determined by the area under the loading curve and the vertical axes passing through the abscissae D, 3D, 5.5D, etc. 
		 4. Results and discussion 
		 4.1. Flax fibre characterisation 
		 4.1.1. Microscopic observations 
		 Pictures of raw and treated fibres were taken using digital video microscope for qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatments (Fig. 1). Compared with the raw fibres (RF), a slight deposit is present on the atmospheric plasma-treated fibres (APF). By carrying out energy-dispersive X-ray analyses (EDX), some authors have confirmed the presence of a mineral deposit (presence of silicon-containing compounds) on the atmospheric plasma-treated fibres [21]. The granular structure of the slag cement deposit on the surface of the fibres introduces some roughness which could contribute to improve the adhesion with the cement matrix. Moreover, the deposit tends to encapsulate the fibres within the bundles together, which could complicate their distribution within the matrix during mixing process. For LOF reinforcement, the polymer film formed by the deposition of linseed oil gives a glossy appearance and seems to coat all the fibres within the bundles. This will therefore cause a decrease in the specific surface area of the fibres and limit their separation into single fibres. 
		 4.1.2. Fibres real density 
		 The measurement of the real density of raw and treated fibres is necessary for the mix-design of composites in order to keep a constant volume of fibres whatever the applied treatment. The results of density measurement by gas pycnometer are summarized in Table 3. 
		 It first appears that the atmospheric plasma treatment (APF) slightly increases the density of the fibres by about 0.9%. This increase comes from the mineral deposit on the fibres from HMDSO precursor. The slag-cement coated fibres (SCF) present a density of 1.850, which is about 21% higher than the raw flax fibres (RF). It is also noted that the measured density is very close to the value calculated from the rule of mixtures. Finally, the linseed oil treatment (LOF) results in a measured density similar to the estimated one, but lower than the raw fibre (linseed oil density is 0.93). 
		 4.1.3. Water absorption 
		 The water absorption kinetics of raw and treated flax fibres are presented in Fig. 2. For all of the tested fibres, it is possible to distinguish two water absorption stages. A rapid increase in sample mass is noticed during the first minutes of immersion. In less than 5 min, raw flax fibres absorb more than 50% of their maximum water absorption capacity. Then a slower and continuous absorption stage occurs after 60 min of immersion. Many characteristics of plant fibres, including physical and mechanical properties, are affected by water content [46]. This essentia] factor also induces a competition on the water demand between the flax fibres and the binder, which starts in the mixing stage. Thus, raw flax fibres can absorb up to 130% of their dry mass, i.e. 136,8 [+ or -] 8,6% after 24 h of immersion (Fig. 2). Like all lignocellulosic materials, flax fibres have a strongly hydrophilic character, provided by their free hydroxyl bonds. This water absorption depends on many parameters such as the surface of the fibres (barrier to water diffusion) [47], the chemical composition of the fibre (modified by the retting state) [48,49], the defibration process that can alter the pectins content and thus influence the moisture content of the fibres [50]. 
		 The high porosity and the internal structure of these fibres also intervene in this high water absorption capacity [22]. 
		 As can be seen in Fig. 2, the applied treatments can affect the water intake in different ways: the kinetics of water absorption and the water intake at saturation. Assuming that the nature of the coating does not affect the saturation fibre water content, only the hydration kinetics should be considered. It is important to emphasize that the absorption curves of the treated fibres presented in Fig. 2 take into account the amount of treatment product present on the fibres. Compared to the raw fibres (RF), the slag-cement coating treatment (SCF) reduces the absorption rate by 3% after 24 h of immersion. This value is very low compared to the one reported in a previous study for a mineral coating (cement only), but the amount of treatment product present on the fibres was not considered [24], In applying this correction, it appears that cement coating does not reduce the water absorption of the flax fibres. The high porosity of the hardened slag cement grout can explain this inefficiency. Indeed, the porosity of cementitious binders is usually between 12% and 20%, which is still large enough to allow the diffusion of water through the coating [51], Regarding the linseed oil coating treatment (LOF), a water absorption rate of 103.0 [+ or -] 7.1% was measured after 24 h in immersion (WA24), i.e. about 22% lower than RF. Other authors have also noticed a significant decrease in the hydrophilicity of flax shives and flax fibres coated with linseed oil [23,52]. It should be noted that the absorption kinetics of SCF and LOF seem similar to that of the raw fibres (RF). However, atmospheric plasma treated-fibres (APF) appear to have totally different absorption kinetics. In the first minutes in immersion, the mass increase of APF is lower than with the other treated fibres. However, the water absorption does not appear to stabilize after 60 min, like with other treatments. Fig. 2 clearly shows a quasi-steady absorption rate for RF, SCF and LOF after 60 min in immersion while water absorption rate remains very high beyond 24 h in immersion for APF. Thus, after 24 h of immersion the water absorption rate is 93.1 [+ or -] 10.4%. A previous study on the treatment of flax tows by atmospheric-pressure plasma also showed a significant decrease in water absorption rate determined by the Cobb test (NF EN ISO 535) [21]. Therefore, the atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment seems to slow down the water absorption kinetics in the short term but not the maximum water retention capability. 
		 Fig. 3 which shows the water absorption as a function of immersion time (semi-logarithmic plot), makes it possible to evaluate the impact of the various treatments. First it can be noticed that the water absorption of RF, SCF and LOF versus log(t) are consistent with the relationship previously established by the RILEM Technical Committee 236 [53] until saturation (Eq. (4)). On the other hand, the coefficients of the linear law are significantly different when comparing RF, SCF and LOF. 
		 WA(t) = [C.sub.A]. log (t) + W[A.sub.0] (4) 
		 where W[A.sub.0] is the water absorption rate in the first moments (1 min) of water contact with the surface of the fibre (adsorption mechanisms alone would be activated) and [C.sub.A] the water absorption coefficient (Table 4). 
		 The inter comparisons of the parameters [C.sub.A] and W[A.sub.0] confirm the similarity of the W[A.sub.0] values for RF and SCF, but the absorption coefficient is a little lower for SCF. However, compared to RF and SCF, LOF has a low W[A.sub.0] value which we attribute to a partial obstruction effect of the water infiltration pathways in the fibres, due to the presence of the hydrophobic film produced by the linseed oil. This obstruction effect is also inferred for APF, but this time it is explained by the modification of the surface energy of the fibres by plasma deposition [21]. The power law trend exhibited by the water absorption curve of APF suggests the occurrence of complex time-dependent mechanisms. 
		 4.2. Fresh state mortar properties 
		 4.2.1. Workability 
		 Fig. 4 shows the slump flow, relative to the initial diameter of the test cone (10 cm), measured on different mortars. As to the control mortar (CM), which does not contain fibres, the average relative flow is 175 [+ or -] 8%. This value is somewhat high because of the use of a superplasticizer in the formulation of the mortar. The incorporation of 1.0 vol.% of raw flax fibres has a considerable impact on the mortar flow (RF-M). The relative flow measured after vibration is only 14 + 1%, which corresponds to a very firm consistency. It can also be noticed that the treatment by atmospheric pressure plasma did not improve the mortar workability (AFP-M) relative to RF: the measured relative flow of 13 [+ or -] 1%, is similar to RF-M. However, Fig. 2 showed that this treatment significantly reduces the water absorption of flax fibres at the very beginning of immersion (60 min as it is the case for the flow test). One would have expected a significant improvement in fluidity due to this treatment, but it is not. This means that water absorption by the fibres does not play a major role in the rheology of the paste. Slag-cement and linseed oil coatings have significantly improved the workability of the fresh mortar (SCF-M and LOF-M) although much less than atmospheric plasma treatment: 69 [+ or -] 14% and 61 [+ or -] 13%, respectively. These two treatments have the effect of increasing the apparent cross-section area of the fibrous reinforcement, and therefore their specific surface area is reduced. In doing so, the demand for cement paste to meet the workability criteria is greatly reduced. 
		 The same trends are observed with the device that measures the flow time (Fig. 5). The CM mortar has a very fluid consistency, with flow time of less than 2 s. The RF-M mortar has poor workability, with flow time greater than 20 s, which corresponds to a very firm consistency. A flow time of about 17 s was measured on the AFP-M mortar, which is lower than RF-M, but still remains very high. Finally, mortars incorporating slag-cement or linseed-treated flax fibres (SCF-M and LOF-M) showed similar flow times (about 5 s), which reflects a significant improvement in workability. 
		 4.2.2. Air content 
		 The estimated entrapped air contents, determined from experimental measurements of fresh mortar densities, are presented in Fig. 6. The air content of the reference mortar (CM) is 1.81 [+ or -] 0.63%. This entrapped air content is relatively low for a mortar, the usual values are between 3% and 5% [54]. This low content is due to the fluidizing action of the superplasticizer. Which increases the compactness of the mortar and thereby reduces the air content. The incorporation of flax fibres into mortar has the effect of significantly increasing the air content of the mixture (Fig. 6). The air content of fresh RF-M is 5.95 + 0.81%, which is almost three times higher than the control mortar. As for workability, the atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment does not appear to have a significant influence on entrapped air. Indeed, the fresh APFM mortar has an air content of 5.54 [+ or -] 0.80%, which is very close to RF-M. The treatment with hydraulic binders results in air content of 4.92 [+ or -] 0.54% for fresh SCF-M while with the linseed oil treatment (LOF-M), the air content is much higher (6.99 [+ or -] 0.82%). Flax fibres therefore have a very significant influence on the air content. This great effect of the nature of the fibre coating on the occluded air content of the paste has also been reported in a recent study [15]. Flax fibres may oppose the movement of air towards the free surface of the mixture, which reduces the effectiveness of the shocks applied to evacuate them [55]. 
		 It can be assumed that the increase in the occluded air content due to the presence of the fibres is to the detriment of the cement content in the mixture and this may affect the strength of the hardened mortar. It is therefore relevant to recalculate the volume contents of the constituents by taking into account the entrapped air content. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, the volume content of cement decreased from 164 L x [m.sup.-3] for CM to 155 L x [m.sup.-3] for LOFM i.e a reduction of 5.5% in the volume content of cement, which is not negligible. 
		 4.3. Properties of hardened mortars 
		 4.3.1. Water accessible porosity 
		 As can be seen in Fig. 8, the addition of flax fibres significantly increases the porosity of mortar as it was reported for raw-flax-fibre-reinforced concrete [15]. The porosity raises from 13.8 [+ or -] 0.3%, for the control mortar (CM) up to 18.5 [+ or -] 0,4% for SCFM and 20.8 [+ or -] 0.2% for LOF-M. It is interesting to note that the incorporation of the linseed oil treated fibres increases the entrapped air content with respect to the raw fibre, whereas with hydraulic binders this content is decreased. This could be a consequence of the type of particular interactions generated between an air bubble and the fibre coating. Moreover, the linear relationship between the water accessible porosity and the entrapped air content means that the rate of open porosity in the composite is mainly governed by the air content. 
		 4.3.2. Flexural behaviour 
		 The mechanical properties of a fibre-reinforced composite depend mainly on the fibre content, their orientation, but also the load transfer capability of the fibre-matrix interface [1,56]. Different phenomena acting simultaneously at different degrees, such as the physical and chemical adhesions between the matrix and fibres at this interface govern this load transfer capability [57]. 
		 Regarding to the flexural behaviour of the mortars, Fig. 9 shows the load-load point displacement curve of the control mortar (CM) and reinforced-mortar with 1.0 vol.% of flax fibres (raw or treated) specimens. After 28 days of cure all fibre-reinforced materials show the same stiffness while the control mortar CM is somewhat stiffen Overall, two types of load-displacement are observed. The CM specimen exhibits a totally brittle behaviour. The fibre-reinforced mortar specimens behave linear-elastic until a first load drop associated with the first matrix cracking. The fibres close to the crack tip and lying perpendicular to the plane of the matrix crack are then subject to overload. The high tensile strength of the fibres then makes it possible to increase the applied load. The resulting nonlinear behaviour of the loading curve continues until the maximum load. The post-peak behaviour characterized by a gradual decay of the load while the deformation increases (softening) corresponds to the progressive fracture of the fibres and their friction against the matrix, matrix microcracking, etc. The association of flax fibres with cementitious matrices helps to avoid brittle fracture and can even induce a pseudo ductile behaviour. It was noticed that after 28 days of cure (Fig. 9a), the first matrix cracking always occur for the same displacement whatever the fibre content Indeed, for this displacement the stress intensity factor reaches a critical value which is a characteristic of the brittle matrix (its toughness). Load recovery after the first matrix cracking is observed for RF-M and APF-M, which indicates a minimum fibrematrix bond exists after 28 days of cure. On the other hand, it could be concluded to a weak fibre-matrix interface in the case of the materials SCF-M and LOF-M for which there is no load recovery after the first matrix cracking. After 90 days of curing, all materials exhibit the same stiffness and the post-peak pseudo ductile behaviour is greatly reduced (Fig. 9b). The classification of materials in terms of the maximum load is changed compared to that recorded at 28 days of cure. These observations reveal that important physico-chemical modifications occur in the fibres and in the fibre-matrix interface zone during the cure. These modifications certainly depend on the nature of the fibre coating. 
		 Indeed, some authors have reported the mineralisation of the fibres by calcification processes sometimes observed from 28 days of curing [19,58]. Fibre mineralisation process could continue over time and thus create an increasingly strong bond between the fibres and the cement matrix (strengthening effect of the fibre-matrix interface inducing embrittlement). After 90 days of curing, the strengths of the fibre-reinforced mortars are all higher than the reference mortar (CM), which indicates a contribution of fibres still present. However, they no longer allow maintaining the flexural ductile behaviour but only increasing somewhat the maximum flexural stress. 
		 In Fig. 10 are presented the maximum flexural strength of mortars after 7, 28, 90 and 320 days of curing. First of all, a coherent development of the CM strength versus curing time is noticed. For curing times of 7,28 and 90 days the flexural strengths increase for all formulations, and those with fibres are higher. For these curing times, the differences in resistance between reinforced-mortars are low. For all the curing times the strengths of RF-M and AFP-M mortars are almost similar: the atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment does not seem to have any influence on the flexural strength of mortar. This result is consistent with previous observations which mentioned this treatment does not reduce the water absorption of flax fibres in the long term, but only in the short term (less than 60 min). SCF-M strengths are lower than RF-M at 7 and 28 days of cure but higher after 90 days. This could be due to the pozzolanic reaction of ground-granulated blast furnace slag which is known to induce a lower resistance than that of Portland cement in short cure times (less than 28 days), but higher after 90 days [59], Mortars incorporating linseed-oil treated fibres (LOF-M) have lower strengths than RF-M for all curing times. On the one hand, these lower strengths may be due to smaller cement contents, given the very high air content of this mortar (Fig. 7). On the other hand, linseed oil could affect the hydration of the nearby cement matrix. Finally, it is likely that the interface between the cement matrix and the linseed-oil treated fibres is weaker than with raw flax fibres. Indeed, the very smooth surface of the linseed oil-treated fibres (Fig. 1) could reduce their adhesion to the cement. Few authors have also reported an increased porosity at the interface between sunflower aggregates treated with linseed oil and a mineral matrix [22]. 
		 Moreover, in the case of flax-fibre-reinforced mortars, there is a decrease in flexural strength at 320 days compared to 90 days. It is likely that the prolonged contact of the flax fibres with a cement matrix has led to excessive alkaline hydrolysis, which would have damaged the structure of the flax fibres thus affecting their physical and mechanical properties [58,60]. Between 90 and 320 days of cure the rate of reduction of strength is about 12% for all formulations, except LOF-M for which the rate is 14%. The long-term stability of this coating is therefore lower when it is in contact with the cement matrix. Regarding these results, the treatments do not seem to improve the durability of flax fibres in contact with the cementitious matrix. 
		 4.3.3. Toughness 
		 The [I.sub.5] toughness index determined for the different materials are plotted in Fig. 11 as a function of the curing time. 
		 By definition, the toughness index I5 is 1 for the control mortar CM whatever the curing time considered. After 7 days of curing, fibre-reinforced mortars all exhibit high I5 values, which indicates the effectiveness of the fibres in preventing brittle failure. At the young age of 7 days, the ranking of the materials in terms of [I.sub.5] value is RF-M (4.9 [+ or -] 1.7)  SCG-M (4.8 [+ or -] 1.3)  LOF-M (4.2 [+ or -]1.4)  APF-M (3.7 [+ or -] 0.8). After 28 days of curing the toughness indices are lower but the ranking is not modified. After 90 days of curing, none of the fibre-reinforced mortars exhibit toughness higher than the reference material CM. This means that all the composites behave totally brittle. On the surfaces of rupture, no fibre extracted from the cement is visible; the rupture profile is similar to that of the control mortar. Other authors have also observed loss of toughness of cementitious materials incorporating plant fibres over time [60,61]. This decrease or loss of toughness is associated with the alkaline hydrolysis of plant fibres and their mineralisation, which tends to modify the fibre-matrix interface and the structure of the plant fibre. 
		 4.3.4. Compressive strength 
		 The results of the compressive tests carried out on 4 x 4 x 16 cm specimens for the various mortars are presented in Fig. 12. For all formulations, the compressive strengths increase consistently over time, with little variability (low standard deviations). As in bending, the compressive strength of CM increases during the cure from 35.1 [+ or -] 0.9 MPa after 7 days to 41.0 [+ or -] 0.4 MPa after 320 days. The strengths of all fibre-reinforced mortars are similar to that of CM at different ages, except LOF-M, whose strengths are lower and correlate with higher porosities. The 320-days compressive strength of LOF-M is lower than the one after 90 days. This could be explained by the fact that the linseed oil coating on the fibres does not withstand contact with the cement matrix. The weakness of the fibre-matrix interface that results promotes the buckling of the specimen. 
		 During compressive loading, the addition of flax fibres could also limit the transverse deformations of the specimens, during crack opening. Thus, the flax fibres would play a role of 'bracing' effect on the specimen when subjected to a compressive stress. There is also a change in the compressive behaviour of mortars with the incorporation of 1.0 vol.% flax fibres. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4, the stress-strain curve of the RF-M has a different shape than CM. The characteristic slope of the linear behaviour in compression seems to have a less gradient because the deformation corresponding to the maximum stress of RF-M is greater than that of CM. This is consistent with the results of a previous study, where it was noted that the addition of flax fibres in concrete caused a decrease of the material rigidity [15]. Moreover, the post-peak behaviour in compression is also modified. The load drop is less steep for RF-M than for CM. The addition of flax fibres therefore seems to participate in the compressive strength by providing a 'bracing' effect to the specimen and allow a controlled load drop (Fig. 13). 
		 4.3.5. Dynamic modulus of elasticity 
		 Implementation of three-point bending tests on rigid prismatic specimens does not allow a correct measurement of Young's modulus. So, then this parameter was derived by measuring ultrasonic waves' velocities according to Eq. (3). The values of the dynamic elastic modulus of mortars obtained after 28 days of curing are given in Fig. 14. It appears that the classification order of the modules follows that of the densities of the materials. The control mortar CM has the highest dynamic modulus of elasticity (34.2 [+ or -] 1.0 GPa) and RF-M the weakest (23.7 + 1.2 GPa). Mortars incorporating atmospheric plasma (APF-M), slag-cement (SCF-M) and linseed oil (LOF-M) treated fibres have average dynamic modulus of elasticity of 24.9 [+ or -]0.9 GPa, 30.5 [+ or -] 0.6 GPa and 25.3 [+ or -] 0.3 GPa respectively. The addition of fibres is therefore detrimental to the modulus of elasticity. This is in agreement with the results of the non-notched bending tests in Fig. 9. Other authors had also observed a decrease in the elastic modulus of elasticity of mortar reinforced with palm fibres [62]. 
		 5. Conclusion 
		 Several surface treatments of flax fibres have been investigated with a view to reducing the water absorption by these plant fibres known for their great water absorption capacity. This hydrophilicity disturbs the rheological behaviour of the cementitious composites in the fresh state but also affects the physical and mechanical properties in the hardened state. Three fibre coating solutions were explored: surface modification by atmospheric-pressure plasma, mineral slag-cement coating, and coating by using polymeric linseed oil. These treatments were optimised before the incorporation of the fibres into mortar. 
		 The hydroscopic behaviour of raw and treated flax fibres was first studied. It appeared that the flax fibres absorb very rapidly a large amount of water (up to 130% by mass). The atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment modified the water absorption kinetics but not the retention capacity. Conversely, the linseed oil treatment is the only one that actually decreases the water absorption capacity while the slag-cement coating treatment does not modify it. 
		 The comparison between the water absorption of the flax fibre and the rheological behaviour of the mortars shows that the high-water absorption is not the main disruptive factor of the flow of the mixture (case of APF-M). The important increase in the specific surface area of the fibres has a greater effect on the workability (cases of SCF-M and LOF-M). In the hardened state, the presence of flax fibres therefore seems to participate in the compressive strength by providing a 'bracing' effect. It was also noticed that raw and treated flax fibres allow increasing more or less significantly the flexural strength of the composites. The presence of flax fibres also enhances the toughness of mortar for short curing periods, which prevents matrix microcracking. This is an important contribution of the incorporation of fibres into the cement matrix. However, this effect decreases over time until it disappears after 90 days of curing. A chemical modification of the cement matrix could be a viable solution to this issue. Indeed, studies have highlighted a significant degradation of plant fibres in contact with calcium hydroxide [58]. The precipitation of Portlandite on the surface or in the pores of plant fibres leads to embrittlement of these fibres [13,63].

<titre>UPDATE 1-Frankfurt, Paris expect to welcome bankers from London in 2017</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		* Frankfurt dismisses "cemetery" label 
		 * Paris expects 10,000 people to move there from London 
		 * UK Dept of Trade says replicating London will be hard 
		 * Bankers say must plan for hard Brexit (Adds comments by Paris Europlace, government, banking body)
		By Huw Jones 
		 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European financial centres are stepping up a charm offensive, saying they expect banks to start moving some operations from London next year to ensure continued access to the EU market after Britain leaves the bloc. 
		 Frankfurt, Paris, Luxembourg and Dublin are among the centres hoping to attract banks and other institutions from London, Europe's biggest financial centre. 
		 Hubertus Vaeth, chief executive of Frankfurt Main Finance, which promotes Frankfurt as a financial centre, said the aim was not to inflict "as much damage as we can" on the City of London, but to siphon off some of Britain's "entrepreneurial spirit". 
		 "We already see small teams, explorative teams looking into certain aspects," Vaeth told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in London on Monday on how Brexit will affect investment. 
		 "We see options for real estate, and we have very, very clear indications that things will be moved, however, not entire operations," he said. 
		 "We expect them in the second half of next year. The big moves will start in the second half of 2017." 
		 Britain has said it will open formal divorce talks with the European Union by the end of March, but banks say they are already starting to look at relocating some staff and operations in case future access to the EU market turns out to be restricted, a scenario known as a hard Brexit. 
		 "We can only plan on the basis of a hard Brexit," said Ronald Kent, a managing director at the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said. 
		 BBA members say some business could move to continental Europe or New York, or stay in Britain, Kent said, reflecting comments made by U.S. banks and the Bank of England last week. 
		 THOUSANDS TO PARIS 
		 Arnaud de Bresson, chief executive of Paris Europlace, the French financial district, said banks have told him there are only two choices when it comes to relocating operations from London - France or Germany. 
		 "Our estimate is that close to 10,000 people involved in the financial sector could move from London to Paris in the next few years, and Paris is getting fully organised for that," de Bresson said. 
		Paris's financial district has launched an advertising campaign in London with the slogan "Tired of the fog? Try the Frogs! Choose <mention id="2067">Paris La Defense</mention>", referring to <mention id="2068">the Parisian business district</mention>. 
		 Brexit was "bad news" for Europe in terms of global financial market competitiveness, but Paris was working hard to make itself more attractive by cutting taxes for foreigners working in finance, de Bresson said. 
		 He was also in talks with political parties ahead of French presidential elections next year on follow-up reforms to make Paris attractive to bankers. 
		 "We will continue to push vigorously for new tax and social improvements for companies," de Bresson said. 
		 Vaeth said London still has a major role in finance and there was a need to avoid disruption to the industry. 
		 "We believe that Europe needs a global financial centre... but we feel uniquely positioned. We want to do it in a way that is constructive, to build a new London bridge into the euro zone," Vaeth said. 
		 Mark Boleat, head of policy at the City of London Corporation, which runs the British capital's "Square Mile" financial district, said financial firms might need to establish a reasonably sized presence on the continent. 
		 "Applications for licences are being made, property options being looked at, but the big pressing of the button, that is going to come a long way down the line," Boleat said. 
		 "A regulator will want to ensure that the thinking people are there. It's not good just having a few people in Paris. It will require a separate board, senior staff," he said. 
		 Rupert Peters, a senior account manager at Britain's trade and investment ministry, said Frankfurt lacked both the liquidity of Britain's financial markets and its cluster of support services. 
		 Bankers in London have also sometimes complained that Frankfurt would be boring after life in the British capital. 
		 "I am sometimes struck by the fact that Frankfurt is portrayed in the media as something between a cemetery and a backward country. I am getting irritated by that," Vaeth said.

<titre>Woman in hiding tells why she blew whistle on Paris attacker</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		By Brian Love 
		 PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A woman whose phone tip-off allowed police to corner and kill the ringleader of the Nov. 13 assault on Paris has spoken for the first time of his plans for a follow-up attack and how he bragged about entering France with 90 others from Syria. 
		 The woman, in hiding and under police protection, contacted a French radio station to complain of wat she deems insufficient support from the public authorities, and she also talked of the events that led police to Islamist militant Abdelhamid Abaaoud.
		Abaaoud died when elite police laid siege to his hideout flat in Saint Denis north of Paris on Nov. 18, days after the Islamic State-claimed attacks in which he and a large group of militants killed 130 people in and near the French capital. 
		 The woman said she was present when her friend was contacted to find a hideout for Abaaoud, and then met Abaaoud himself. 
		 "I said to him: 'but you have killed innocent people'. He says to me, 'no they are not innocent, you should look at what's going on in Syria'," the woman, whose identity was hidden, said in the interview for RMC radio and television news channel BFM. 
		 The woman met Abaaoud because she was a friend of his cousin, Hasna Ait Boulahcen, who died alongside Abaaoud in the police raid. The Nov. 13 attacks were claimed by Islamic State, the group that controls swathes of Syria and Iraq and whose positions are being bombed by French jets. 
		 The woman said she learned from Abaaoud himself and further conversations with his cousin of his plans to imminently launch new attacks on a creche, police station and shopping mall in <mention id="2069">the La Defense business district on the western edge of Paris</mention>. She says that made her decide to call a special hot line. 
		 "She tells me that it's for Thursday and I say to myself I'm going to stop them," the woman said, referring to the moment when her friend Ait Boulahecen told her the precise attack date. 
		 Hours later, police laid siege to the flat where Abaaoud was holed up with cousin Ait Boulhacen and a third person who took part with Abaaoud in the Nov. 13 attacks, another Belgian or Moroccan descent, Chakib Akrouh. 
		 The Paris prosecutor's office said it was investigating a potential breach of secrecy laws in response to the interview broadcast on Thursday. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said her media exposure could put her in danger. 
		 The woman complained of having no social life, no job and no psychological support more than two months after the attacks, and said she still had no new identity papers to match the false name she was now obliged to use. 
		 Speaking of Abaaoud's lack of remorse and determination to kill more people, the woman said: "He's proud of himself. He tells it as if he'd gone shopping and found a pack of cut-price washing powder. He's happy." 
		 She said he also told her of how he and 90 others - Syrians, Iraqis, Germans, French and Britons - entered the country from Syria without any official papers ahead of the attacks. "France is zero," she said he told her.

		 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - The prospect of Britain quitting the European Union has inflicted little damage so far on demand for space in London's financial hubs, first quarter rental data suggests, despite some warning signs from investment banks. 
		 A year after Prime Minister David Cameron's election win fired the starting gun on the European Union membership vote, London remains Europe's most 'in-demand' office market, and there is little sign of an uptick in rivals Frankfurt and Paris.
		Research from real estate broker CBRE shows only 2.9 percent of total office space in the City, London's historic financial district, was available for rent in the first three months of 2016, compared with 12.2 percent in Frankfurt, 6.3 percent in Berlin and 6.8 percent in Paris. 
		 Rents are also rising, underlining demand among occupiers, although early second quarter indicators on yields suggest investor confidence has started to wane. 
		 Such figures may assuage concerns among those worried that firms would slash their London operations or even abandon the UK capital altogether, in the run-up to the June 23 referendum. 
		 Uncertainty has infected broader market sentiment, with Britain's pound losing 5.6 percent of its value against the dollar and 10.3 percent against the euro in the past six months. 
		 But London's real estate market is holding firm. 
		 Prime rents in the City rose 7.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, compared with 1.3 percent growth in Frankfurt and zero growth in Paris, according to CBRE. 
		 "Leasing is a pretty big decision for most companies and we have seen quite a scramble for space in London over the last few years. Most companies are still expecting a vote to remain," Neil Blake, CBRE head of research, said. 
		 Meanwhile, rents in London's skyscrapers are rising faster than those in any other global city, according to the latest Skyscraper Index from property services firm Knight Frank. 
		 The report, which examines the rental performance of commercial buildings over 30 stories across the world, shows that average rents in London skyscrapers rose 9.7 percent to $126 per square foot in the second half of 2015. 
		 Skyscraper rents in <mention id="2070">Paris' La Defense financial district</mention> were flat over the same period, while in Frankfurt, rents actually dropped 1.16 percent. 
		 "There has been much debate around the future of London's skyline but the rental performance of the capital's skyscrapers points to the fact there is huge demand for space in landmark, tall buildings," Will Beardmore-Gray, head of Knight Frank's Tenant Rep and Agency Business, said. 
		 "We expect upward pressure on rents to continue," he said. 
		 WARNING SHOTS 
		 One of the reasons is that major banks reckon there is no easy alternative to London, home to the European headquarters of the likes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Citi. 
		 "Nowhere else has scale, nowhere has a major market in this time zone. Nowhere comes close to London," said one senior executive at an investment bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
		 Reflecting this, Swiss bank UBS is preparing to move into a newly built 65,000 square meter City base, and construction is underway to create a 111,500 square meter European headquarters for Goldman Sachs. 
		 But despite the resilience of London's rental market, there are signs that investors are retreating as the referendum nears. 
		 Average prime rental yields on UK commercial property, which reflect investment interest, nudged up 7 basis points to 4.69 percent in April, the biggest monthly change since June 2010, data from Savills shows. 
		 This means buyers are demanding more annual income from a property deal to offset the risk of their investment. The caution follows speculation that some banks might consider moving if Britain does leave. 
		 French finance minister Michel Sapin said on Thursday some French banks had told him Brexit would have consequences for some of their London-based activities. 
		 HSBC has said it could move around 1,000 employees from London to Paris in the event of a vote to leave the EU and other banks are privately contingency planning for the activities they may have to shift out of the British capital. 
		 Martin Shanahan, boss of IDA Ireland, the Irish government agency responsible for foreign direct investment said in March he had met with financial services firms who were weighing contingency plans which could include relocation to Ireland. 
		 Credit Suisse has already shifted some trading jobs to Dublin, and is looking at moving nearly 2,000 jobs out of the London to lower costs centers such as in Poland and India, a trend that started independently of the Brexit debate but could well be accelerated as banks continue to rationalize costs.

<titre>"Paris calling": Paris authorities and lobbyists seek to lure bankers from London</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		By Maya Nikolaeva 
		 PARIS, June 8 (Reuters) - Paris can be an alternative to London for financial professionals in the event of Britain voting to leave the European Union, backers of a major marketing campaign said on Wednesday just two weeks before the British referendum. 
		 European financial centres, such as Dublin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg or Paris, will be anxious to attract as big a share as possible of the UK's financial industry if Britain votes 'out' on June 23.
		"The referendum has encouraged major international companies, particularly in London and New York, to consider rebalancing their businesses towards the euro zone," Gerard Mestrallet, head of the Paris marketplace lobby, said. 
		 "For this reason, we as a group are ready to promote the competitiveness and appeal of the Paris financial marketplace," said at a conference dubbed "Paris: Welcome to Europe". 
		 The initiative, bringing together officials from the Socialist-controlled Paris City Hall, opposition conservative leaders and financial professionals, was the biggest coordinated push by Paris so far to get a slice of the UK finance cake in the event of victory for Brexit. 
		 "Britain can't blackmail Europe for ever without getting a response at some point," said Patrick Devedjian, head of the big business Hauts-de-Seine area, referring to British demands for opt-outs from many EU policies. 
		 However, France should stop bashing bankers and ease its tax regime for financial institutions if it wants to mop up London business, some said. 
		 "I heard our president say that our enemy is finance. There is nothing more stupid. Our enemy is unemployment," Valerie Pecresse, the conservative head of the wider Paris region said, adding that a strong financial sector was essential for French sovereignty. 
		 Though undergoing tough times with banking job cuts, strategy overhauls and the forthcoming referendum, London remains the key destination for bankers, including those with French passports, who feel under-appreciated and overtaxed by the centre-left government at home. 
		 "Let's be honest, we are in the challenger position," Societe Generale CEO Frederic Oudea said at the event at <mention id="2071">La Defense</mention>, <mention id="2072">once a beacon of French financial might</mention>. 
		 He urged a rethink on France's tax system which many see as punitive and a deterrent to business. 
		 Elected in 2012 on traditional left-wing rhetoric that included labelling the world of finance as "the enemy", President Francois Hollande slapped a 75 percent tax on millionaires which, although temporary, dented France's image among investors, according to French officials. 
		 Despite a pro-business U-turn in 2014 - which saw his prime minister tour world cities to claim his "love for business" - and the fact that the top rate of income tax is now the same as in Britain, Paris has struggled to lure over bankers. 
		 The Paris Europlace financial lobby called for more tax incentives, such as an extension of tax relief for expatriates to ten from five years and urged authorities to upgrade key infrastructure in Paris in the coming years. 
		 In particular, they called for a quick completion of the long planned express train link from Charles de Gaulle airport to the city centre and a renovation of the Gare du Nord train station, often unfavourably compared to the recently upgraded St Pancras station across the Channel in London. 
		 However, major initiatives by the Socialist government to help the banking sector less than a year ahead of presidential elections would be something unrealistic in France. 
		 Despite the clear will to position Paris as a continental alternative, none of the officials said they were in favour of Britain leaving the EU. 
		 "Our generation should prevent this (Brexit) from happening ... it (Brexit) would be the most significant event on the continent since the fall of the Berlin Wall," said Stephane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, operator of the Paris bourse.

<titre>UPDATE 1-GE says plans to cut 6,500 jobs in Europe in next two years</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Adds details of Swiss jobs, background) 
		 PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - General Electric plans to cut 6,500 jobs in Europe over the next two years, including 765 in France and 1,300 in Switzerland, the company said on Wednesday. 
		 A GE spokesman in France said GE was sticking to its pledge to create 1,000 net jobs in France in the next three years as part of its acquisition of Alstom's energy business.
		He added that the company was looking at job cuts at its headquarters in Levallois and <mention id="2073">La Defense</mention>, but not at Belfort, the heart of Alstom's former energy unit. 
		 He said that unions had been informed on Tuesday and that talks would start on Wednesday. The jobs concerned were mainly in support functions such as human resources, legal and communication. 
		 "This is a plan, which could change following discussion with employee representatives," he said. 
		 He gave no details on which other countries would be hit, but GE said in a separate statement that it had begun talks with workers in Switzerland, where 1,300 jobs could be impacted by the measures. 
		 Those cuts were expected to be in the gas and steam power businesses, which have experienced a slump in recent years. 
		 GE's takeover of Alstom's energy business - which includes gas and steam turbines, wind turbines, turbines for hydro dams and power grids - added about 65,000 employees to GE's workforce of about 305,000 and significantly expanded GE's reach in the global market for power generation equipment. 
		 The head of GE's power division said in September the company would seek to wring out $3 billion in cost savings over five years from the Alstom acquisition.

<titre>France at war: Aux armes</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Between missions abroad and at home, French military power is stretched thin 
		 A TRIO of soldiers in full combat gear advances in triangular formation, heads swivelling from left to right. On this bright spring afternoon, the unit has been deployed to patrol <mention id="2074">La Défense</mention>. But this is not a military site. It is <mention id="2075">a shopping-mall and office-tower district</mention> to the west of Paris, named after a statue commemorating the capital's defence during the Franco-Prussian war. The soldiers are part of Operation Sentinelle, patrolling the streets under France's state of emergency. 
		 When the operation was first launched, patrolling transport hubs and places of worship after the terrorist attacks in January 2015, the idea was to reduce its size as the threat subsided. After terrorists struck Paris again last November, however, President François Hollande imposed a state of emergency, and Sentinelle was reinforced to its full quota of 10,000 troops. The government is now seeking a third extension of the state of emergency to cover the European football championships this summer. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the defence minister, says the operation will continue "as long as necessary".
		For military planners, this is a challenge. Sentinelle is the biggest military operation on home soil since the Algerian war in the 1960s. The French army had planned the capacity to provide 10,000 soldiers for a domestic emergency, but not permanently. Now the strains are showing. General Pierre de Villiers, chief of the French armed forces, said recently that the army was operating "at its limit". 
		 To try to meet the challenge, last year Mr Hollande raised defence spending by EUR3.8 billion ($4.4 billion) over four years and expanded France's operational ground force from 66,000 to 77,000. But the extra soldiers will take time to train. Meanwhile, the army has had to make do. Some exercises have been cancelled. The number of training days between missions has shrunk far below the NATO norm of 90. Last year 70,000 French soldiers took part in Operation Sentinelle, some serving five or six rotations. There is "a risk of being worn out between domestic and foreign operations", said Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, a centre-right MP, who recently visited French troops in the Sahel. 
		 Meanwhile there have been complaints about "rustic" camp conditions in Paris, and a lack of beds. Some soldiers are camping in empty former defence-ministry offices. Families, a report noted, seem less tolerant of absences when soldiers are sent to patrol Paris rather than on missions abroad. Morale needs managing, too. The terrorist attacks have prompted a surge in new recruits, but it is not obvious that they signed up to patrol shopping centres. 
		 In the longer run, France may have trouble maintaining its activist defence and security policy abroad. Other European countries that deploy a heavy military force at home, such as Italy, do not also aspire to project force outside their neighbourhood. In 2013 France dispatched 4,500 troops to beat back an Islamist incursion in Mali; America's RAND Corporation, a think-tank, called it a model expeditionary force. It sent another 2,000 troops to the Central African Republic, to control a "pre-genocidal" situation. France was the first European country to join the American-led coalition striking Islamic State in Iraq, and later Syria. 
		 Overstretch could curb the capacity to respond to new threats. "Our technical capacity is very good," says General Vincent Desportes, a former army officer and critic of Operation Sentinelle. "But clearly France is in no position to commit to any further adventure." French expeditionary culture is hardy: in Mali, where soldiers endure desert conditions without optimal supplies or equipment, the army "makes coping with austerity a point of pride", notes RAND admiringly. But there is a pressing need for more attack helicopters and drones. 
		 Mr Le Drian has described facing the new threat as "entering a different era". A parliamentary report last year referred to a "change in paradigm". The most recent strategic defence review, though, was in 2013; it is already outdated. If France's domestic operation becomes permanent, say analysts, the government will need to do much more than just reverse defence cuts. 
		 France's pull-out from Afghanistan in 2014 did not much affect the allied mission there, observes Camille Grand, director of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think-tank. But had it not intervened in Mali, "where our troops are involved in real fighting", there would have been serious consequences for regional and ultimately European security. France is one of the few Western countries that still projects force abroad. But with its new domestic-security worries, it will need to spend more to continue doing so.

<titre>Turkey time: Europe's Erdogan dilemma</titre>
<auteur>ALEX BARKER</auteur>
<texte>
		Not even the clocks in Turkey can ignore the whims of Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This weekend Turkey's imperious president decided to make it summertime all year. The decision to abandon daylight saving time moves Ankara an hour further from Europe, and into a timezone with Khartoum, Moscow and Riyadh. If only that were the end of it. 
		 Mr Erdogan issued decrees to oust 10,158 public officials; expelled 1,267 academics from their posts; took charge of appointing university rectors; permitted prosecutors to record client-lawyer conversations; allowed judges to deny access to lawyers for up to three months; and shut down 15 (mainly Kurdish) media outlets. And that was just this weekend.
		Don't forget the more than 100,000 accused, sacked or detained in relation to the botched coup in July, or the internet blackout across swathes of majority Kurdish areas in the southeast, or the detention and arrest of the elected mayors of Diyarbakir. 
		 Then there is matter of the death penalty. Since the attempted coup - a watershed moment for modern Turkey that FAZ calls the beginning of its second republic - Mr Erdogan's rhetoric has swung from hot to lukewarm on whether to reinstate capital punishment, which was dropped in 2004 as part of Turkey's EU membership bid. This weekend it turned red hot. Sporting a pair of black aviator sunglasses, Mr Erdogan bellowed these words on Saturday to a crowd chanting: "Execution! Execution!" 
		 "Our government will take this proposal [on capital punishment] to parliament. I am sure parliament will approve it, and when it comes back to me, I will ratify it...Soon, soon, don't worry. It's happening soon, God willing. The West says this, the West says that. Excuse me, but what counts is not what the West says. What counts is what my people say." 
		What should Europe do? The Economist's Charlemagne column recently gave an eloquent defence of continuing Turkey's implausible EU membership bid (headline: two cheers for hypocrisy!). There are good reasons to avoid facing the reality of the situation. Both sides have too much at stake to risk being honest. Even so, it seems Mr Erdogan is doing his level best to bring the charade crashing down. 
		 Officials in Brussels and Berlin mostly worry about the Turkey-EU migration deal collapsing and migrant flows to the Greek islands restarting. Under one scenario, Europe's attempt at  realpolitik  would implode. Mr Erdogan would compromise, meet the EU's conditions for visa free travel - basically complete his side the migration-deal bargain - only to find Europe's politicians block the travel rights anyway. Mr Erdogan would cry foul and walk away and the Aegean migration route could reopen. 
		 There is another scenario that is just as worrying. Mr Erdogan would not bend or ask Europe for favours on visas. He would just carry on accusing the EU of betrayal. Meanwhile he would flout every EU norm going, hollow out what is left of Turkey's democracy and even perhaps reinstate the death penalty. Each step would expose the EU's accession policy to ridicule. And each step would effectively dare the EU to act, knowing the bloc's fear of migration is greater than its fear of him, or its faithfulness to democratic values. Whatever the clocks may say, these are hard times indeed.

		 BREXITLAND 
		Carney open to staying  Whatever barbs the Brexiters may throw at him, Mark Carney is ready to serve an 8-year term at the Bank of England. That's the topline of an authoritative report from the FT's Chris Giles. 
		 Mr Carney is said to be leaning strongly towards staying in his post. He would like to help steer the UK economy through treacherous waters once the government triggers Article 50 in March 2017, starting a two-year clock on divorce negotiations with Brussels. "Mid-2018 could be the darkest days for the UK," said a person familiar with the governor's thinking. 
		The Halloween campaign  Some Brexiters were sensing blood when the Canadian governor, stung by a campaign of criticism in the run-up to Halloween, was wavering over whether to seek a full 8-year term. David Marsh of OMFIF outlines what is at stake: 
		 you do not hint at changing the rules of engagement between Downing Street and Threadneedle Street during what is starting to resemble a good old-fashioned sterling crisis. Down that path lies perdition. 
		What was Nissan promised?  Greg Clark, Britain's business secretary, was more revealing in a BBC interview on Sunday than any minister has been in the Commons about Brexit plans. The government's aim is to ensure carmakers in Britain face no tariffs or other "bureaucratic impediments". 
		 "Our objective would be to ensure we have continued access to the markets in Europe and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments, and that is how we will approach those negotiations. There is a lot in common that we can establish." 
		Mr Clark was less clear about how that can be achieved while Britain leaves the EU. The Guardian's Patrick Wintour chronicles the many open questions and dilemmas. The FT has previously reported that Whitehall was looking at models to keep Britain's carmakers in the customs union. Sceptical of implausible hybrid solutions, Wolfgang Münchau reckons the Nissan affair can only mean one thing: Theresa May will lead Britain out of the EU and into the EEA. 
		 The philosopher Friedrich Hegel described historical processes in terms of "thesis, antithesis and synthesis" - an initial phase where one particular view holds, then the opposite, followed by compromise. So far the Brexit debate appears to be dutifully following Hegelian logic. The widespread assumption that Britain would remain in the EU gave way, after the June referendum, to the antithesis: the prospect of "hard" Brexit. Now, courtesy of Japanese carmaker Nissan, we have glimpsed the possible synthesis: a soft Brexit whereby Britain would retain full membership of the EU single market. 
		Come to France!  Paris is setting up a team of business leaders and politicians to lure big business out of Brexit Britain. At the helm is Ross McInnes, an Oxford-educated Franco-Australian and chairman of Safran, the French engine maker. This is all another excuse to recall the ad campaign launched by <mention id="2076">Paris's La Défense business district</mention>: "Tired of the fog? Try the frogs!" 
		 ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE 
		Iceland turns conformist  In their election on Sunday, Icelanders opted for a traditional party of power rather than the upstart Pirates who made headway in the polls. The centre-right Independence party, which has been in power for most of the past 70 years, will be in the driving seat in coalition talks. 
		 Valls turns on Hollande?  Le Figaro reports that the French prime minister Manuel Valls is starting to sharpen his knives for Francois Hollande, citing his dismay over the president's explosively contentious interviews with two Le Monde journalists. 
		 Sloppy Oettinger  There was no apology. But the newly promoted German commissioner Gunter Oettinger did admit using a "sloppy expression" when referring to schlitzaugen - or slit eyes - during a trip to China last month. 
		 In an interview with Die Welt, Mr Oettinger said it was important to look at the "overall context" of where he was speaking. He had received "lots of positive reaction" after the speech. There have been a few calls for Mr Oettinger to resign, not least from Volker Beck, a Green politician, who described Mr Oettinger as a "lunatic goblin". For those who have not seen the full video, here are his views on the Chinese leadership and Europe's malaise: 
		 Nine men, one party. No democracy, no female quota, and no women - which follows logically. All of them in dark blue, single-breasted suits. All of them had their hair combed from left to right, with black shoe-polish. And what about us? Soon we will have more committees than inhabitants.

		 * Protesters say oil and gas industry drives global warming 
		 * Total CEO says addressing climate change is not easy 
		 * Says focuses on efficiency, gas and low-carbon power (Adds Total CEO comment)
		By Bate Felix 
		 PARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - Climate activists blocked thousands of employees from entering the headquarters of French bank Societe Generale, state-run utility EDF and oil giant Total on Friday, environmental group Greenpeace said. 
		 Greenpeace said it was protesting against company links to the oil and gas industry, which it calls a driving force in global warming. Activists also obstructed the entrance to the environment ministry near <mention id="2079">La Defense business district</mention>. 
		 Protesters plastered giant posters of President Emmanuel Macron carrying the slogan "Macron, President of Polluters" and a banner reading "Scene of Climate Crime" on the glass facade of Societe Generale, Reuters TV images showed. 
		 Police pepper-sprayed one group blocking the bank's main entrance in a sit-down protest. 
		 Some demonstrators taped themselves together while others cuffed themselves with plastic ties to metal poles to make it harder for police to dislodge them. 
		 Employees in business suits milled around outside their offices. "I just want to get inside and on with my work," one frustrated bank employee said. 
		 Greenpeace and action group Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) have previously criticized Societe Generale for its role in financing oil and gas projects, in particular the Rio Grande LNG gas project in the United States. 
		 A Societe Generale spokesman declined to comment. 
		 ACTION NOT EASY 
		 A spokesman for EDF, which relies heavily on nuclear and hydropower plants to generate electricity, said 96 percent of its power was carbon dioxide-free. He said EDF was committed to curbing its total carbon footprint by 40 percent by 2030. 
		 A Total spokeswoman said two senior company executives had held talks with representatives of Greenpeace and Les Amis de la Terre. 
		 At an oil industry summit in Paris on Friday, Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne acknowledged the climate change protests. 
		 "Many people are demonstrating in Paris and are asking for more action. We all know it is not so easy because the population's primary request is for access to more energy, affordable energy and it has to be clean," he said. 
		 He added that Total was trying to address climate change by improving the efficiency of its operations, growing its natural gas business and developing an electricity business based on low-carbon gas and renewables. 
		 He also said Total had increased its output to 2.95 million barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, passing its 2018 record, aided by increased production in Australia, Angola, Nigeria and Russia. 
		 Friday's protest echoed a series by the Extinction Rebellion group of climate-change campaigners in London this week that have caused transport snarl-ups in the British capital. 
		 Teenage demonstrators staged an emotional protest, weeping and singing, at political inaction on climate change near London's Heathrow Airport on Friday.

		 (C)1994-2019 M2 COMMUNICATIONS 
		 RDATE:19072019 
		 KAMPALA, Uganda -- Brian Warshawsky, co-founder and current COO of Fenix to succeed the current CEO, Lyndsay Handler.
		Jit Bhattacharya, CTO and Chris Bagnall, Group Marketing Director, step down from the company with successions plans in place. New CFO appointed and Head of Credit position established alongside new Chief Commercial Officer, Junior Zerebela Kwebiiha within executive team. 
		 Fenix International (https://www.FenixIntl.com/), a company of ENGIE, offering Solar Home Systems across Africa has appointed co-founder and current COO Brian Warshawsky to the role of CEO to drive the next phase of the company's ambitious growth plans. Warshawsky is succeeding Lyndsay Handler who has been with the company for 7 years and served as CEO since 2016. Warshawsky is well-placed to lead the company, having previously spent 5 years at Apple as part of the iPod Operations team before co-founding Fenix International in 2009. Having worked as COO with Fenix from inception, Brian has a deep understanding of the business from product design to manufacturing, country operations, distribution and last-mile customer experience. 
		 Ivan Topalov, who previously served as Corporate Finance Director has been promoted to Chief Financial Officer following the departure of the previous CFO, Josh Romisher, in June. The company has also appointed a new Head of Customer Credit, Alison Boess, reporting to the CEO. 
		 Yoven Moorooven, CEO of ENGIE Africa, said, "Brian is a highly regarded leader with the right mix of skills and experience to lead this new chapter for Fenix as we continue to establish ourselves as the market leader across Africa. With commercial operations in Uganda, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Benin and Mozambique, Fenix is growing from strength to strength. Under Brian's leadership I'm incredibly excited for the future of our decentralized energy offering in Africa." 
		 He continued, "I join everyone at ENGIE and the Fenix team in thanking Lyndsay, Jit and Chris for their many years of dedicated service and commitment to the Fenix Mission. Under their leadership, Fenix transformed millions of lives across the continent and built an inspiring team that is driven to succeed." 
		 Brian Warshawsky, newly appointed CEO commented, "While it is difficult to say goodbye to such incredible colleagues and collaborators through so many years, I'm proud to be able to continue their legacy. On behalf of the Fenix team I would like to thank Jit for his technology leadership and the work he did to build Fenix Power, our next generation solar home system platform. I would like to thank Chris for his commercial and marketing leadership as Fenix grew from a few customers in Uganda to 500,000 customers across 6 countries in Africa. And I would like to especially thank Lyndsay for leading Fenix through so many milestones, most recently the ENGIE acquisition and establishing Fenix as the strongest off-grid solar home system company in the industry." 
		 He added, "Backed by a world class product, a world class team and with the full support of ENGIE, I am excited for what we will do to take our life changing product to customers across the continent. We are now set for an exciting future as we continue our expansion across Africa and achieving universal energy access for all." 
		 Lyndsay Handler added, "Building Fenix from 2011 to 2017 and accelerating our growth following the acquisition by ENGIE in 2018 has truly been an honour. Together, we have delivered clean, affordable energy to over 500,000 households or 2.5 million people in six countries across Africa. I am especially proud of the way we built a passionate Fenix team based in Africa who are deeply committed to our mission, values, and customers. Looking ahead, I am happy to pass the torch to our co-founder Brian and I am confident that the entire team will put the customer first in all that we do in Fenix's next chapter. I hope that Fenix will continue to create new products and drive forward innovation so that clean energy is affordable to all at the last mile."

<titre>FRANCE-PROTESTS/ (PIX, TV) French 'yellow vest' protests largely peacefully as Macron wraps up debate</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 By Dominique Vidalon and Simon Carraud  
		 * Thousands march across France for 21st straight weekend 
		 * French PM to outline initial findings of debate on April 8 
		 * President Macron to make post-debate proposals this month
		By Dominique Vidalon and Simon Carraud 
		 PARIS, April 6 (Reuters) - Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Paris and other French cities on Saturday for a 21st straight weekend of anti-government "yellow vest" protests, but the marches were largely peaceful. 
		 The quieter nature of the demonstrations should be a relief to President Emmanuel Macron, who this week wrapped up two months of nationwide town hall meetings as part of his "grand debat" initiative. 
		 Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is due on Monday to outline the initial findings that emerged from hours of discussions with local mayors and officials, high-school students, workers, intellectuals as well as 1.9 million online contributions. 
		 Macron, who launched the debate in a bid to calm the protests and determine which policies people want the government to focus on, is due to announce proposals based on the results later this month. 
		 By early afternoon on Saturday, there were 21 arrests in Paris and also a few clashes with police in Rouen on the margins of otherwise peaceful demonstrations. 
		 Protesters carrying French flags and holding signs calling for referendums tabled by citizens also marched largely without violence in Bordeaux and Lille. 
		 The protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets worn by demonstrators, began in November as an expression of public anger against fuel tax increases. 
		 The movement soon morphed into a broader backlash against Macron's government, despite a swift reversal of the tax increases and other hurried measures worth more than 10 billion euros to boost purchasing power for less affluent voters. 
		 By 1200 GMT on Saturday, turnout was 6,300 demonstrators nationwide, according to government estimates, compared with 5,600 at the same time a week earlier. 
		 In Paris, two rallies had been authorised, including one from Place de la Republique in the east to <mention id="2085">La Defense business district</mention> in the west. Turnout was 3,100 by 1200 GMT against 1,800 at the same time last week. It was difficult to compare the figures because this week's marches started earlier than last week. 
		 As in recent weeks, authorities banned protests in potential trouble spots, including the French capital's Champs Elysees, fearing a repetition of the vandalism seen three weeks earlier. (Editing by Helen Popper)

		 (Adds protest at Paris shopping mall) 
		 By Christian Lowe and Sarah White 
		 PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Activists staged protests against online retailer Amazon around France on Friday and tried to blockade a shopping mall in Paris, denouncing the rampant consumerism of the U.S. Black Friday shopping frenzy that has spread to European shores.
		French companies have embraced the discount shopping day held the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday since it was brought to Europe by Amazon and others. However, there has also been a backlash, driven in part by environmental concerns. 
		 In Spain, protesters also put up a banner in the heart of Madrid that read: "Consumerism = climate crisis." 
		 Several dozen demonstrators gathered at dawn outside an Amazon headquarters building in the Clichy district of Paris for a sit-down protest outside the front gates. They held up a sign saying: "No to Amazon and its world." 
		 Manon Aubry, a left-wing member of the European parliament, said the protest was intended to "denounce the social, environmental and fiscal damage from Amazon." 
		 "From the streets to parliament, we continue to fight against the impunity of the multinationals," she wrote on Twitter. 
		 According to social media posts from Attac, a group that campaigns for more democratic globalization, there was also a sit-down protest outside an Amazon logistics center near Lyon, in eastern France. 
		 Video posted online by Attac showed police in riot helmets picking up activists and hauling them away. The Lyon protesters had erected a sign saying: "Amazon ... Stop expansion, Stop Over-production!" 
		 In a e-mailed statement, Amazon France said it respected the rights of people to express their opinions but that did not extend to organizing violent demonstrations where people work. 
		 "The demonstrators and Attac are throwing around untrue allegations based on factual errors and are pointing the finger at Amazon for political ends," it said. 
		 Some 40 young protesters attempted to block the doorway of <meronyme id="2086">a large shopping center</meronyme> in <mention id="2087">La Defense business district</mention> in Paris on Friday morning by locking arms, though passers by were still able to get through. 
		 The demonstrators, who also gathered outside shops inside the mall, chanted "Work, consume and shut up, that is the message given to our youth." 
		 "We're changing Black Friday into Block Friday, it is a symbol of capitalism," said one of the protesters, Raphael. 
		 Francois Momboisse, president of French online retail association Fevad, condemned the protests. 
		 "Black Friday is one of the top sales days of the year and it allows us to smooth out Christmas shopping over a longer period rather than compressing all those sales in the Dec. 10 to 24 period. It does not necessarily lead to more consumption," he told French broadcaster BFM TV. 
		 French lawmakers on Monday passed a legislative amendment to ban misleading promotions during sale periods, taking aim at Black Friday campaigns in particular. 
		 The amendment is part of a new law aimed at cracking down on waste, which will push companies to recycle unsold goods. It is not clear how misleading advertising will be defined or penalized. 
		 The text of the amendment described Black Friday as a "vast operation for the glorification of consumerism imported from the United States." (Additional reporting by Geert De Clercq and Noemie Olive in Paris and Ashifa Kassam in Madrid; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Mark Potter)

		 PARIS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Paris plans to expand its urban cooling system, which uses a network of underground water pipes, and make it available to small companies and residential buildings as global warming increases the number of aircon units in the city, deputy mayor Jean-Louis Missika said on Monday. 
		 Paris, in partnership with French utility Engie, operates a cooling grid using water from the Seine river, but the 75 km (47 mile) network mainly services hospitals, hotels, museums and department stores. It has no residential customers. 
		 "We do not want global warming to lead to a profusion of individual aircon units. These are inefficient, polluting and they add to local warming. And they are ugly," Missika told Reuters on the sidelines of an Engie seminar. 
		 France has seen a series of heatwaves in recent summers and on July 25 the French capital recorded a temperature of 40.6 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit), the hottest since records began. 
		 Missika said Paris wants its Climespace cooling network - Europe's biggest - to cover 100% of the city's area over the next 20 years, from about 43% today, and make it available to non-institutional customers. 
		 "It must be possible to connect the cooling grid to residential buildings as well as to small businesses," he said, adding that the city is already discussing this with social housing operators RIVP and Paris Habitat. 
		 The expansion of the cooling network will be part of the criteria in a new tender for the operation of the network, which for the past 30 years has been run by Engie unit Climespace, which had 2018 revenue of 91 million euros ($100 million). 
		 Paris has a minority stake in Climespace, via Paris urban heating grid operator CPCU, which is 66.5% owned by Engie and the rest by Paris. 
		 Missika said the city plans to organize a tender in 2020 with a view to put a new operator in place by February 2021. 
		 Asked whether it would be conceivable that the tender would not be won by long-time Paris partner Engie, Missika said he expected many firms will want to bid for the 20-year contract. 
		 He declined to comment on potential bidders, but insiders say these could include Dalkia, the energy services unit of French utility EDF, and energy infrastructure group Idex, which is owned by investment fund Antin and operates the heating and cooling grid of <mention id="2089">Paris business district La Defense</mention>. 
		 Missika said Paris is also looking into bringing natural cooling into the 19th century Haussmann buildings that make up a large part of its housing stock, by using defunct chimneys for ventilation. ($1 = 0.9073 euros) (Reporting by Geert De Clercq, editing by Louise Heavens)

<titre>RUGBY-UNION-CHAMPIONS-RAC-SAR/ Rugby-Saracens begin European title defence with heavy loss at Racing 92</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		Nov 17 (Reuters) - A weakened Saracens team were hammered 30-10 by French side Racing 92 as their European Champions Cup title defence started with a crushing defeat on Sunday. 
		 Saracens were without England internationals Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Billy and Mako Vunipola, who were part of the World Cup campaign in which Eddie Jones' side finished runners-up behind South Africa in Japan earlier this month.
		The English champions had said they may have to prioritise Premiership survival over European ambitions after being docked 35 points and fined 5.36 million pounds ($6.86 million) by the Premiership for breaching salary cap rules. 
		 The club had said they would appeal the punishment which, if upheld, would leave them bottom of the table with -22 points and in danger of relegation thereby putting the futures of some of their key players in doubt. 
		 However, British media reported on Sunday that Saracens would drop their plans to appeal ahead of Monday's deadline. 
		 The club could also face action from European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) after their representatives pulled out of the season's launch of the Champions Cup in Cardiff last week. 
		 Tries from Virimi Vakatawa, Teddy Thomas, Finn Russell and Wenceslas Lauret ensured Top 14 side Racing 92 secured a bonus-point win in the Pool 4 clash at <mention id="2090">La Defense Arena</mention> on Sunday. 
		 Saracens centre Alex Lozowski, who had said earlier this week that the club could handle the fallout of their salary cap breach, scored his team's only try. 
		 Saracens host Ospreys in their next fixture on Nov. 23.

<titre>ASIA-SECURITY/USA-IRAN As Shanahan heads to Asia, Iran tensions threaten Pentagon's 'great power' focus</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 By Idrees Ali  
		 By Idrees Ali 
		 WASHINGTON, May 28 (Reuters) - As acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan heads to Asia on Tuesday to deliver a major policy speech on the region, increasing tensions with Iran threaten to upend the Pentagon's strategy to focus on "great power competition" and countering Russia and China, officials and experts say. 
		 In January 2018, the U.S. military put China and Russia at the center of a new national defense strategy, shifting priorities after more than a decade and a half of focusing on the fight against Islamist militants.
		On his first day as acting defense secretary in January, Shanahan told civilian leaders of the U.S. military to focus on "China, China, China." 
		 But escalating tension with Iran over the past month could impair that focus. The U.S. military has cited what it sees as a threat of potential attack by Iran to deploy hundreds of troops to the region, in addition to Patriot missiles, bombers and the accelerated movement of a carrier strike group. 
		 The United States on Friday announced the deployment of 1,500 troops to the Middle East, describing it as an effort to bolster defenses against Iran as it accused the country's Revolutionary Guards of direct responsibility for this month’s tanker attacks off the United Arab Emirates. 
		 Those deployments are small compared with the nearly 70,000 American troops stationed across the Middle East and Afghanistan and are not enough to change the Pentagon strategy. But a period of protracted tensions could set it back. 
		 "The greatest way to kill the National Defense Strategy and its focus on long-term competition and preparing for the possibility of conflict with China and Russia is to start another war in the Middle East," said Mara Karlin, a former Pentagon official now with the Brookings Institution. 
		 Karlin said it was not just conflict with Iran that would distract the Pentagon from its own strategy, but that planning itself can consume resources. 
		 A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Pentagon leadership was spending time discussing the question of what a large-scale conflict with Iran could mean for the focus on China and Russia. 
		 The official said the hope was that the deterrence measures being used by the Pentagon - sending aircraft and ships to the region - would be enough to stave off a major conflict with Iran. 
		 U.S. allies in Asia, as well as China, are highly sensitive to the degree of American focus on their region, said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia. 
		 "They watch very closely our rhetoric, investments, our deployments toward any area outside of Asia, looking and raising questions about the sustainability of American commitment to Asia," said Denmark, currently with the Woodrow Wilson Center think-tank. 
		 CHINA, CHINA, CHINA? 
		 At the annual Shangri-La defense forum in Singapore later this week , Shanahan is expected to lay out his vision for the Asia-Pacific, with a particular focus on China, and what specifically the Pentagon is doing to implement its National Defense Strategy in the region. 
		 The closely watched speech will come at a time of tense relations between China and the United States, which are locked in a series of disputes, most notably a large-scale trade war and a jostling for military influence in the region. 
		 In just the past month, the United States has carried out two operations in the South China Sea and a transit through the strategic Taiwan Strait, moves that have angered China. 
		 A senior U.S. defense official said Shanahan's speech in Singapore would emphasize continuity in the American commitment to the region. 
		 "There's a lot of things that as a global power we have to be able to attend to. But this trip is about kind of showing and underscoring how our commitment (to Asia) is playing out," the official said. 
		 In his first trip to the region as acting defense secretary, Shanahan will also visit Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. The former Boeing Co. executive, whom President Donald Trump intends to nominate formally for defense secretary, is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart in Singapore. 
		 The Pentagon will also release a new report on U.S. military strategy for the region that will highlight areas where the United States is making investments and alliances in the region, the official said. 
		 "China can change the world... we can't afford to lose in Asia. Asia is the crown jewel," said Elbridge Colby, who led the Pentagon's development of the National Defense Strategy. 
		 "So we have to stay in the Middle East, but you've got to turn down the temperature and the demand signal," said Colby, currently with the Center for a New American Security. (Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Mary Milliken and Dan Grebler)

<texte>
		(Corrects day to Monday) 
		 PARIS, March 25 (Reuters) - Dubbed the "French Spiderman", Alain Robert scaled a skyscraper in Paris on Monday without a harness to raise funds for the renovation of Notre-Dame cathedral. 
		 Television images showed the 56-year-old using horizontal struts running up the Engie headquarters' curved facade and a protruding structure going top-to-bottom of <meronyme id="2091">the 185-metre (607 feet) glass-fronted building</meronyme> in <mention id="2092">La Defense business district</mention>
		Robert halted regularly to chalk his hands. 
		 He was arrested shortly after competing the climb. 
		 "Because there's no money left in the government coffers, the cathedral is falling into disrepair," he told Reuters ahead of the climb. His sponsors were writing a cheque of 5,000 euros ($5,650) to help finance the renovations, he added. 
		 During the stunt, bystanders at the bottom pointed smartphones towards clear blue skies as whispy clouds raced overheard in blustery winds. 
		 Robert has climbed more than 100 structures including the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Burj al Khalifa in Dubai, as well as the same tower in Paris in 2016. 
		 The Archbishop of Paris is on a drive to raise more than 100 million euros to save Notre-Dame's crumbling gargoyles and gothic arches.

<titre>TATA COMMUNICATIONS AND THALES JOIN FORCES TO ADDRESS BUSINESSES' DATA SECURITY CONCERNS AROUND IOT.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		ENPNewswire-July 12, 2019--TATA COMMUNICATIONS AND THALES JOIN FORCES TO ADDRESS BUSINESSES' DATA SECURITY CONCERNS AROUND IOT 
		 (C)2019 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 11072019 - Thales, a global leader in digital security, and Tata Communications, a leading global digital infrastructure provider, are working together to develop a secure global IoT connectivity solution. Tata Communications MOVE mobility and IoT platform and Thales's T-Sure warranted digital identity offering is set to unlock the value in data generated by connected devices such as cars and trucks, whilst maintaining the integrity and security of IoT data.
		In Tata Communications' global Cycle of Progress survey, 30% of IT decision makers cited security and 25% cited privacy issues as the biggest barriers to IoT adoption. The combined capabilities of Tata Communications and Thales aims to lower these barriers and enable businesses and manufacturers to make the most of the transformational potential of IoT by giving them peace of mind that their critical IoT data is protected against cyber-attacks. 
		 Thales will provide its T-sure warranted digital identity solution to Tata Communications MOVE SIM cards, based on technologies from Gemalto, a Thales company. While Tata Communications MOVE encrypts the data in motion (in current use), T-Sure protects the information at rest (archived) on the SIM, therefore safeguarding data both on the network and at the device level. The two companies look to undertake a series of proof-of-concepts with customers to test this solution in action. 
		 The need to protect IoT data is a major concern for the automotive industry, due to advancements in connected cars and autonomous vehicles coupled with the continued threat of cyber-attacks. The Thales and Tata Communications' solution aims to secure the data that vehicles carry and provide control over data and applications, whilst keeping hackers and cyber-criminals at bay. Reliable communications from vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) and from vehicle to vehicle (V2V) will help unlock the value in data generated by vehicles in applications such as driving pattern analytics, emergency services or preventive maintenance. 
		 Thus, the manufacturer will be able to gather data through the SIM to ensure a vehicle is operating safely, the dealership can use the SIM for keeping track of the maintenance logs, and the vehicle car owner can trust that his or her private information stays private. The solution aims to allow for multiple secure 'vaults' within the vehicle to which only the vault owner has access. This means that the manufacturer, dealership and vehicle owner will each have their own private, secure space to store information, run applications and establish communications, and the security of these vaults would be enabled and managed via the Tata Communications MOVE platform. 
		 The only thing that will allow IoT to fulfil its potential and bring about innovations like autonomous vehicles is totally trusted and secure data connectivity. The marriage of Tata Communications' expertise in the connected automotive sector with Thales's leadership position in IoT and data security, reinforced by the integration of Gemalto, is driving an offering that will give end users complete trust in the integrity of their data whilst opening up new business opportunities for manufacturers. 
		 Gareth Williams, Vice President, Secure Communications &amp; Information Systems, Thales 
		 IoT could transform how businesses operate and how people engage with one another and with every 'thing.' Protecting data against cyber-attacks both at the device and network level is crucial to accelerate IoT adoption worldwide. Tata Communications MOVE together with Thales's T-Sure solution aims to help businesses adopt IoT with confidence. It takes us closer to fulfilling our vision for a world where anything can be born connected - and born secure. 
		 Anthony Bartolo, Chief Product Officer, Tata Communications. 
		 Notes to editors 
		 The Tata Communications MOVE platform is part of the company's aim of creating truly borderless mobile experiences for people and things, and facilitating its customers and partners' growth in the global IoT market. It is underpinned by Tata Communications' global network, which today connects 4 out of 5 mobile subscribers and carries around 30% of the world's Internet routes. 
		 Thales's T-Sure is a warranted digital identity solution, which leverages the company's decades long experience in developing and delivering trusted systems in complex, safety-critical environments. 
		 Gemalto-Thales products are at the heart the Internet of Things. For more than two decades, they have been pioneering market-leading M2M and IoT products and services that keep customers on the leading edge of innovation.

<titre>FRANCE-SPIDERMAN/ (TV) At 55, 'French spiderman' keeps climbing world's skyscrapers</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		PARIS, March 14 (Reuters) - Alain Robert, sometimes known as the "French Spiderman" for climbing skyscrapers world worldwide, is still defying gravity at the age of 55. 
		 He scaled the summit of <meronyme id="2095">the fourth-tallest building</meronyme> in <mention id="2096">Paris' modern business district</mention> on Wednesday after evading security officers who had thwarted an earlier attempt.
		A hobby that started at 11 years old has taken Robert to more than 150 skyscrapers around the world, including Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, the Eiffel Tower, and the Sydney Opera House. 
		 "For me, climbing is a passion, it's a way of life," he said. 
		 It took Robert just over an hour to scale to the top of the 187-metre (614-feet) high Tour Total, which houses some of the offices of the French energy group of the same name. 
		 He has accomplished the feat twice in the past. 
		 Using only climbing shoes and chalk, he clung to the window ledges to lift himself up past the tower's 48 floors, cheered on by office workers-turned-spectators in <mention id="2097">La Defense</mention>. 
		 Robert had first tried to climb the Engie building on Wednesday morning, but security guards quickly came to remove him. 
		 He often climbs without permission and has been arrested several times. In 2008, he scaled the New York Times building to unfurl a banner on global warming, and was arrested by police. 
		 Robert sees no end in sight for his vertiginous adventures. 
		 "As long as I have the physical strength to scale heights, I will continue to climb," he said. (Reporting credits to Feyi Adegbite and Clotaire Achi; writing by Leigh Thomas)

<titre>CLIMATECHANGE-FRANCE/ (UPDATE 1, TV, PIX) UPDATE 1-Climate change protesters descend on France's SocGen, energy companies</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Adds comment from EDF, Total) 
		 PARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - Climate activists blocked thousands of employees from entering the headquarters of French bank Societe Generale, state-run utility EDF and oil giant Total on Friday, environmental group Greenpeace said. 
		 Greenpeace said it was protesting against company links to the oil and gas industry, which it calls a driving force in global warming. Activists also obstructed the entrance to the environment ministry near <mention id="2100">La Defense business district</mention>.
		Protesters plastered giant posters of President Emmanuel Macron carrying the slogan "Macron, President of Polluters" and a banner reading "Scene of Climate Crime" on the glass facade of Societe Generale, Reuters TV images showed. 
		 Police pepper-sprayed one group blocking the bank's main entrance in a sit-down protest. 
		 Some demonstrators taped themselves together while others cuffed themselves with plastic ties to metal poles to make it harder for police to dislodge them. 
		 Employees in business suits milled around outside their offices. "I just want to get inside and on with my work," one frustrated bank employee said. 
		 Greenpeace and action group Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) have previously criticized Societe Generale for its financial role in oil and gas projects, in particular the Rio Grande LNG gas project in the United States. 
		 A Societe Generale spokesman declined to comment. 
		 A spokesman for EDF, which relies heavily on nuclear and hydropower plants to generate electricity, said 96 percent of its power was carbon dioxide-free. He said EDF was committed to curbing its total carbon footprint by 40 percent by 2030. 
		 A Total spokeswoman said two senior company executives had held talks with representatives of Greenpeace and Les Amis de la Terre. 
		 Total chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told an industry summit on Friday his company had increased output to 2.95 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, passing its 2018 record, aided by increased production in Australia, Angola, Nigeria and Russia.

<titre>HSBC FRANCE-HEADQUARTERS/ (UPDATE 2, PIX) UPDATE 2-HSBC France to leave its Champs Elysees headquarters</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		(Recasts with company confirmation, adds HSBC France statement, other details) 
		 PARIS/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - HSBC France said on Wednesday its teams will leave a prestigious headquarters on Paris' Champs Elysees avenue by 2020 in an emblematic move ahead of the planned sale of its retail business in the country. 
		 The exit and planned sale, following a strategic review of the group's French retail activities, are part of a broader cost-cutting effort under interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.
		"HSBC France has a project of moving its headquarters by 2020 to 38 av Kleber, 500 meters away from its actual headquarters that was sold in 2010," the bank said in a statement. 
		 The building would be fit for 1,200 employees working mostly in corporate and investment banking and wealth management. 
		 Another 500 employees will be moved to <meronyme id="2101">HSBC's hub</meronyme> in <mention id="2102">La Defense business district</mention> which now houses 4,000 of the bank's employees and to branches close to the Champs Elysees building. 
		 HSBC France sold its headquarters at 103 avenue Champs Elysees, and a building in front of it at 15 rue Vernet, to Qatari investors and has rented them since then. 
		 The move is necessitated because the owner wants to regain control of the buildings and also because HSBC needs to save money, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
		 Office rents in Paris are rising to levels not seen since at least 2003, according to Immostat data, as vacancy rates are at record lows. 
		 HSBC inherited the historic headquarters when it bought the French retail operations of Crédit Commercial de France (CCF) in 2000. 
		 At the beginning of the 20th century, the building was a hotel where World War One spy and exotic dancer Mata Hari was arrested. 
		 HSBC Holdings has hired U.S. investment bank Lazard Ltd to sell its French retail business, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 
		 Quinn is expected to unveil the first details of his strategic overhaul of the bank when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 28. 
		 Quinn is auditioning for the full-time CEO job and insiders said he is under pressure to take decisive action after Chairman Mark Tucker indicated his predecessor John Flint had not moved quickly enough to turn around the lender's performance. 
		 Reuters first reported news of HSBC's planned exit earlier on Wednesday, citing sources.

<titre>FRANCE-NOTREDAME/RESTORATION (PIX, TV) Debate over future Notre-Dame spire fuels French divisions</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 By Caroline Pailliez and Luke Baker  
		 * 19th century spire collapsed in Notre-Dame blaze 
		 * President Macron open to a modernist new spire 
		 * Art historians, conservatives favour return to the old
		By Caroline Pailliez and Luke Baker 
		 REIMS, France/PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron might have hoped he was striking a note for modernity and openness in announcing an international competition to design a new spire for Notre-Dame cathedral, but he may have opened a can of worms instead. 
		 There was already debate about whether his goal of rebuilding the church by 2024, when Paris hosts the Olympic Games, was overly ambitious, but now he's unsettled those who would prefer to return the national symbol to just how it was. 
		 "Since the spire wasn't part of the original cathedral," the Elysee Palace said in a statement late on Wednesday, "the President of the Republic hopes there will be some reflection and a contemporary architectural gesture might be envisaged." 
		 Computer-generated pictures online included ideas for a soaring glass needle to replace the 91-metre (300 foot) spire, which was added to the cathedral in the mid-1800s, replacing a Medieval one that was removed in 1786. 
		 But that appears to be too much for many French, especially those with a traditional or Catholic bent. 
		 In an online survey conducted by conservative newspaper Le Figaro, more than 70 percent of the 35,000 people who responded said they opposed any contemporary style design. 
		 Francois-Xavier Bellamy, a 33-year-old philosopher who will head the right-of-centre Les Republicains party list in next month's European Parliament elections, said Macron's government lacked humility in suggesting a modernist rethink. 
		 "We are the inheritors of patrimony, it doesn't belong to us, and it's important therefore that we hand it on in the way that we received it," he told Reuters. 
		 "There are rules in France about protecting national heritage. The President of the Republic is not above the law. It's not up to him to decide to build a modern spire." 
		 PLUS CA CHANGE... 
		 While Bellamy is a conservative Catholic and might be expected to campaign for returning the 850-year-old Gothic masterpiece to exactly how it was before the fire, his views are shared by some architectural historians. 
		 Patrick Demouy, an emeritus professor of medieval history who specialises in the Notre-Dame de Reims cathedral, said it would be difficult to imagine something starkly different to the 19th century spire, even if its architect, Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, was himself quite inventive with his design. 
		 "Personally, I'm in favour of restoring it to how it was because that's the spire that has imposed itself on the collective memory," he told Reuters. "It would be hard to perceive (a contemporary spire) because we wouldn't really recognise it any longer as being Notre-Dame." 
		 Macron's culture minister, Franck Riester, said it was important the nation debated the issue and generated ideas. There is likely to be months if not years of discussion before a design -- contemporary or otherwise -- is fixed upon. 
		 "The masterpiece that Viollet-le-Duc left us is exceptional, but we must not dogmatically insist that we recreate an identical cathedral," he told BFM TV. "We must let the debate take place, see what ideas are presented, and then decide." 
		 Paris has a track-record of being experimental with its architecture, whether via buildings such as the Pompidou Centre, or the glass pyramid at the heart of the Louvre, which blends modernism with classical lines. 
		 Other constructions, such as the 210-metre Montparnasse tower or <meronyme id="2104">the vast empty square of the Arche de la Defense</meronyme>, have come in for more criticism, even if they have fans, too. 
		 For Jean-Michel Leniaud, an art historian at the National Institute of Art History, Notre-Dame is special because it is both a work of art and among the nation's greatest monuments, a source of unity for citizens in times of strife. 
		 "The restoration of Notre-Dame de Paris shouldn't be the opportunity for creative architects to show off their inventive spark," he told Reuters. "We should go back to the original, the spire of Viollet-le-Duc," he said. 
		 "The best way, the most consensual way to overcome this terrible disaster is to return it to the original state." (Additional reporting by Richard Lough and Michaela Cabrera in Paris; Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Toby Chopra)

<titre>VINCI-OUTLOOK/ (PIX) French 'yellow vest' protests put brakes on Vinci's traffic growth</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		 By Dominique Vidalon  
		 * Vinci sees flat traffic figures on its French motorways in 2018 
		 * Vinci says "yellow vest" crisis was "very challenging" 
		 * Vinci CEO keeps 2018 forecast of higher revenue, earnings
		By Dominique Vidalon 
		 PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Anti-government protests that have blocked some French highways stalled traffic growth on motorways run by Vinci last year, the company's chief executive said. 
		 Vinci, Europe's largest construction and concessions group, nevertheless kept its forecasts for higher sales and earnings in 2018 and predicted that the group would see another year of growth in 2019. 
		 Vinci reports annual earnings on Feb. 6. Besides its construction and motorways business, Vinci also runs airports and bought a majority stake in Britain's Gatwick in December. 
		 "The 'yellow vest' crisis was very challenging. Traffic lost in the last two months of the year wiped out the increase in traffic of the first 10 months," CEO Xavier Huillard said on Wednesday. 
		 He was speaking at a company presentation held on the site of the new headquarters tower Vinci is building for France's Saint Gobain in <mention id="2107">Paris' La Defense business district</mention>. 
		 The "yellow vests" -- named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists must have in their cars -- have blocked roads and roundabouts since the middle of November, sometimes occupying highway toll booths and setting a number on fire. 
		 The demonstrations began as a protest against fuel tax increases, but have morphed into a wider backlash against the economic policies of French President Emmanuel Macron. 
		 Vinci has said that vandalism since the start of the protests will cost it "several tens of millions" of euros, not including lost revenue, as the protesters have allowed thousands of motorists on to the highways for free. 
		 Vinci has dropped a plan to send invoices to motorists who drove through toll booths without paying and whose license plates were captured on cameras, following government criticism. 
		 From Feb. 1, French highway toll prices are expected to rise by 1.8 percent on average, after increasing by 1.55 percent in 2018. 
		 But with the protests continuing, the government has urged motorway operators to seek ways to cushion that planned hike in prices to help consumers struggling with low spending power. 
		 Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne met motorways operators on Monday to discuss possible plans such as offering frequent users a subscription at a discount. 
		 "We have made proposals to Elisabeth Borne. There will be a joint gesture from all motorway operators," said Huillard, adding that operators were set to meet the minister again later this week. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta/Keith Weir)

<titre>RUGBY-UNION-CHAMPIONS-RAC-TOU/REPORTREPORT Rugby-Fourteen-man Toulouse see off Racing in all-French thriller</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		PARIS, March 31 (Reuters) - Toulouse, reduced to 14 men midway through the opening half, bravely held off hosts Racing 92 to win 22-21 in an all-French thriller on Sunday and qualify for the Champions Cup semi-finals. 
		 Last year's runners-up Racing had the last possession after Camille Chat's late try had put them within one point of the four-time champions, but Toulouse managed to steal the ball and hold it until time ran down.
		"It was a huge blow but we kept our composure. We defended during the whole second half, we stuck together," said Toulouse scrumhalf Antoine Dupont, who scored two tries. 
		 Toulouse had another try through Maxime Medard as Zach Holmes, who picked up a red card in the 23rd minute, and Romain Ntamack slotted a conversion each with Thomas Ramos adding a penalty. 
		 Racing, with the best attack in the Top 14, scored two tries through Teddy Thomas and Chat's late effort with their other points coming from the boot of Maxime Machenaud. 
		 Top 14 leaders Toulouse will travel to defending champions Leinster, who survived a scare in a 21-18 win against Ulster on Saturday. 
		 At <meronyme id="2108">the Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme>, Holmes was sent off for a high tackle on Juan Imhoff, leaving his side a man short. 
		 Soon afterwards, however, Thomas was sin-binned and Toulouse took full advantage with both teams on equal terms for 10 minutes. 
		 The visitors were 10-7 down after Racing answered Dupont's early converted try with a Machenaud penalty and Thomas's converted try. 
		 But after Thomas was shown a yellow card for cynical play, Toulouse regained the lead when Medard touched down at the end of a brilliant collective move. 
		 Dupont scored his second try just before halftime as Ntamack's conversion put them 19-10 up. 
		 Racing came breathing down their opponents' necks with a couple of penalties, only for Ramos's three-pointer to give the visitors a five-point lead with 12 minutes left. 
		 Chat restored hope for the hosts, who played another 10 minutes with 14 men after Imhoff was sanctioned in the 66th, when he dived into the right corner even though Machenaud failed to convert. 
		 They had a Leone Nakarawa try disallowed for an earlier fault on a lineout and Toulouse's defence eventually helped the visitors rip the ball from the final possession and win a penalty as the clock turned red. (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris)

<titre>The Student Hotel Secures EUR82 Million in Green Financing for Toulouse and Paris; With Ground-Breaking Credit Agricole CIB ESG Loan.</titre>

<texte>
		ENPNewswire-November 15, 2019--The Student Hotel Secures EUR82 Million in Green Financing for Toulouse and Paris; With Ground-Breaking Credit Agricole CIB ESG Loan 
		 (C)2019 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 14112019 - The Student Hotel (TSH) has secured EUR82 million for its two new hotel projects in Paris and Toulouse through an innovative ESG financing structure from Credit Agricole CIB. The funding combines the characteristics of a green loan with a sustainability-linked loan, which the French bank is applying to a structured credit line for the first time in the European real estate investment industry.
		Under the terms of the green loan, TSH is targeting the international BREEAM 'Very Good' rating for both buildings. 
		 Lucas Rijckmans, Chief Corporate Services at TSH, said: 'The Student Hotel and Credit Agricole CIB have agreed a pioneering green financing package for our development and refurbishment projects in Paris and Toulouse. The terms of this combination green loan mirror the targets of our ambitious sustainability strategy that will overlay the entire European TSH portfolio, which is set to triple in size over the next five years.' 
		 French bank Credit Agricole CIB, which is acting as Arranger, Underwriter, Bookrunner and Agent, has coupled the green loan element of its financing package, which provides funding for TSH to improve the sustainability of its assets, with a 'sustainability linked margin' that sets ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) goals that, if achieved, result in interest rate cost savings. 
		 The Paris development accounts for 58% of the TSH financing package, and the Toulouse refurbishment for the remaining 42%. The Amsterdam-based operator, developer and investor plans to operate more than 4,000 hotel and extended-stay rooms in France by 2022. 
		 The new financing also forms part of a EUR2 billion accelerated pan-European investment programme by TSH that will increase the number of its hotels in operation across Europe from 13 to 38 over the next five years. 
		 Nathalie Sarel, Head of Sustainable Banking at Credit Agricole CIB, said: 'Green finance is playing a growing role in guiding companies towards integrating ESG elements in their operations. This is particularly important for the real estate sector, which is a major source of the CO2 emissions that contribute to global climate change. With this ground-breaking green financing structure, The Student Hotel is showing its commitment to developing green assets and incorporating ESG targets, and is making a big step forward to address its environmental and social challenges.' 
		 The Student Hotel could achieve a saving on the annual interest rate applied to the full EUR82 million green loan for every year TSH achieves the target ESG thresholds in the reduction of energy consumption, food waste production and social diversity of its workforce. These goals are divided 50/50 between the TSH Group level, for the aggregated pan-European portfolio, and the two French assets being financed. The ESG targets are: 
		 To improve TSH's overall Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) rating score at the Group level. 
		 The TSH Group has set a target that 2.5% of the company's workforce at all its locations should consist of people with 'a distance to the labour market'. It is rolling this programme out across European markets, including Toulouse and Paris when they become operational. 
		 For the Paris and Toulouse projects, TSH aims to meet, or undershoot, the Paris Climate Accord target that buildings should only consume 50 kWh/m2. 'Paris Proof' is therefore the gauge for TSH's green loan terms at the asset level. 
		 To reduce food waste and become smarter in food management by ensuring food leftovers that can still serve as a meal for someone are saved. The company wants to reduce food waste in its restaurants to 10% or less through partnering with initiatives such as 'Zero Food Waste,' the automated food waste monitor, and the European initiative 'Too Good to Go.' The first hotels in the Netherlands are starting with these programmes over 2019-2020 and the French market is expected to follow suit. 
		 The Student Hotel's sustainability ambitions extend to its hospitality operational business, where all products and services are being reviewed to consider whether there are eco-friendly alternatives available. For example, over the next year, TSH plans to do away with all single-use plastic items in its restaurants, and is introducing new biodegradable disposables for items such as coffee cups, pizza boxes and so on. 
		 Amber Westerborg, Impact Manager at TSH, said: 'TSH is committed to growing consciously and sustainably, and actively engages its students, guests, entrepreneurs and other tribes in the process. We believe that by doing so we can make the most positive impact. Our goal is to create innovative buildings and projects where individuals are transformed into a community of changemakers that will ultimately go out and change the world for good.' 
		 Paris and Toulouse Projects 
		 TSH entered the French market in 2015 with a pilot site in <mention id="2109">Paris La Defense</mention>. Its second hotel in the city, within the 19th district, is due to open in March 2022 and will comprise circa 300 rooms over 11,000 sqm incorporating the full TSH brand experience. The all-in cost of the project is put at around EUR65 million. 
		 Construction of the Toulouse hotel, which is located in the Compans Caffarelliarea in thecentre of the city on Place de l'Europe, and which will also incorporate the full TSH brand experience, began in September and is due to open in July 2021. TSH's total investment in the Toulouse project is in excess of EUR45 million, and will allow the extension and refurbishment of a former barracks into 12,000 sqm of student accommodation and hotel, with 354 high-profile rooms, design common areas and a rooftop with a pool and 360-degree views of the city. 
		 Finae Advisors acted as debt advisor to TSH. Paris-based law firm LPA-CGR avocats acted as legal advisor to TSH on the financing aspects.

		 (C)2019 ENPublishing - http://www.enpublishing.co.uk 
		 Release date- 29112019 - At the InnovDays 2019 event on 27, 28 and 29 November 2019 at <meronyme id="2111">the Grande Arche</meronyme> in <mention id="2112">the La Defense district of Paris</mention>, Thales will present a vast array of new technologies and solutions underpinning its ability to build a future we can all trust in the areas of aerospace, transport, defence and digital security.
		Working with partners in the academic research community, Thales will also invite visitors to take an immersive tour of Europe's top physics research unit* to show how quantum physics is pushing back the boundaries of sensor technologies and communication systems. 
		 In Toulouse, the Group will also present the brain of tomorrow's aircraft and show what flying will be like in the future - clean, comfortable and on time. 
		 Thales launched InnovDays in 2012 as a way for its customers and partners to gain exclusive insights into the technological excellence of its research facilities. Since then, successive InnovDays events have turned the spotlight on the latest technological innovations developed by more than 29,500 Thales engineers and researchers. 
		 InnovDays: building a trusted future through science 
		 InnovDays is a reflection of Thales's objective of leveraging science and high technology to build a future we can all trust. By harnessing the unprecedented precision and power of quantum physics and augmenting the performance of its systems thanks to artificial intelligence, Thales is developing the new generation of technologies that will shape the world of tomorrow. 
		 'InnovDays is an illustration of Thales's outstanding technological capabilities and the passion displayed by our 29,500 engineers for helping our customers step up to society's major challenges through innovation.' 
		 Marko Erman, Chief Technology Officer. 
		 As an expert in critical systems, Thales is conducting in-depth research into both digital technologies and deep tech solutions to develop a portfolio of products based on a common core of technological building blocks. At InnovDays on 27, 28 and 29 November 2019, Thales will present a total of 70 practical applications of this research centred around the following themes: 
		 Round tables: 
		 Thursday 28 November: 
		 8.30 am: How can we make AI trustable? 
		 1.30 pm: Sovereignty in the digital age 
		 Friday 29 November: 
		 8.30 am: High tech and climate change: friend or foe? 11.00 am: The strategy and the future of air transport 1.30 pm: The second quantum revolution starts now! Star guests from the world of science and industry will be taking part in these round table sessions, including Albert Fert (Nobel Prize in Physics 2007), Jean-Marc Jancovici (Founder and President of The Shift Project), Alexandre de Juniac (IATA Director General and CEO) and Pascale Senellart (research director at the Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Paris-Saclay University, Paris-Sud University, CNRS). 
		 Proposed press tours at InnovDays 2019 
		 Tomorrow's cities 
		 The future of transport 
		 Biometrics 
		 The Cloud 
		 Big Data 
		 Tomorrow's connectivity in the civil world 
		 Tomorrow's connectivity in the world of defence 
		 Air defence of the future 
		 Land and naval defence of the future 
		 The augmented soldier 
		 Secure identities and data for citizens and businesses 
		 On 27, 28 and 29 November 2019, the Thales YouTube channel will feature live coverage of the round table sessions and some of the most popular demonstrations. 
		 From sensors that are up to 10,000 more accurate to ultra-secure communications, quantum technologies are set to push back the boundaries of physics and unleash previously unexploited properties of matter. 
		 An aircraft flying from Paris to New York with only an inertial navigation system to guide it could determine its location to within a few kilometres. With future quantum sensors, it could land with a precision of within a metre. In other fields, quantum sensors could detect tumours that are invisible today, or provide a basis for developing new sources of energy. 
		 Quantum physics relies on radically new concepts and ways of manipulating matter. Quantum sensors, like quantum communications and quantum computing, are currently under the microscope in the laboratories operated by Thales and its academic partners (CNRS, Universite Paris-Saclay, etc.) at the Saclay research and technology cluster, south of Paris. 
		 On 26 November 2019, Thales and its academic and research partners are organising a presentation at Saclay to highlight European excellence in quantum research: from cold atoms to flawed diamonds and superconductors, scientific progress in quantum physics has the potential to harness unexploited properties of matter and unleash a whole host of new opportunities. 
		 Thales is working on these new properties to develop the next generation of quantum sensors, relying on the exact same technological building blocks as quantum computers. Quantum encryption too, could soon lead to communication systems that are completely secure and trustworthy. 
		 Thales has also been selected to take part in the European OPENQKD initiative as part of the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) consortium chosen by the European Commission to install infrastructure in several European countries to test quantum communication networks. 
		 Navigating intelligently among millions of aircraft movements: Thales presents the brain of tomorrow's aircraft. 
		 Ultimately, quantum technologies will provide untold benefits for avionics systems, including order-of-magnitude improvements in navigation precision. But the immediate truth is that solutions are needed now to deal with the growth in air traffic, which is expected to have doubled by 2030. 
		 This is the thinking behind PureFlyt, developed by Thales as the brain of tomorrow's aircraft, a fully connected cockpit that will significantly increase aircraft performance. 
		 PureFlyt will be unveiled in Toulouse on 25 November. One of the core innovations that makes PureFlyt a game-changer is its ability to draw on both onboard and open-world data, such as weather information, so that the aircraft trajectory can be permanently controlled, adapted and enhanced, resulting in optimised flight, decreased fuel consumption and a better flying experience for both passengers and crew.

<titre>Fairer funding models sought in attempt to keep rail costs on track  Transport Long-term value of big-ticket projects is being questioned, writes Patrick Mulholland</titre>
<auteur>Patrick Mulholland</auteur>
<texte>
		For two years of her undergraduate studies, Alice Best commuted to Sciences Po in Paris from her hometown of Chaville, near Versailles. The 15km trip took an hour by public transport, sometimes longer. "In the evening, if I missed the train because my class over-ran, I had to wait 30 minutes to catch the next one," she says. This was the first leg of a journey involving the Métro, the RER suburban railway and sometimes bus.
		Last year, Ms Best moved to the centre of Paris to be closer to work. However, plans are in place to improve public transport for Parisian commuters who are not so well located. Due to be completed in 2035, the Grand Paris Express is an ambitious rail project to improve connectivity. "The Big Eight", as Parisians call it, will loop across the French capital and sew together the banlieues, including neglected areas such as Saint-Denis and Clichy-sous-Bois in the north and east, to business districts such as <mention id="2115">La Défense</mention> in the west.  Such grand plans are not cheap. Between 2013 and 2018, the estimated cost has jumped €12bn to €38.5bn, according to Reuters. But new transit infrastructure can have transformative economic and social effects on a city, says Jean-Louis Missika, deputy mayor of Paris. "You need to measure [its] impact ... over a very long period of time to realise it is worth it," he says.
		Paris is not alone. Cities around the world are assessing the value of costly infrastructure projects and seeking fairer ways of funding them. Last year, the UK parliament's public accounts committee lambasted Crossrail, a commuter rail project in London, for an "unacceptably laissez-faire attitude to costs" after delays added £2.8bn to the £14.8bn construction bill.
		These projects are necessary, says Alex Williams, director of city planning at Transport for London (TfL), the capital's transport authority, as there is a limit to how much can be done with "sweating existing assets" and "improving signalling". What is needed is additional rail capacity, and Crossrail will boost London's rail capacity 10 per cent.
		New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority says that developments on the Long Island Railroad Main Line and East Side Access to Grand Central Terminal will add 45 per cent capacity. Meanwhile, four new stations in the Bronx and the Moynihan Terminal at Penn Station will link neighbourhoods such as Co-op City to Manhattan.
		The value of increased rail capacity in growing cities is the creation of so-called agglomeration economies: areas of concentrated economic activity where businesses are at their most productive, says Simon Jeffrey from the think-tank Centre for Cities. It is this phenomenon that generates healthy tax receipts for local and national governments.
		In China, where 3,000km of subway line is under construction and will be operational within the next five years, each kilometre translates to 58 jobs and a rise in house prices, says Mao Baohua, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University.
		These statistics primarily refer to Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, where land resources are scarce and commuter demand is high. "Some prefecture-level cities in the central and western regions, such as Baotou, Datong and Hengyang have yet to meet these conditions," says Prof Mao, "and therefore, they need to be cautious when it comes to building subway systems".
		Although high-density cities stand to benefit the most from new transit infrastructure, they are also more expensive and politically contentious to build in.
		The climbing value of property prices in proportion to their proximity to public transport is one aspect from which policymakers are looking to finance projects. Past extensions to London's Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway "produced significant land value uplifts", according to a study by KPMG and Savills, the estate agent. These projects have mostly been funded by government, prompting TfL's Mr Williams and others to call for landowners — who benefit from these investments — to shoulder more of their cost.
		For example, the $700m Northern Line extension to Battersea will be paid for through a 25-year enterprise zone centred on the Battersea Power Station, where rent payments will go towards defraying construction costs.
		"Crossrail was a cocktail of funding from government, borrowing and business," says Mr Williams. "From now on, every major project we do will require a similar model to get them over the line."
		Other methods include the Hong Kong "rail-plus-property" model that gives development rights to the MTR transit system, which profit-shares or retains partial ownership of any new adjacent property schemes.
		In New York City, the first phase of Hudson Yards, a private property development built over the MTA's train yard, opened near the extended No 7 subway line service to 34th Street last year. The project cost $2.4bn, but the transit authority has clawed back $1bn from completed transactions on some of the 60m square feet of office space and residential development.
		For Ms Best, better public transport is an incentive to move further out of Paris. "When I have children, maybe I will move back to the suburbs," she says. "One of my criteria is having reliable access to the city. Maybe in the future [the Grand Paris Express] will make it easier for me to do that."

<titre>Combine and conquer  European politicians and regulators are starting to encourage cross-border mergers to create lenders able to compete against the Americans. France's Société Générale wants to be at the forefront. By Stephen Morris and David Keohane</titre>
<auteur>Stephen Morris and David Keohane</auteur>
<texte>
		E ven by the high standards of the École Polytechnique in Paris, founded to educate the country's future business and engineering elite, the class of 1984 plays a remarkable role in European banking.
		The group contains Tidjane Thiam, Jean Pierre Mustier and Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, who run Credit Suisse, UniCredit and BNP Paribas, respectively. It also includes Frédéric Oudéa, the Société Générale boss who is Europe's longest-serving major bank chief executive.  Still friends, the men occasionally meet to play golf. "We were very bad, all of us," recalls Mr Oudéa about a round a few years ago at the La Baule Club on France's Atlantic coast. "I think our balls went in the water. It was a disaster, but it was for fun."
		Those friendships could turn out to play an important role as the European banking industry considers a new round of dealmaking to create regional champions to take on the American groups that dominate the industry.
		In the decade since the financial crisis, Europe's biggest banks have largely struggled. Ultra-low interest rates, tougher post-crisis rules and the resurgence of Wall Street have made it all but impossible to generate decent returns.
		For the most part, European banking executives have eschewed talk of large mergers, deterred by fragmented national laws, rules and the memory of the calamitous combination of RBS and ABN Amro at the height of the crisis.
		But the dam may be about to break.
		Troubled by the parlous state of the financial system, eurozone politicians and regulators have given the first signal in years they may soon dismantle the remaining barriers to cross-border M&amp;A and achieve a true banking union.
		While many of his rivals are still wary of deals, Mr Oudéa openly courts the idea. "At this moment, which might be the turning point for Europe, I want to be able to seize the opportunity," he said in an interview at one of SocGen's trio of mirrored towers in <mention id="2116">La Défense</mention>.
		"If this consolidation, which is a logical outcome of a completed banking union, happens, you will have very few combinations. Do not imagine a flurry of deals, but Société Générale should be part of it."
		For the Parisian lender, a merger with a continental rival would make a lot of sense, giving it the firepower to invest in new technology and push back against the supremacy of Wall Street in trading and capital markets.
		According to Jérôme Legras, managing partner and head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, European banking regulators have made it clear that "the best way to fight negative rates is mergers, the solution to unprofitable banks is consolidation, so how long can the French resist?" Cause for optimism Mr Oudéa's 11-and-a-half years in charge have been bruising. He has presided over a 59 per cent fall in the share price while enduring a succession of misconduct scandals and a deteriorating operating environment. SocGen has been on a particularly bad run of late, opening last year with a profit warning and making thousands more job cuts, which have sharpened existential questions about its strategy and size.
		While his bank has been punching below its weight for most of his term, Mr Oudéa — who in the 1990s worked for Nicolas Sarkozy in government — is in no mood to quit. "I was appointed CEO at 45. I'm now 56, which is usually the age when you are appointed. So, I'm in great shape, I sleep very well and I must say I'm perfectly fit," Mr Oudéa said, flexing his biceps for emphasis.
		Many obstacles remain to banking union. National regulations still differ on capital and liquidity, not to mention incompatible bankruptcy laws and treatment of mortgages.
		Yet after many false dawns, bankers finally had cause for optimism last month when a historically recalcitrant Germany dropped its opposition to a common deposit insurance scheme, perhaps the single biggest hindrance to cross-border deals. Mr Oudéa said he could see the remaining problems being solved within three years.
		The chief executive thinks that regulators, worried about "too big to fail" institutions, will prevent any bank from running a balance sheet of more than €3tn. But SocGen's more modest €1.4tn of assets gives it "a margin of manoeuvre ... a size which offers some flexibility".
		"The supervisor will be very, very prudent," he adds. "They will want to avoid a catastrophe like we had in RBS," referring to the £46bn taxpayer bailout of the UK lender after it bought ABN.
		Deal rumours have swirled around SocGen for years. In the summer, Mr Oudéa flirted with UniCredit, run by his former colleague Mr Mustier, who lost his job at SocGen over a rogue trading scandal. However, the deal never advanced because of the probable credit rating downgrade that would have followed a takeover by a riskier Italian bank, increasing funding costs and effectively killing the margins of the wholesale banking business, people familiar with the discussions told the Financial Times.
		After also having a look at Commerzbank last year, Mr Mustier has now sworn off deals — in public at least. "No M&amp;A," he told the FT in December. "How can I be more precise?" Undeterred, the top brass at SocGen believe there is support for a new European investment banking champion better able to vie with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, who have been steadily poaching business from the retrenching French, Germans and British.
		A wide gulf has opened up. JPMorgan's $436bn market capitalisation makes it six times more valuable than BNP Paribas and 16 times more than SocGen. In the first three months of last year, the US group made $9.2bn of net profit, more than any of continental Europe's biggest banks earned for the whole of 2018.
		"When I speak with clients they don't want to be in the hands of American banks and I think that the regulators will not want to have such a concentration of risk," Mr Oudéa says. SocGen's chairman, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an Italian former member of the ECB's executive board, echoes these concerns. "Not having a European bank committed to the euro is not desirable, politically or economically," he says. "The fact that Deutsche Bank is refocus-ing is a loss for Europe. The Germans are starting to realise this, after so many years they are realising that having somebody that is committed long term, not just in an opportunistic way, is important."
		This fear underpinned German finance minister Olaf Scholz's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to push together Deutsche and Commerzbank earlier this year. Mr Scholz has said publicly that having stable lenders is a question of "national sovereignty" — perhaps stung by the memory of how during the crisis, panicked foreign banks restricted the supply of credit and retreated to their home countries.
		"French investment banks with local roots and senior management bring a perspective that is valuable," says Ross McInnes, chairman of Safran, the French engine maker. "We need also to be mindful of American extraterritorial measures, in particular on legal and conformity requirements, and building alternatives to payment systems involving the US dollar requires strong, broadly-based European universal banks."
		'We don't run CEOs out of town' Cross-border deals could provide a partial way out of the slump the European industry has suffered. Europeans' average return on equity declined to 7 per cent last year, less than half the average 16 per cent generated by big American banks, according to data from the European Banking Authority and Citigroup.
		Other potential partners known to be looking for scale and synergies include Dutch lender ING, which had an interest in Commerzbank, while Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's UBS also discussed a tie-up at the same time.
		Before SocGen can ink any deal, however, it must get its house in order. In an unimpressive field it languishes near the bottom in most metrics and is worth 40 per cent of book value. Of the region's largest lenders, only Germany's troubled Deutsche and Commerzbank trade at a lower ratio. Similarly, its RoE has dropped to 6.1 per cent, a far cry from its 9 to 10 per cent target.
		The shares plunged after February's shock profit warning and drop in its vital core capital level, prompting a strategic review that resulted in 1,600 job cuts and €500m of cost savings at the struggling trading unit, once the group's main profit centre. "SocGen is now one of the cheapest banks in Europe," says JPMorgan analyst Delphine Lee.
		If the lender cannot get itself into shape, executives are concerned they risk either missing out and languishing as others combine and grow, or being snapped up and absorbed by a healthier rival.
		"To be an active player our valuation has to be much better," says Mr Bini Smaghi. "So we are working on this.
		And to be fit, prepared and flexible."
		Mr Oudéa retains a lot of personal credit from big shareholders, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Amundi and Capital Group, for steering the bank through various crises. First came the rogue trading scandal that led to Mr Oudéa's appointment, when Jérôme Kerviel lost the lender €4.9bn on bad bets on stock index futures.
		Then a series of legal cases hit — bribery in Libya, Libor manipulation and sanctions violations in countries including Cuba, Iran and Sudan — which led to leading succession candidate, Didier Valet, also being forced out.
		Few think Mr Oudéa's job is at risk, even if the board has accelerated succession planning for an eventual retirement, according to one person involved in the process. Net profit has doubled from the level when he took over in 2008 and shareholders voted to extend his contract for four more years in May.
		"This is France, Fred won't be chased out unless there's another huge screw-up," says a school friend of Mr Oudéa, who is now the chief executive of another European bank. "We don't run CEOs out of town here."
		The most recent quarterly results provided some relief as the bank's core CET1 capital recovered to 12.5 per cent. SocGen's other main divisions have also been more stable and profitable. International retail remains a selling point, while the domestic retail business has been generating an RoE of 11-12 per cent, among the best in France.
		William Kadouch-Chassaing, Soc-Gen's chief financial officer, says a year ago investors and executives had "conversations [that] were not very friendly" but that now "we don't have major pushback on our strategy".
		Core operations The immediate priority is to fix the investment bank. Traditionally known for hiring engineering and mathematics PhDs, SocGen is still ranked number one in Europe for exotic structured finance products, such as equity derivatives, where the returns on offer are comfortably in the double-digits.
		However, it has been suffering badly in stock and fixed-income trading, where margins and volumes are in decline. Remedial measures have included shrinking its hedge fund services team, shuttering its proprietary trading unit and cutting its cash equity trading operations.
		"We were the inventor of equity derivatives, and then we were the inventor of structured finance," Séverin Cabannes, one of SocGen's four deputy CEOs, says. "We must refocus on our core DNA; Société Générale is a bank of engineers, that is the core legitimacy we have."
		The other option would be more disposals. After selling its Balkans consumer network and its Scandinavian equipment finance and factoring business last year, market chatter suggests that Lyxor, SocGen's €150bn asset management arm, could be on the block. Whether SocGen continues to forge a path alone, partners up with peers or plays an active role in consolidation, the bank still has its fans — even among long-suffering investors. "Over the last 20 years SocGen has never lost money, even when going through two huge crises, so their business model is very resilient," says Davide Serra, founder of hedge fund Algebris, which owns the bank's debt and equity.
		"It is the most undervalued company in Europe and, for us, it is a core holding. I don't need a cross-border merger to make money. If they keep going the way they are then I am sure the shares will reprice."

<titre>Brexit vote stems flow of French bankers heading for London  Attitude shift</titre>
<auteur>By Michael Stothard in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		The flow of French financiers moving to London to escape the tax rises of the Socialist government has ground to a halt, thanks to the Brexit vote .
		Senior bankers say financial groups have put the brake on sending staff to London since Britain's vote to leave the EU over concerns about the future of the City of London as a financial centre.  This is a marked shift from 2012 when President François Hollande declared finance his "enemy" and proposed hitting the rich with a 75 per cent tax rate - the following year the number of people earning more than €100,000 a year in France moving abroad jumped 40 per cent, according to the government. This was an acceleration of a trend that led to 42,000 millionaires leaving France between 2000 and 2014, according to a report by New World Wealth.
		Many moved to London's South Kensington, sometimes referred to as Paris's 21st  arrondissement
		and home to the French Lycée school, to become part of the roughly 300,000 French people in the capital - an estimated third of whom work in finance.
		François Soulmagnon, director-general of Afep, the lobby group representing more than 100 of France's biggest companies, agreed the trend of bankers moving to London was now coming to an end. "The flow of bankers going to London has largely stopped," he said.
		Two of France's largest banks, BNP Paribas and Société Générale, say it is business as usual, with both waiting to see how the negotiations to leave play out. But a senior SocGen executive said that because of the uncertainty created by the vote, the bank is holding back from creating jobs in London, even if it is not moving people away from the UK capital just yet.
		"We've put planned internal transfers to London on hold," he said. "And when we're hiring, we opt for the non-London option whenever we can."
		A BNP Paribas executive said his bank was being equally cautious: "Officially there is no change in policy - but in practice we are not adding new jobs in London for the time being."
		There are growing fears that the City of London, which is home to some 250 foreign banks and the bulk of Europe's capital markets activity, will have its wings clipped when the UK does finally leave the EU. Many in Brussels want London, the dominant currency trading centre, to lose its right to clear deals denominated in euros. UK-based banks could also lose so-called passporting rights to operate across the EU.
		Some French bankers said that London also seems less attractive culturally, pointing to what they see as a more parochial attitude in the UK and the recent spate of anti-immigration hate-crime following the EU vote.
		Jérôme, a junior banker at a large French bank, said that following the Brexit vote he was no longer angling to be sent to London, saying he preferred Italy. He added: "London does not seem so cool any more."
		Indeed, the UK's vote has already helped Paris seem - relatively at least - more attractive to international banks.
		Laurence Harvey Wood, an employment lawyer at Freshfields in Paris, who works with US and European banks, said job cuts by non-French investment banks in Paris had slowed since the referendum as they reassessed their strategy.
		"Some restructuring projects in Paris are getting put on ice," he said. "Investment banks don't know exactly what will happen [over the terms of Britain's EU exit], so some prefer to wait and see how things stand in a year or two."
		French policymakers hope the end of the flow of bankers to London is a step towards a more momentous shift - financiers leaving London for Paris.
		Before the June 23 referendum, HSBC said it would move about 20 per cent of its London workforce - about 1,000 jobs - to Paris in the event of a Leave vote, saying jobs would go from the trading room and investment banking.
		Manuel Valls, French prime minister, has since announced improvements to the tax regime , including lower payments for expats moving to France: "We want to build the financial capital of the future . . . now's the time to come to France." Many, however, are sceptical about whether Paris can become a serious financial capital.
		Philippe Villin, a banker and adviser to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, said Paris "will never become a major financial centre" as long as the cost of employing staff and corporate and personal taxes are so "stupidly enormous".
		"Paris, compared to London, is not even as fun as it once was," Mr Villin added. "Nice restaurants are empty and the traffic has become terrible."

		"Tired of the fog? Try the frogs!" <mention id="2117">Paris's business district</mention> has unveiled an advertising campaign that embraces longstanding national clichés in the hope of luring London-based workers to the French capital.
		The advert, which features a large frog wearing a French tricolore tie sitting in front of <mention id="2118">La Défense</mention>'s skyscrapers, is the latest in measures aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote and attracting big financial groups to Paris. "Brexit is bad news for Europe but it's a fantastic opportunity for Paris and <mention id="2119">its business district</mention>," said Marie-Célie Guillaume, chief executive of Defacto La Défense, the body responsible for managing <mention id="2120">the finance hub in western Paris</mention>. "France is ready to welcome business and finance."
		<mention id="2121">La Défense</mention> is <mention id="2122">Europe's largest business district</mention>, home to 400 companies and 160,000 employees. It includes the likes of HSBC, Société Générale, EY, KPMG and Allianz.
		The lobbying effort highlights <mention id="2123">La Défense</mention>'s 3.5m sq metres of office space and strong transport links, as well as the wider cultural attraction of the French capital. The initial target is financial companies but it will also focus on the energy sector and start-up businesses.

<titre>EU border scandal: How did most wanted man get to Paris?  Difficult questions for security services as tests are expected to confirm massacre mastermind was killed in gun battle</titre>
<auteur>By Gordon Rayner, Henry Samuel in Paris and Steven Swinford</auteur>
<texte>
		FRENCH and Belgian security services were facing difficult questions last night as to how one of Europe's most wanted terrorists was able to slip back into France from Syria and mastermind the Paris attacks from a flat in the city.
		DNA tests are expected to confirm that Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the man named as the ringleader behind last week's massacre, was one of two Isil murderers killed in a fierce gun battle with police in Saint-Denis, little more than a mile from the area attacked on Friday. One of them was a female suicide bomber who blew herself up.  Abaaoud had assembled a second terrorist cell that was "ready to go" with a fresh wave of suicide attacks on Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, which is used by millions of Britons each year, and <mention id="2124">the La Defense financial district of the French capital</mention>.
		French police had believed that the 29-year-old Belgian was in Syria, where he had become one of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (Isil) most highprofile recruiters. Having been linked to a series of terrorist attacks in Europe over the past two years, he was one of Europe's most wanted men.
		But the investigation into the deaths of 129 people on Friday took a dramatic turn when fresh intelligence suggested he was holed up in an apartment block in Saint-Denis. It was stormed by antiterrorist officers yesterday who used 5,000 bullets in the fight that ensued.
		The ease with which Abaaoud appears to have been able to travel unnoticed from Syria back through Europe will increase fears that Isil terrorists are exploiting the continent's migrant crisis to travel along routes being used by refugees.
		In other developments: ? David Cameron became increasingly confident that he will secure enough support from Labour MPs to win a Commons vote on beginning RAF air strikes on Syria. One Cabinet minister said: "We are going to war."
		Isil appeared to have adopted a new strategy of fake bombs and hoax security threats to cause added disruption and confusion.
		The European Commission indicat-ed that it will resist any attempt by France to strengthen border security within the Schengen border-free zone.
		Isil is moving fighters out of its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa and into the Iraqi city of Mosul to avoid air strikes by the US-led coalition.
		Elite firearms officers are secretly patrolling London's streets in a new fleet of unmarked cars as part of heightened security precautions. ? Isil published a photograph of the bomb it said brought down a Russian airliner in Egypt, which was contained in a soft drink can.
		The hunt for other attackers involved in the Paris massacre remains a fastpaced investigation, with at least one key suspect still on the run despite the death of two terrorists and the arrest of eight others in Saint-Denis.
		Salah Abdeslam, who escaped to Belgium after allegedly taking part in the attacks with his older brother Ibrahim, who blew himself up, remains at large. Police believe he may be driving a Citroen Xsara with the numberplate AE-113-SY.
		The dawn raid on a flat in Saint-Denis eliminated a second cell that might have been hours away from attacking <mention id="2125">La Defense</mention> and Charles de Gaulle, the second busiest airport in Europe.
		François Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said: "A new team of terrorists was neutralised and all indications are that given their arms, their organisational structure and their determination, they were ready to act." A mobile phone thrown into a bin by one of the suicide bombers at the Bataclan concert hall yielded crucial leads that led police to the flat where a major assault began at 4.20am local time yesterday.
		It ended seven hours later, after France's first female suicide bomber, named by sources as Abaaoud's cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen, blew herself up.
		Last night a Jewish teacher was stabbed in the southern French port of Marseille by three people claiming to be Isil supporters. Police said his injuries were not life-threatening.

<auteur>By Gordon Rayner, Henry Samuel in Paris and Steven Swinford</auteur>
<texte>
		FRENCH and Belgian security services are facing difficult questions as to how one of Europe's most wanted terrorists was able to slip back into France from Syria and mastermind the Paris attacks from a flat in the city.
		DNA tests confirmed that Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the man named as the ringleader behind the Nov 13 massacre in which 130 people died, was killed in a fierce gun battle with police in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis last Wednesday.  Abaaoud's cousin, Hasna Aitboulahcen, was also killed in the dawn raid on an apartment block and a third body was found later. It was still being identified. Eight others were arrested.
		Abaaoud had assembled a second terrorist cell that was "ready to go" with a fresh wave of suicide attacks on Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, which is used by millions of Britons each year, and <mention id="2126">the La Defense financial district of the French capital</mention>. French police had believed that the 29-year-old Belgian was in Syria, where he had become one of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (Isil) most high-profile recruiters.
		Having been linked to a series of terrorist attacks in Europe over the past two years, he was one of Eu-rope's most wanted men. But the investigation into the Nov 13 Paris attacks took a dramatic turn when fresh intelligence suggested that Abaaoud was holed up in an apartment block in Saint-Denis.
		It was stormed by anti-terrorist officers last Wednesday and Abaaoud was killed.
		The ease with which Abaaoud appears to have been able to travel unnoticed from Syria back through Europe will increase fears that Isil terrorists are exploiting the migrant crisis to travel along routes used by refugees.
		The dawn raid eliminated a second cell that might have been hours away from attacking <mention id="2127">La Defense</mention> and Charles de Gaulle, the second busiest airport in Europe.
		François Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said: "All indications are that given their arms, their organisa-tional structure and their determination, they were ready to act."
		It was thought initially that Aitboulahcen had detonated a suicide vest during the siege in Saint-Denis but police later established that it was a man who blew himself up. His identity has not been con-firmed.
		Described as a "party girl" Aitboulahcen, 26, had dreamed of joining the army or the police to protect her country, childhood friends told The Telegraph. But she could not join up and she became homeless, her neighbour said.
		Karim, who lives on a housing estate notorious for drugs and violence in the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, said: "For a while, she wanted to become a soldier and serve France. But she couldn't join up and she became homeless. Then she fell in with a new crowd and her new cause became Syria."
		After Aitboulahcen's parents split up, she was placed with a foster family from the age of eight to 15. Her foster mother said Aitboulahcen had "applauded in front of the TV" as she watched coverage of the September 11 attacks.
		"At the beginning she was a kid like the others," she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But her behaviour quickly deteriorated.
		"I think the problems came from her home, from her monthly visits to her parents," said the foster mother, who cried when she saw television pictures of the woman she helped raise.

<titre>Pillow talk  Jade Conro rounds up this month's hottest new hotel openings</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		New York EDITION, New York
		 Ian Schrager's rebirth continues. The third opening in his Edition portfolio is near Madison Square Park in New York. The 273 rooms are inside the landmark Clocktower building, inspired by the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice and built in 1909 (it was the world's tallest building until 1913). Like the Miami and London outposts, interiors reflect the city in which it lives. In this case, it's "American Glamour", reminiscent of New York's turn-of-the-century private clubs - so expect a destination restaurant, billiards room, two bars and, as ever with Schrager, a grand, bustling lobby.
		For more New York hotels, see: telegraph.co.uk/newyork
		 St Regis Venice San Clemente Palace, Venice
		After last month's Istanbul opening comes the next St Regis: the San Clemente Palace in Venice. Occupying a private island in the heart of the lagoon, the property has had a storied past since its construction in the 12th century. It was once a monastery, a military outpost and a guest home for Venetian nobility. More contemporary features are to be found inside the hotel: namely a spa, outdoor swimming pool, 191 luxury rooms and butler service.

		 Meliá Paris <mention id="2128">La Défense</mention>, Paris, France
		 <meronyme id="2129">The new Meliá Paris</meronyme> is the first hotel to be built in <mention id="2130">La Défense district</mention> in 15 years. And it's impressive. Surrounded by glossy skyscrapers, the silver building has been designed in the shape of a sail by Vasconi Architects and Jean-Philippe Nuel, the designer behind the renovation of Paris's Piscine Molitor. The 19th-floor Skyline bar and terrace will be a hotspot, with panoramic views of the city.
		For more Paris hotels, see: telegraph.co.uk/parishotels
		 Jumeirah Bodrum Palace, Turkey
		 Nestled in the Zeytinlikahve Cove on the Bodrum Coast, the Jumeirah Bodrum Palace could be the Turquoise Coast's most lavish hotel. After a significant refurbishment (it was formerly the Golden Savoy), it now offers only suites and private villas, as well as a 100 swimming pools, eight restaurants and a spa based on a Turkish hammam. The most opulent villa, the Palace, has six bedrooms, eight marble bathrooms, an indoor and outdoor pool, butler service and its own cabana on a private pier.

		 Legoland Florida Resort, USA
		 Lego fans rejoice: May 15 will see the opening of the first Legoland resort in Florida, located within the Legoland theme park. The hotel has themed rooms, a colourful pool and fun activities: guests have the chance to meet Master Model Builders. It's just 45-minutes away from Orlando, should you want to roll Legoland and Disney World into one trip.

<titre>This French property firm could be a beneficiary if UK takes the 'hard Brexit' path  <mention id="2131">La Défense</mention>, one possible home for any banks forced to leave the City of London</titre>
<auteur>Richard Evans</auteur>
<texte>
		THE likelihood of a "hard Brexit" changes by the hour but the stock we feature today, a French property company, is well positioned to benefit if Britain does make a fullblooded break from the EU.
		 France has long hoped to lure to Paris those London-based firms that could be forced to relocate to an EU country next year if a future deal between Britain and the bloc prevents them from trading as they do at present.
		Such companies will need offices and some of the best in Paris are owned by Icade, one of France's largest property business.
		Its modern office buildings in <mention id="2132">La Défense</mention>, sometimes called <meronyme id="2133">the Canary Wharf of Paris</meronyme>, could be particularly appealing to firms forced to flee London.
		 Illingworth, comanager of the Mid Wynd investment trust, a listed fund tipped by Questor in March. "Clearly Paris is in pole position to take some of London's business if Brexit forces financial firms to relocate to the EU."
		A move could even save them money: Icade's annual rents at <mention id="2134">La Défense</mention> are about €480 per square metre, compared with about €850 in the City of London, he said.
		 Forty five per cent of the company's office space by market value is in <mention id="2135">La Défense</mention>, while another 11pc is elsewhere in Paris; in all, the portfolio is heavily biased towards the Île-de-France greater Paris area, although there are assets in central Lyon and Marseille.
		The firm also owns some business parks and healthcare properties such as private hospitals.
		It owns just two shopping centres, however, so investors "don't have to worry about retail exposure", the fund manager said. Overall, the portfolio is 92pc let, while 75pc of office space in development has been pre-let.
		Although "upwards only" rent reviews of the type common in Britain tend not to be found in France, some tenants are agreeing to rent rises when their contracts roll over. The combination of some expansion of the estate and rent rises will drive any future growth. Last year office rental income rose by 7.6pc and earnings by 8.3pc.
		As a real estate investment trust (Reit) Icade must pay out most of its earnings as dividends and the yield is a healthy 6pc, based on next year's expected payout. Illingworth said his analysis of the security of the firm's cash flows suggested that the dividend was secure. It should also support the share price, in view of the pitiful returns on French fixed-income investments at present - about 0.6pc a year, or a tenth of Icade's yield, on 10-year bonds issued by the French government, for example.
		Further reassurance comes from the fact that the state owns, via Caisse des Dépôts, its investment arm, a 40pc stake in Icade. Crédit Agricole, the bank, owns a further 18pc.
		Despite the attractive yield, Questor sees the stock as a way for readers to inject some capital preservation ballast into their portfolio, partly to protect against any Brexit-related disruption.
		In the event of a disorderly exit from the EU, assets denominated in overseas currencies can be expected to do well in sterling terms as a fall in the pound is highly likely. Unique physical assets of the kind that Icade owns, and revenues underpinned by long-term contracts, will also be at a premium. An influx of banks from London would, from the company's point of view, be the icing on the cake.
		Anyone tempted by the yield should be aware that a withholding tax of up to 30pc is likely to be deducted by the French authorities.
		Questor says: buy Ticker: EPA:ICAD Share price at close: €84.10 Update: Capita Shares in Capita gained 4.9pc to 169.1p last Thursday, when the outsourcing firm announced the sale of its parking management business for £235m in cash and the award of a new contract with the Department for Education worth £109m over six years. The share price has now slipped a little to 168.1p.
		Where does that leave our "hold" advice at 669p in October 2016? As we explained on May 30 this year, the answer is not straightforward, thanks to the recent rights issue. But following the formula laid out in that article, Questor calculates our current loss at 45.4pc. The shares seem to have turned a corner and should rise further as investors gradually regain trust in the firm and its management. Hold.
		Read Questor's rules of investment before you follow our tips: telegraph.co.uk/go/ questorrules; twitter.com/DTQUESTOR Key numbers ? Market value (Dec 2017): €6.3bn ? Turnover (Dec 2017): €1.7bn ?

<titre>Sephora chain sees the chic in bricks and mortar  LVMH unit lifts sales fourfold over eight years as it bucks trend with store renovations</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW AND HANNAH COPELAND — PARIS</auteur>
<texte>
		It is lunchtime in <mention id="2136">La Défense business district</mention> in Paris, and <meronyme id="2137">the Sephora store</meronyme> is full of shoppers browsing through its high-end make-up and beauty collections.
		One young woman is testing out lipstick colours on a virtual mirror; another completes a touchscreen questionnaire to find the perfume that best reflects her desires. She plumps for a bottle of Dior's J'Adore and takes it to the personalisation counter for engraving.  Like its stores in New York's Times Square and Dubai Mall in the Middle East, Sephora in <mention id="2138">La Défense</mention> has recently reopened after an extensive refurbishment. The investment reflects how bricks and mortar and experiential retail are vital to Sephora's growth. The LVMH-owned group, which stocks about 300 brands alongside its own label, has increased sales fourfold in the past eight years, fuelled by a booming beauty market.
		"A lot of people are scared of the retail apocalypse so they're not investing in stores, and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy," said chief executive Chris de Lapuente in an interview on the shop floor. "We're investing in our stores, taking our top 100 stores in the world and renovating them to the best possible standard."
		The global cosmetics market was worth $532bn in 2017 and is expected to grow more than 7 per cent a year to $806bn by 2023, according to Orbis Research.
		LVMH on Wednesday said that likefor-like sales at the selective retailing division that Sephora is part of rose 8 per cent to €7.1bn in the first six months of the year. Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimates that the beauty group accounts for about 60 per cent of the unit's sales, and has a profit margin of 12-13 per cent. Sephora is LVMH's second-largest brand by sales.
		Mr de Lapuente says one attraction of Sephora is that consumers "discover brands they can't find anywhere else", noting that about one-third of its offerings are exclusive to Sephora, and it acts as an incubator for up and coming or niche brands.
		Exclusivity might be with Huda, which began selling false eyelashes in Dubai and subsequently developed a collaboration with Sephora; pop star Rihanna's cosmetics brand Fenty, which is on track for €500m sales this year.; or an exclusive collaboration with Dior for the Dior Backstage range of make-up.
		Pointing to the beauty bar where customers can get a free makeover, Mr de Lapuente added: "Experiential retail is crucial to our success. Sephora is a place where people come for advice, they come to listen. We teach, inspire and play ... You're not going to get this online. Online you can do your research ... here you can come and experiment."
		Mr Fujimori agrees, saying Sephora "successfully combines experiential retail with a leading ecommerce presence, leveraging digital technology to enhance the shopping experience instore and online".
		The challenge now for Sephora is to stay ahead in a world where there are more make-up and beauty brands than ever and social media has lowered barriers to entry and boosted the speed to market. Meanwhile, Amazon last month announced the launch of its professional beauty stores, aimed at the mass market. "Amazon is just another one of the many choices out there," said Mr de Lapuente. "They have a strong ecommerce offering. They don't have stores. We love that consumers love to shop online and in-store." He says that customers who buy both onand offline tend to purchase three times more than those who buy using just one channel. Ecommerce represents an average of 20 per cent of sales in each country for Sephora, which uses influencers to build its community. "Amazon just forces us to raise our game."
		Mr de Lapuente, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, joined Sephora as chief executive in 2011. It has since launched in 14 new markets, including Mexico, Brazil and Malaysia and now has 2,600 stores in 35 countries, opening them at a rate of up to 150 a year.
		The priority, however, is Asia — "a fantastic opportunity" according to Mr de Lapuente — where sales are growing 20 per cent a year, and 30 per cent in China. Asia's younger consumers, its growing middle class and a high interest in prestige beauty are attractive, and this year Sephora will open stores in Hong Kong and South Korea. The region accounts for roughly 15 per cent of overall sales.
		Despite Sephora's increasingly international footprint, it is small or absent in some key markets. It re-entered Germany in 2017, and has no presence in the UK — having pulled out a few years ago — or Japan.
		"They're opportunities for one day," said Mr de Lapuente.
		The pressure is on to keep innovating.
		"Beauty is so fast-moving, you can't cruise," said Mr de Lapuente.
		He says innovation will come both from new products (citing untapped potential in haircare and wellness), and from the way brands reach consumers. He sees opportunities in areas such as voice-activated ordering through home assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, and social commerce through platforms such as China's WeChat.
		But despite such technological developments, for Mr de Lapuente, the store has a robust future.
		At <mention id="2139">La Défense</mention>, customers are returning to work with Sephora's distinctive striped bags modelled on the black-andwhite stripes of Italy's Siena Cathedral. "Is physical retail alive or dead?" mused Mr de Lapuente among the throng of shoppers. "It looks pretty alive to me. The store is where the magic happens."
		The market for cosmetics was $532bn in 2017 and is expected to grow 7% a year to $806bn by 2023

<titre>Without a clean break from the EU, Brexit will be meaningless  Letters to the Editor</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		SIR - Anton Muscatelli (Comment, October 17) believes the best Brexit deal would involve joining the arrangement between the European Economic Area and European Free Trade Association, and then negotiating from there.
		I await his next article on the incentive for the EU to negotiate. It would have everything it desires from us - free movement, budget contributions and compliance with EU regulations. Meanwhile, we would have nothing.  Surely a clean break, and the announcement that a free-trade agreement is available should the EU desire, will show where it really stands on free trade - and that the problem does not lie with Britain's attitude. John Westwood East Grinstead, West Sussex SIR - Listening to the various Brexit debates, it clear that one key question needs to be asked of the British people to clarify the referendum result: do we want the maximum possible access to EU markets for our goods, services and people at the expense of immigration controls, or is controlling legal immigration from the EU paramount? Of course the Government should enter into negotiations seeking both, but if we cannot have our cake and eat it, then the priorities of the electorate must be clear - and there should be no assumptions.
		What angers many Remain voters is not primarily the vote to leave the EU. It is the vociferous group of "hard Brexit" supporters who claim that, just because they know what they voted for, the rest of those who voted to leave must want exactly the same thing. Adrian Thomas Tadley, Hampshire SIR - Wrapping up the Canada-EU free-trade deal is proving to be a problem because Belgium's Wallonia region seems bent on disrupting the unanimous vote required from the 27-member EU.
		In the wake of Brexit, Canada, along with other nations outside the EU, should jump at the chance of dealing simply with us.
		Professor John Rucklidge Chalgrove, Oxfordshire SIR - If you subscribe to the "all publicity is good publicity" school of thought, then the Paris <mention id="2144">La Défense</mention> campaign to poach London's bankers is a success (report, October 18).
		However, the key question is whether the slogan - "Tired of the fog? Try the frogs" - will inspire anyone to move to Paris. The answer is non.
		First, London fog evaporated with the Clean Air Act of 1956, so it is no reason for British business executives to "Choose <mention id="2145">Paris La Défense</mention>".
		Secondly, there is a reason why London is considered France's sixth biggest city. President Hollande's socialist government, with tax rates of 75 per cent and inflexible employment laws, means no one in France wants to start a business or hire anyone. Michael Moszynski London SW1

<titre>Carrots and sticks burnish Parisian pitch as EU financial centre</titre>
<auteur>By Patrick Jenkins on Finance</auteur>
<texte>
		Milan's pitch to City of London institutions last week would have been comic if it wasn't so tragic. Bizarrely, the lobbying arm of Italy's financial centre chose to arrive for their charm offensive only days after the country's referendum on controversial constitutional reforms, which prime minister Matteo Renzi lost, plunging Italian politics - and its financial sector - into mayhem.
		If ever there was a chance of a big finance group shifting operations to Italy, now was not the time to press the case.  Other eurozone rivals, by contrast, have been upping their game. Paris, in particular, appears to have enjoyed a surge of interest. In recent weeks, several asset managers have said privately that they might well choose Paris over rival centres such as Dublin, Luxembourg or Frankfurt if Brexit ends up being "hard", and necessitates the establishment of a new EU hub.
		That is a U-turn from even a few months ago when City financiers were as dismissive of Paris's merits as they were of the tortured advertising slogan for <mention id="2146">its La Defense business district</mention> (" Tired of the fog ? Try the Frogs! Choose <mention id="2147">Paris La Defense</mention>").
		So what is new? The political sea change has been the most obvious factor. Ever since François Fillon triumphed last month to become the centre-right candidate for May's presidential election, the man who served as prime minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy from 2007 to 2012 has been feted as France's likely next president (assuming he is not toppled by National Front candidate Marine Le Pen).
		The current president, Socialist François Hollande, is not only disliked at home (his approval rating is just 4 per cent) but has long been regarded with suspicion in the City. His threat of a 75 per cent wealth tax, though never implemented, was enough to repel high-earning individuals and employers alike. Mr Fillon would be a breath of fresh air for business, with promises to raise working-hour limits and grant companies €40bn of tax breaks .
		At the same time, the Paris financial centre lobby has moved on from weather-based jibes. Already there are attractive personal tax breaks for returning French nationals and foreign labour - with up to half of pay exempt from income tax for five years. The current government is offering to extend that to eight years and make "inpatriation bonuses" tax-free - benefits that financiers believe a Fillon government would preserve and maybe even further enhance.
		Alongside the big carrots is a fairly sizeable stick - particularly for those asset managers who are professing a sudden fondness for all things French. The Paris lobby's pitch book contains an ominous page warning that UK-based asset managers who think their European business model is "Brexit-proof" may well be mistaken.
		The two main EU directives (Ucits and AIFMD) currently used by asset managers to sell cross-border allow funds to be administered from locations such as Dublin, Luxembourg and Paris, but with fund managers in London under so-called "delegation" rules. The pitch book warns that "the current permissive structure for EU funds may not last". The likely greater use of delegation rules by UK funds post-Brexit "may become a great concern for European regulators", such as (Paris-based) securities watchdog Esma.
		No wonder there is chatter that the likes of Fidelity are considering shifting large chunks of their workforce to another EU financial centre such as Paris. France's Amundi, Europe's biggest listed fund manager, is doing its bit for the cause. It now has €1.3tn of assets under management, making it the world's number eight, after striking a deal yesterday to acquire Italy's Pioneer for €3.5bn.
		Most bankers are probably less enamoured of Paris. HSBC might be the exception. It warned in February that in the event of Brexit it could move 1,000 staff from London to Paris, where it owns CCF. Now the drip-drip seems to have begun. The group has not announced any mass migration, and will hold off from anything dramatic at least until Brexit negotiations progress. But insiders report that certain investment banking roles, particularly those held by French nationals, have begun to move from London to Paris.
		The draw for HSBC is not just the natural efficiency of having a ready-made subsidiary operation in the city. If the rumour mill is right, Henri de Castries - current board member and one-time favourite to succeed Douglas Flint as chairman - will soon be France's finance minister.

<titre>Saint-Gobain chief defiant after failed takeover  One of France's oldest groups has dismissed criticism from analysts and investors as questions mount on performanceDigital evolution Group steeped in tradition embraces technologyTimelineThree centuries of history for manufacturer founded to protect French interests</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE — PARIS , SARAH GORDON — LONDON</auteur>
<texte>
		The chief executive of one of France's oldest industrial companies is in no mood for criticism.
		"Honestly, this is bullshit," Pierre-André de Chalendar, the boss of Saint-Gobain, told the Financial Times in response to accusations that the company was too complex. While "it would be foolish for me to say we are perfect", those who criticise are "sometimes people who have uneducated views".  Mr de Chalendar is understandably defensive. He has just come through a failed takeover attempt of Swiss chemical group Sika that highlighted what critics describe as years of underperformance, poor investment decisions and top-heavy bureaucracy.
		The discontent comes as President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to shake up outmoded practices at some of France's largest companies.
		Established by French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1665 to counter Venetian glass imports, Saint-Gobain made the mirrors at Versailles. The company still makes glass, but it also makes and distributes building and construction materials, and prides itself on embracing technology. It employs 180,000 people worldwide and in 2017 pulled in €40bn in sales.
		The tussle over Sika focused investors' minds on Saint-Gobain's hunger for acquisitions, its balance sheet, profitability and management. Its share price has fallen 20 per cent over the past year.
		Mr de Chalendar is now trying to draw a line under his pursuit of Sika, which began in 2014 and ended without Saint-Gobain taking control but booking a large capital gain.
		The French company had tried to takeover Sika by buying 52 per cent of the voting rights but only 16 per cent of the shares from the controlling Burkard family. But the deal became bogged down in the courts, with investors such as the Bill &amp;Melinda Gates Foundation complaining it flouted corporate governance norms and disadvantaged minority shareholders.
		The legal stand-off was finally resolved last month, with Saint-Gobain taking a nearly 11 per cent share of Sika but accepting six years of standstill agreements before it can increase its stake past 12.9 per cent.
		Sika secured its independence and paid Saint-Gobain a premium to retire the outsized voting rights, while allowing the Burkards to exit the company. All parties were left with pride intact.
		"I think it's a good deal for everybody," said Mr de Chalendar. "In the end, it's a good compromise," Urs Burkard, who represented the Burkard family, told the FT, adding that Saint-Gobain "played fairly and honestly from day one".
		Operating margins at Saint-Gobain's three core businesses of building distribution, innovative materials and construction products are all below their recent peaks, however. And the rating agency S&amp;P said the company's profitability ratios were lower than those of its rated peers because of the low margins of its distribution business.
		Felix Brunotte, an analyst at independent research house AlphaValue, argued in March that Saint-Gobain was simultaneously "too centralised and too de-centralised".
		"For me, it's like a government with many layers of management," he said. "It's very complicated to do [any] change in the organisation."
		Mr Brunotte believes Saint-Gobain relies too much on acquisitions to fuel top-line growth — the company estimates it has made about 1,000 over its long history, including 60 over the past two years. The company has also pursued an aggressive share buyback programme in recent years, a strategy that can suggest organic growth opportunities may be lacking.
		Mr Brunotte argued Saint-Gobain's pension fund was underfunded, its asbestos liabilities were potentially open-ended, and its much-vaunted innovations were not delivering.
		He also said Saint-Gobain's return on capital employed — a measure of the efficiency of its investment — was below its cost of capital, measured by its weighted average cost of capital, WACC. This suggests that the company was not employing its capital effectively or creating value for shareholders. Christopher Rossbach, an investor in Sika at J. Stern &amp;Co, was also critical. He said companies such as Nestlé, Diageo and LVMH have "strong competitive positions in good and growing businesses, good managements, strong balance sheets and proven track records of generating long-term value. Saint-Gobain has none of that."
		Mr de Chalendar refused to accept the criticisms and insisted Saint-Gobain's breadth, built through acquisitions, was one of its great strengths. He dismissed Mr Brunotte's views as "nonsense".
		Saint-Gobain's chief financial officer, Guillaume Texier, added that the company's return on capital employed was 11.2 per cent in 2017, below its recent peak of 12.1 per cent in 2008, but beating its WACC of "approximately" 9.7 per cent.
		Regarding acquisitions, Mr de Chalendar said valuations were high and he was "going to stay very disciplined".
		Overall, criticism comes back to the central question of whether Saint-Gobain needs to modernise more quickly. This is even more important in light of Mr Macron's desire to drag corporate France into the 21st century by forcing companies to adapt and update.
		It is not the first time that Saint-Gobain has come under pressure to change. Ten years ago, Wendel, a storied French investment house, tried and failed to shake up Saint-Gobain when it built a 20 per cent stake.
		Mr de Chalendar argued that adjustments that might have looked easy to make, from the perspective of someone outside the company, were in reality more challenging to achieve. But some investors suggest Wendel simply underestimated the cultural barriers to change within Saint-Gobain.
		One senior banker in Paris, who has followed the company closely, said Saint-Gobain was "conscious of what history means and they ... won't break their business just to create short-term shareholder value".
		Mr de Chalendar himself said that, although the company has had to make radical alterations over its long history, his "vision of Saint-Gobain has not changed basically" since he took over.
		Saint-Gobain certainly does not feel like a company on the defensive. It moves into <meronyme id="2150">new, glossier headquarters</meronyme> in <mention id="2151">La Défense business district</mention> next year. Mr de Chalendar, meanwhile, said he would like his legacy to show he had "transformed the culture of Saint-Gobain from being manufacturingdriven to customer-driven".
		He was also not alone in his confidence that the questions being asked about the company's performance will eventually lose resonance.
		As another senior banker in Paris, who knows the company well, said: "Saint-Gobain has survived revolutions — it will survive this too."
		Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Zurich Saint-Gobain prides itself on its embrace of modern technology despite its 350 years of history. Its factories, churning out products from insulation through to smart-glass, are increasingly automated and boss Pierre-André de Chalendar spoke with great force about the company's digital evolution.
		He argued that soon middlemen in the construction industry would be needed less and customers would have increasing control over the products that made up their homes. That was an opportunity that demanded a technological push and a strengthening of Saint-Gobain brands.
		But although his company goes to great pains to demonstrate its modern edge, it remains conscious of its long history — something Saint-Gobain's in-house historian is there to help with.
		On the north-eastern edge of Paris, Saint-Gobain has turned a 150-yearold warehouse into a showcase of its latest innovations in materials and technology. But even there it has a wall dedicated to its centuries of history with snapshots of landmarks leading the way into the building.
		Traces of its history can also still be seen throughout France and its capital. <meronyme id="2152">The imposing Grande Arche</meronyme> at <mention id="2153">La Défense</mention>, the Grand Palais, the Pyramid at the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower in central Paris can all thank Saint-Gobain for their glass façades, floors and ceilings.
		However, one of the company's most dramatic claims was preventing the assassination of a French prime minister. Georges Clemenceau's life was saved after a Saint-Gobain windscreen stopped a bullet meant for him in 1919.

<titre>Paris ringleader went back to concert hall on Metro</titre>
<auteur>By Henry Samuel in Paris and Matthew Holehouse in Brussels</auteur>
<texte>
		THE suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks returned to the Bataclan concert venue while a police operation to kill the remaining gunmen was still underway, the Paris prosecutor revealed yesterday.
		Telephone analysis shows that Abdelhamid Abaaoud had returned to the area around the scene - where 90 people were killed by three assailants - while police were still attempting to free hostages on November 13.  This means that he was in the vicinity within minutes of President François Hollande, who insisted on showing up to offer support to victims and police shortly after the terrorists were killed. The Isil terrorist also visited the scene where minutes earlier he and at least two other terrorists opened fire on Parisians in cafes and restaurants in the 10th and 11th arrondissements.
		François Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said that Abaaoud had boarded a Metro going back to the centre of Paris and the phone he was believed to be using was detected in the 10th, 11th and 12th districts, and by the Bataclan concert hall while attacks were ongoing. "He revisited the area while the BRI (elite police unit) was still on the scene," he said.
		Abaaoud was among three people who died during a police raid on a flat in Saint-Denis in the days after the attacks.
		One of the three has still not been identified but is believed to have died when a suicide vest exploded.
		Investigators are convinced Abaaoud and the unidentified man were planning a suicide attack on <mention id="2154">the French capital's La Defense business district</mention> on Nov 18 or 19, Mr Molins added.
		Meanwhile, the hunt continued for suspect Salah Abdeslam, who fled to Belgium after apparently jettisoning his suicide vest. Belgian authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Mohamed Abrini, 30, a "dangerous" man seen driving a car with Abdeslam two days before the atrocities.
		In Washington, France and America pledged to "intensify airstrikes" against Isil in Syria and Iraq and "widen their scope" as President Barack Obama declared: "Nous sommes tous Français" in the wake of the Paris attacks.
		However, Mr Hollande ruled out sending French ground forces. Both called on Bashar al Assad's departure as part of a political solution to the Syrian crisis but neither would put a time frame on this, with Mr Hollande merely saying "as soon as possible".

<titre>Red, white and blue... the Briton transforming a top French vineyard  Lord Foster has been called in to breathe new life into one of France's best Bordeaux houses</titre>
<auteur>By Henry Samuel in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		THEY have both won the Pritzker prize, considered the Nobel for architects, and have vied to make their mark with some of the world's greatest building designs of the modern age. Now Lord Norman Foster, Britain's greatest living architect, has entered a prize fight with his biggest French rival, Jean Nouvel, to modernise two Bordeaux wine chateaux almost within spitting distance of one another.
		In a bold move in a region once run by the English for 300 years, Lord Foster, the man behind London's Gherkin tower and the Millennium Bridge, has just completed a new winery for Château Margaux - a legendary Bordeaux wine house dubbed "The Versailles of Médoc" due to its palatial design.  Château Margaux produces some of the most expensive wines in the world. A limited edition 12-litre bottle from 2009 recently sold in Dubai for €173,255 (£130,000). The Foster winery was used for the first time in this year's harvest, which ended this week. He also built an underground wine library to house 200,000 bottles.
		Mr Nouvel, meanwhile, recently completed a new wine cellar for the Château La Dominique winery in Saint-Émilion. He was also tasked with building a new fermenting room, as well as tourist facilities including wine-tasting rooms and a restaurant.
		The pair have competed on a string of huge projects. The Frenchman beat Lord Foster in a tender for a skyscraper in <mention id="2155">Paris's La Défense</mention> to rival the Eiffel Tower in 2008. However, the 990ft Signal Tower was subsequently scrapped. Mr Nouvel was also chosen to build Paris's recently completed Philharmonie concert hall, which he later disowned, saying his design had been trashed.
		Lord Foster scored a huge architectural triumph on French turf by building the Millau viaduct, the world's highest road bridge and the tallest structure in France, over the Tarn river in southwestern France. More recently, he renovated the quaysides of Marseille's old port.
		At Château Margaux, Lord Foster built a winery to house vats for the production of both red and white wine - the first new building on the site for 200 years.
		Asked why she chose a Briton over a great French architect, Corinne Mentzelopoulos, 62, Château Margaux's owner, told The Telegraph: "The English have been drinking our claret since Richard the Lionheart. France won Aquitaine back in 1453 (the end of the Hundred Years War), and London has loved our wines ever since, so it makes a lot of sense."
		Besides, she added, the region had "tried all the top French architects and I thought an Englishman would bring something new to Bordeaux, maybe a new way of looking at things". That said, she admitted to having "misgivings" about making changes but that the "bet paid off totally".
		The two designs could not be more different. While Lord Foster's blends in with the surrounding architecture with its tiled roof, tree-shaped loadbearing columns and light wells, the Nouvel design is bright red metal, deliberately standing out like a sore thumb against the vineyards of the Unesco World Heritage site. Mrs Mentzelopoulos said: "The fact that Lord Foster accepted to put his genius at the service of Margaux and not the opposite is extraordinary for an architect of such importance. I'm not sure others could do it."
		The designs are among a string of modern additions to Bordeaux's most prestigious chateaux by creative heavyweights in recent years, as the wine region booms.
		The first was Saint-Emilion's legendary Cheval Blanc, where billionaire owners Bernard Arnault and Albert Frère used Christian de Portzamparc, an award-winning architect, to design the winery in 2011.

<titre>Police fired 5,000 bullets in shootout at terrorists' lair  Raid on plotters' fortress Mobile phone of Bataclan attacker found in bin led officers to flat and plans for another atrocity Terror threat</titre>
<auteur>By Gordon Rayner, David Chazan, Henry Samuel and David Barrett in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		FRENCH police fired 5,000 bullets during a ferocious seven-hour killor-capture operation in which the ringleader of the Paris attacks is believed to have been shot dead.
		A dawn raid on an apartment block in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis was so violent that police must wait for the results of DNA tests to identify the remains of two terrorists who were killed. The Washington Post claims that two intelligence sources have confirmed one of the dead is Abdelhamid Abaaoud.  Until Tuesday, the French security services assumed the only way to neutralise Abaaoud was through air strikes on Raqqa, because he was believed to be in Syria, where he had become one of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (Isil) most high-profile recruiters.
		But then the investigation into the murders of 129 people on Friday took an astonishing turn: witness accounts and information found on a discarded mobile telephone suggested Abaaoud was not in Syria, but had all along been holed up in an apartment in Saint-Denis, just a few minutes away from the Stade de France.
		Worse still, it appeared he was controlling another terrorist cell preparing for a fresh wave of attacks on Paris.
		A vital new lead came from a mobile phone thrown into a bin by one of the terrorists who attacked the Bataclan concert hall on Friday. The last text message sent from it, at 9.42pm, just as the assault on the Bataclan was starting, said: "Off we go, here we go again." Analysis of the phone's content and a tip-off from a witness suggested that Abaaoud was in Saint-Denis. A female cousin of Abaaoud, Hasna Aitboulahcen, was placed under surveillance on Tuesday, and at 4.16am local time yesterday (3.16GMT), police moved in with lethal force to the building where she and Abaaoud were believed to be hiding.
		Officers from the elite Raid anti-terrorism unit - many of whom had been in action on Friday - moved into the apartment block in Rue du Corbillon, hoping to blast their way into the suspects' third-floor flat and capture them before they could react.
		But their way was barred by a reinforced door which held out against the explosive charges placed against it. What had been planned as a lightning raid was about to turn into one of the fiercest gun battles on French soil in decades.
		Jean-Michel Fauvergue, head of the Raid police unit, told Le Parisien: "The door held, and we lost our element of surprise. As a result we had to adapt. We started slowly advancing behind a shield. We came under heavy fire from true professionals. They fired in bursts or one shot at a time, taking turns so that the gunfire never stopped. That allowed them to save on their munitions. "They also threw grenades. They were incredibly driven. This first phase lasted 45 minutes. At around 4.45am three people came out on to the landing and gave themselves up. They were handcuffed and evacuated."
		The sound of automatic gunfire woke local residents. "It's as if war has come to our neighbourhood," said Mohamed Diallo, 22. "It's like a siege. People haven't gone to work and everyone is keeping the children at home." François Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said: "Very heavy, almost uninterrupted gunfire ensued. On the police side we fired almost 5,000 munitions."
		At 5am, after a lull in the shooting, the police sent in Diesel, a German shepherd attack dog, which was shot dead by the jihadis.
		As police went from house to house shouting "evacuate, evacuate!" a sniper positioned opposite the apartment saw a terrorist at a window and told him to raise his hands. He refused, and was shot by the sniper, but kept on firing a Kalashnikov.
		Then Aitboulahcen appeared at a window, shouting "help me, help me", perhaps to lure the police in. She was told that if she did not stay where she was, she would be shot, but went back inside.
		At around 6am, police began a fresh assault. Their targets were ready for them, wearing their suicide vests. Aitboulahcen was the first to open fire during the fresh exchange.
		The police tried to talk to Aitboulahcen, asking her: "Where's your boyfriend?" "He's not my boyfriend!" she screamed in reply.
		Seconds later, she detonated a suicide vest, killing herself and causing the floor of the apartment partly to collapse. The explosion was so violent that her spine was later found lying in the street outside.
		Police threw in 20 grenades and a second terrorist, believed to be Abaaoud, was killed in the battle that ensued, after being "riddled with bullets".
		Unsure how many more terrorists were in the building, the police fell back, and for the next three hours Saint-Denis was the location of a siege.
		A drone was sent up to look in through the windows and a skylight, but could not provide a clear picture of what was inside. Then two different robots equipped with cameras, similar to those used in bomb disposal, were sent into the building but their path was blocked by rubble.
		At around 7.30am local time, a series of explosions signalled the start of another assault by the police, now numbering 110 specialist officers.
		Five or six explosions were heard, followed by a 90-second pause, then another half dozen blasts.
		After another period without any gunfire, the police went into a flat below the terrorists' hideout and inserted cameras on sticks through large holes in the partially collapsed ceiling.
		Mr Fauvergue said: "We saw that a body had fallen through the floor. The corpse was damaged as it had been hit by grenades and had been crushed by a beam. It was not identifiable."
		They advanced to the third floor and found two men hiding in a pile of laundry and debris, and managed to take them alive. One of those arrested was brought out naked from the waist down, suggesting he had been ordered to strip off by officers to prove he was not wearing a suicide belt. Inside the flat was a wealth of evidence that showed another terrorist attack had been foiled. Weapons, explosives, suicide vests and plans were among the items seized.
		With no time to lose, police began questioning the three men arrested in the flat, to establish what they had planned and whether other suspects were still at large. They had reportedly been planning a fresh wave of attacks against <mention id="2156">La Defense</mention>, <mention id="2157">the financial district of Paris</mention>, and Charles de Gaulle airport, Europe's second busiest.
		Mr Molins said: "Everything leads us to believe that given their weaponry and level of preparation, they were ready to act."
		Jawad Bendaoud, the owner of the flat, was arrested as he was speaking to reporters. He said: "A friend asked me to let the house to his mates for a couple of days. I was asked to help people out. I had no idea who they were."
		His friend told him the men were coming from Belgium and needed a place to stay for a couple of days. "I told them there were no mattresses and they said, 'That's OK,' they just wanted water and a place to pray," he said.
		A friend of Mr Bendaoud - who was sentenced to eight years in prison for killing his best friend in a fight in 2006 - said she had slept in the apartment and it was a "sort of squat". Another man and a woman were arrested nearby, bringing the total arrests to eight. Just after 11.30am local time, police confirmed that the operation was over. The apartment building was so badly damaged that it had to be shored up before forensic teams could move in.
		Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, paid tribute to the police who have "never before come under such gunfire". Five officers were injured.
		François Hollande, the French president, described the raid as "a particularly perilous and heavy police operation", and paid tribute to police who "knew the dangers, yet no doubt still underestimated the violence that they would come up against".

<titre>Big data killed the wealth management star  COMMENT</titre>
<auteur>By Yuri Bender</auteur>
<texte>
		More than 35 years ago, The Buggles, a British band, recorded "Video killed the radio star". The song heralded the onset of an optimistic era of automation, while lamenting some of its side-effects.
		Today, in the new-age technology hubs serving the financial centres of London, Paris and Amsterdam, those concerns are gaining ground.  In the twin towers of Société Générale, sprouting out of <mention id="2158">the purpose-built Parisian business district of La Défense</mention>, private-banking boss Jean-Francois Mazaud describes his "test and learn" approach that was kick-started in the bank's "innovation lab" five years ago.
		Idealistic graduates from French business schools, who once would have been busy constructing ill-fated derivative-based structured products, are turning their hand to financial technology, apparently "part of the group's DNA".
		The old Buggles nightmare of a system that "can't rewind" is played down by Mr Mazaud, in favour of equilibrium between man and machine. A human-based wealth management offer should allow clients to set their own cursor to regulate time spent with their adviser.
		The issues jangling the nerves of French financiers are shared by the pragmatic bankers of the bleak Dutch hinterland in Amsterdam-Zuid, home to ABN Amro, the country's leading wealth manager.
		All of them have visited Asia and seen how far banks there are ahead of the technology curve. Most foreign competitors are watching DBS , one of Singapore's leading providers, closely. It is introducing a predictive system from IBM, the technology company, allowing staff to monitor vast reams of data and assist asset-allocation decisions for clients.
		This has been influenced, in turn, both by tech-savvy Korean banks and Chinese groups such as Alibaba , the ecommerce group, and Tencent , the gaming and messaging company.
		The question for private bankers is how far they can afford to go into this battle with data? Publicly most will say they will do whatever it takes, even if they have private reservations. " Big data are not just a big dream," says Jeroen Rijpkema, chief executive of international private banking at ABN Amro.
		This obsession with data delivery and robotic channels of communication has its dangers. Indeed, many of the existing private banking problems of poor asset allocation and the sale of incorrect products are not really solved, but exacerbated.
		Blind digitisation will not help heal those wounds. "The only way you can improve this is by changing the underlying model and processes," says Tim Tate, global head of client experience at Citi Private Bank's Canary Wharf headquarters in London.
		Much of his bank's transformation process is influenced by its Citi Ventures private equity arm in Palo Alto, California, which helps Citi take a five-year view of digitisation and not get bogged down in the daily IT grind of updating websites and tweaking apps.
		Digitisation has, so far, improved the "line speed" of existing services, but it has yet to cause any real disruption or innovation, says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, an asset management consultancy.
		Unlike retailers and other commerce sectors, wealth and asset managers are still missing a huge digital opportunity. "The mindset of many firms is simply to adapt existing capabilities," says Sebastian Dovey, co-founder of Scorpio Partnership, the wealth management consultancy.
		The next stage has to be a complete transformation of the industry, and, believes Mr Dovey, revising the engagement rules between bank, client and wealth. They could even go as far as aiming for the sentiment of another hit song of the Buggles era, Fern Kinney's "Together we are beautiful".

<titre>Bouygues' rejection hits sector's shares  Telecoms: French connections</titre>
<auteur>By Adam Thomson in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		French telecoms stocks plunged as hopes of consolidation evaporated after Bouygues Telecom turned down a €10bn offer from rival Numericable-SFR.
		Shares in Bouygues, the conglomerate headed by Martin Bouygues that includes France's third-biggest mobile operator, fell 8 per cent as soon as markets opened. Shares in Numericable-SFR, the mobile operator controlled by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi ,dropped 10.4 per cent.  Shares in Iliad, the low-cost operator, fell 6 per cent. Shares in Altice, Mr Drahi's Amsterdam-listed holding company, which controls Numericable-SFR, were down 6.4 per cent.
		The rejection all but kills the prospect of the number of operators going from four to three competitors, a move that many analysts see as vital to ending a three-year price war.
		In a research note, Jerry Dellis of Jefferies said: "The categorical terms in which Bouygues rejected Numericable-SFR's offer last night make it difficult to envisage any improved offer succeeding until next year."
		Stephane Beyazian of Raymond James went further. "Hopes of French market consolidation have now completely disappeared in our opinion," he said in a note.
		Mr Bouygues' decision will probably be welcomed by France's Socialist government, which had opposed Mr Drahi's plans, arguing they would be bad for investment in the sector, bad for consumers and bad for employment.
		"It's rather obvious that this transaction will destroy jobs, which is what some like to call synergies," Emmanuel Macron, economy minister said yesterday. "We are against this choice."
		Mr Macron held a meeting with Mr Drahi before Bouygues announced its decision. "We talked about investment in the sector," Mr Drahi said as he left the ministry.
		Some were surprised by Mr Bouygues' determination to retain the telecoms company he launched in 1996. Analysts viewed Mr Drahi's offer as generous given the operator's poor financial health as a result of the price war.
		One person close to the situation said that Mr Bouygues' resistance had to do with his proximity to the government. "When you say no to €10bn sitting on the table, it means only one thing: that you are establishment," they said.
		But Mr Bouygues, 63, who took over the group from his father in 1989, said that there had been no political pressure.
		He told RTL radio on Wednesday: "A company is not just any old piece of merchandise. Not everything is for sale."
		Mr Bouygues said that he doubted how Mr Drahi, who has funded a €36bn acquisition spree over the past year and a half with debt that he spreads across the acquired units, could pull off a purchase of Bouygues Telecom.
		"I don't see how Mr Drahi could set up serious financing and, at the same time, take on all of the remedies" the competition authorities would have demanded, he said.
		He was confident his mobile operator would return to financial health by 2017 thanks to deep internal restructuring and to the unit's portfolio of spectrum and its extensive 4G network.
		Shortly after announcing the offer, Numericable-SFR said that it had entered into exclusive talks with Iliad, controlled by Xavier Niel , a billionaire, over the sale of assets related to the bid for Bouygues.
		Mr Bouygues said that he had been "a little astonished to see that Mr Drahi and Mr Niel were arm in arm".
		Altice declined to comment.
		Founder's snub Saying 'no' to Drahi was a task to be savoured When a reporter once asked Martin Bouygues whether he would sell Bouygues Telecom, the industrialist fired back: "Would you sell your wife?"
		Such is the love that Mr Bouygues, below, a member of one of France's most renowned industrialist families, has for the telecoms unit he founded almost 20 years ago he turned down a €10bn cash offer - up to double what some analysts think it is worth.
		"He is like a farmer guarding his farm," said one person who knows him. "He has a rational approach but also a deeply affective one, which explains his decision."
		Mr Bouygues, who likes hunting on the weekends, became chief executive of the group his father, Francis, founded 63 years ago in 1988.
		A year later, he replaced him as chairman, taking over the reins of a conglomerate that spans construction, property development and media, via the television channel TF1, the country's biggest private broadcaster.
		Among the other projects, Bouygues built the European Parliament building in Strasbourg, <meronyme id="2159">the Arche de La Défense</meronyme> in Paris, the headquarters of the UK's Home Office in London, and the Stade de France.
		Bouygues Telecom, Mr Bouygues' clearest contribution to the family-controlled business, had revenues last year of more than €33bn and operating profit of €1.1bn. The group has more than 127,000 employees, who hold 23.3 per cent of Bouygues shares.
		Mr Bouygues, an affable figure known for self-deprecating charm, last year lost out to Patrick Drahi as the two men slugged it out in a fight for SFR, the mobile unit of Vivendi. Slamming the door shut in Mr Drahi's face probably failed to compensate for that, but few could doubt that Mr Bouygues enjoyed it.

		Anyone looking to expand their property portfolio may well have encountered the term "value gap". It is a current favourite among estate agents to describe the price discrepancy between city and provincial markets. According to research from Savills, it can be substantial: in the UK the London property market is today about 35 per cent above its 2007 peak; in rural areas house prices are still 13 per cent down.  There is increasing talk about the bargains available by trading in a city bolt-hole for a place in the country. Oliver Knight, of estate agents Knight Frank, estimates that a well turned-out home in the Cotswolds will sell for about £500 per sq ft, while in inner London it is hard to find anything below £1,250 per sq ft. In super prime areas, such as Mayfair, that figure can be above £2,200, according to joint research from Lonres and Dataloft.
		Overseas, the uplift can be even more pronounced. Diletta Giorgolo Spinola, head of sales at Sotheby's office in Tuscany, says that the price per sq metre of an apartment in Rome is at least four times higher than that of a villa in the Marche countryside, and often a lot more. According to figures published by the Notaries of France, median prices in Paris can be up to seven times that of rural or provincial areas.
		So, given £1m in spending money, is it better to go for a compact city pad or a sprawling country manor? The FT has compiled a list of five locations to show the difference.
		But before you decide which, it might be worth considering some words of warning from Roarie Scarisbrick, of the buying agents Property Vision. Earlier this year, he thought about trading in a three-bedroom house in Fulham and moving to the countryside outside London.
		"I had dreams of gatehouses and lodges and rolling hills, and had to come back with my tail between my legs," he says. "The reality is a tiny house in London is worth about as much as a tiny house in the home counties." Only once you move beyond a commutable distance from the capital - Scarisbrick estimates about 70 miles away - does the value gap start to open up.
		Still, with London fading - the prime market having dropped about 0.9 per cent in the 12 months to the first quarter of 2015, according to Savills - and the rural market holding steady, is now as good a time as any to buy a place in a remote corner of the countryside?
		"It's not a bad idea, but only if it works for you," says Scarisbrick. "If you're doing it for an investment play, then the chance of you making any money is a bit of gamble."

<titre>Police fired 5,000 bullets in shootout at terrorists' lair  Raid on plotters' fortress Mobile phone of Bataclan attacker found in bin led officers to flat and plans for another atrocity Terror threat</titre>
<auteur>By Gordon Rayner, David Chazan, Henry Samuel and David Barrett in Paris</auteur>

		FRENCH police fired five thousand bullets during a ferocious seven-hour kill-or-capture operation in which the mastermind of the Paris attacks is believed to have been shot dead.
		A dawn raid on an apartment block in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis was so violent that police must wait for the results of DNA tests to identify the remains of two terrorists who were killed, but the Washington Post claims two intelligence sources have confirmed one of the dead is Abdelhamid Abaaoud.  Until Tuesday, the French security services assumed the only way to neutralise Abaaoud was through airstrikes on Raqqa, because he was believed to be in Syria, where he had become one of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's most high-profile recruiters.

		Worse still, it appeared he was controlling another terrorist cell preparing for a fresh wave of attacks on Paris.
		A vital new lead came from a mobile phone thrown into a bin by one of the terrorists who attacked the Bataclan concert hall on Friday night. The last text message sent from it, at 9.42pm, just as the assault on the Bataclan was starting, said: "Off we go, here we go again." Analysis of the phone's content and its GPS tracker led police not only to a safe house in Alfortville, in the south-east of Paris, but also suggested Abaaoud was in Saint-Denis. A female cousin of Abaaoud, Hasna Aitboulahcen, was placed under surveillance on Tuesday, and at 4.20am local time yesterday (3.20GMT), when police thought their targets would be at their most vulnerable, they moved in with lethal force to the building where she and Abaaoud were believed to be hiding.
		Officers from the elite RAID anti-terrorism unit - many of whom had been in action during the attacks on Friday - moved into the apartment block in Rue du Corbillon hoping to blast their way into the suspects' third-floor flat and capture them before they could react.
		But their way was barred by a reinforced door which held out against the explosive charges placed against it. What had been planned as a lightning raid was about to turn into one of the fiercest gun battles on French soil in decades. The sound of automatic gun-fire woke the residents in the next street, Rue de la République, and the surrounding area as police exchanged shots with the terrorists.
		At 4.45am, police got their first breakthrough, when they gained control of a second suspect apartment and arrested three men inside.
		But the main target flat was proving impossible. As officers struggled to gain control, Diesel, a seven-year-old German Shepherd police dog, was sent into the building at 5am to tackle the terrorists, only to be shot dead.
		Stephane Colas, 41, who lives near Rue de la République, said: "I was woken at about 5am by a police helicopter going round and round. I went outside to see what was happening and the police were going house to house. They were saying 'evacuate, evacuate'."
		Aitboulahcen appeared at a window, shouting "help me, help me", perhaps to lure the police in. She was told that if she did not stay where she was, she would be shot, but went back inside.
		At around 6am, police began a fresh assault. Their targets were ready for them, wearing their suicide vests. Aitboulahcen was the first to open fire during the fresh exchange, using a Kalashnikov assault rifle.
		The police tried to talk to Aitboulahcen, asking her: "Where's your boyfriend?" "He's not my boyfriend!" she screamed in reply.
		Seconds later, she detonated a suicide vest, killing herself and causing the floor of the apartment to collapse. The explosion was so violent that her spine was later found lying in the street outside. A second terrorist, believed to be Abaaoud, was killed in the battle that ensued, after being "riddled with bullets" and hit by fragments from a grenade.
		Unsure how many more terrorists were in the building, the police fell back, and for the next three hours Saint-Denis was the location of a siege.
		François Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said: "It was an extremely difficult assault, because the armoured door did not give way straight away to police explosives, thus allowing the terrorists to prepare their riposte. Very heavy, almost uninterrupted gunfire ensued for almost an hour. On the police side we fired almost 5,000 munitions."
		Residents of Rue de la Republique and La Rue Corbillon were told to stay indoors as a police cordon was set up around the apartment building. Then a small robot equipped with a camera, similar to those used in bomb disposal, was sent into the flat to check if anyone was still inside.
		"It's as if war has come to our neighbourhood," said Mohamed Diallo, 22. "It's like a siege. People haven't gone to work and everyone is keeping the children at home."
		At around 7.30am local time, a series of explosions signalled the start of another assault by the police, now numbering 110 specialist officers.
		Five or six explosions were heard, followed by a 90-second pause, then another half dozen blasts. Police had discovered that two suspects were hiding in the debris caused by the initial assault and suicide bomb, and managed to take them alive. One of those arrest-ed was brought out naked from the waist down, suggesting he had been ordered to strip off by officers to prove he was not wearing a suicide belt. Inside the flat was a wealth of evidence that showed another terrorist attack had been foiled. Weapons, explosives, suicide vests and plans were among the items seized.
		With no time to lose, police began questioning the three men arrested in the flat, to establish what they had planned and whether other suspects were still at large. They had reportedly been planning a fresh wave of attacks against <mention id="2161">La Defense</mention>, <mention id="2162">the financial district of Paris,</mention>  and Charles de Gaulle airport, Europe's second-busiest. Mr Molins said: "Everything leads us to believe that given their weaponry and level of preparation, they were ready to act."
		Jawad Bendaoud, the owner of the flat, was speaking to reporters when he was arrested. He said: "A friend asked me to let the house to his mates for a couple of days. I was asked to help pepple out. I had no idea who they were. I don't know them from Adam."
		His friend told him the men were coming from Belgium and needed a place to stay for a couple of days. "I told them there were no mattresses and they said 'That's OK,' they just wanted water and a place to pray," he said.
		A friend of Mr Bendaoud - who was sentenced to eight years in prison for killing his best friend in a fight in 2006 - said she had slept in the apartment last week and it was a "sort of squat".
		Meanwhile, police feared the top-floor flat could have been booby trapped with explosives, or that other terrorists were still hiding there.
		For the next three hours police planned their next move, evacuating all residents of the block and checking their backgrounds to check for any possible links to the terrorists.
		Just after 11.30am local time, police confirmed that the operation was over. The apartment building was so badly damaged that it had to be shored up before forensic teams could move in.
		Two men and a woman were arrested nearby, bringing the total number held to eight, including Mr Bendaoud.
		Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, paid tribute to the police who have "never before come under such gunfire". Five officers were injured.
		François Hollande, the French president, described the raid as "a particularly perilous and heavy police operation", and paid tribute to police who "knew the dangers, yet no doubt still underestimated the violence that they would come up against".

<titre>The Luxury Visionaries  For our inaugural Visionaries issue, Telegraph Luxury enlisted the talents of master lensman Christopher Sturman and canvassed opinion from our band of industry experts in selecting the most daring and experimental innovators in their felds.

		What makes a visionary? The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word as 'a person with original ideas about what the future will, or could be like'. Apply that to the realm of luxury and it makes the achievements of our particular line-up even more extraordinary.
		This is a sector where the pillars of tradition are studiously upheld, where the cogs of progress move gradually and where studied craft and meticulous engineering take precedent - which makes the waves of change created by our host of luminaries all the more exciting. From redefining how we engage with our space and environment, like Professor Di Trapani as founder of lighting technology brand CoeLux, to tailoring a new future for one of the most storied historical houses in the world, like Jason Basmajian of Savile Row stalwart Gieves &amp; Hawkes, these are the names shaping not just the high-net-worth world, but the ebb and fow of social shifts. In these pages, our pioneering men and women talk to our panel of experts and allow us into their worlds.  PROFESSOR PAOLO DI TRAPANI | c O m O Founder and cEO, CoeLux Srl Nominated by Ken Kessler As a physicist of the Department of Science and High Technology at the University of Insubria in Como, Di Trapani, 53, became captivated by the book Light and Color in the Outdoors, a study of natural optical phenomena. After 12 years of experimentation, Professor Di Trapani's attempts to replicate natural light indoors have become the most convincing solution yet for flling our homes with illumination indistinguishable from sunlight.
		WE SAY: We diferentiate between artifcial and natural light automatically, but seeing what you'd swear is natural light within the home, at night, in a room without windows borders on the miraculous. Beyond the sheer beauty of natural light - and Di Trapani's technology enables users to specify the daylight of particular regions - this technology will help travellers who sufer jet-lag, those who dwell in regions with long winters and others who would beneft from the sense of wellbeing that sunlight imparts. That Di Trapani speaks of it continually by referencing the light in great artworks begs you to get in touch with your inner Hockney.
		hE SAYS: 'The person who frst mentioned to me the idea of the connection between fre and the latest artifcial lighting was Mr Henrik Clausen, director of Fagerhult Lighting Academy. The work of architect Rudolf Schwarz also triggered the investigation, funded by the European Union. It began as a research project, an obsession with the visual efect of the sun and the sky, and a dedication to the notion that we are not built to live in dark boxes.' LOOK OUT FOR: The CoeLux lighting installation can currently be seen in situ at Ideaworks Experience Centre, 206 Great Portland Street, W1.
		ideaworks.co.uk; coelux.com ANNAbELLE SELLDORF | N EW Y O R K Founder and cEO, Selldorf Architects Nominated by caroline Roux Cologne-born Annabelle Selldorf, 53, set up her own architectural practice in the late 1980s and now employs a staf of 60, who occupy an airy space in New York's Union Square that was once home to Andy Warhol's Factory. Of her 30 years in the United States she says, 'It's given me time to acquire a sense of humour. Germans can be too serious, and humour is the key to just about everything.' WE SAY: Selldorf's stealthy way of inserting the new into the old frst made her a huge hit with the New York art world, for whom she has created many galleries and homes. Clients include Hauser &amp; Wirth gallery, Cindy Sherman and Eric Fischl. In late 2013, she completed a magnifcently modern recycling facility in Brooklyn and she currently has six new residential towers taking shape in Manhattan. They have to measure up to her celebrated building at 200 11th Avenue where, thanks to an internal ramp, residents can park right outside their own front door.
		ShE SAYS: 'We don't always need new buildings, which is why I've always enjoyed working inside old ones, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to do new ones, too. I love the way the scale of our work has grown, from rooms to houses to big buildings. I think that's the right way. But everything in the ofce is still driven by my ideas, all the design direction is generated by me.' LOOK OUT FOR: Her $30m extension of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego in La Jolla, to go on site in early 2017. It will take her reputation to the next level. selldorf.com Carlo Brandelli | l o n d o n Freelance creative director, Kilgour nominated by Bill Prince During his frst tenure at the long-standing Savile Row house (1998-2008), Brandelli, 44, introduced a modernist's expression to its ready-to-wear, shorn of unnecessary decoration yet true to the defning elements of a man's wardrobe. Returning last year with new owners at the helm, he's now reimagining the brand's bespoke business as the epitome of 'male couture'.
		We SaY: Whether you view Carlo Brandelli's wholesale reinvention of men's tailoring as the work of an iconoclast or an innovator depends on your faith in the unfinching traditionalism to be found elsewhere on the Row. For his part, the creative - who absented himself for a six-year hiatus during which he dedicated himself to sculpture - is focused entirely on re-imagining male attire. Brandelli's strictly contemporary lines are born of his fervently modernist aesthetic: the signature single-button suits with slim, fat-fronted trousers developed during his initial stint have now been joined by a range of bespoke collar designs, as well as fussfree details drawn from the disciplines of art and architecture - intellectual sensibilities he shares with many of the customers for his rarefed yet exquisitely executed pieces.
		He SaYS: 'The references to architecture that people see in my work are a response to seeing something that not only has an aesthetic value but also has a "measured" quality. Men like beauty but also appreciate the data in construction; they need to know that there is theory in the proposal. And the orderly way in which you design a piece of tailoring and question why a detail is there and the proportion of it, or where anything extraneous or without function can be left aside, is very close to an architectural sensibility.' look oUT For: Kilgour's ongoing conversation with the precepts of modernism that pushes the boundaries of what constitutes a Savile Row suit. kilgour.com MaxiMilian BUSSer | g e n e va Founder, MB&amp;F nominated by James gurney Maximilian Büsser, 48, founded MB&amp;F 10 years ago following a transformational stint as the MD of Harry Winston Rare Timepieces. MB&amp;F (Maximilian Büsser and Friends) began as the logical next step to the collaborative strategy that Büsser pioneered with the Opus series - which saw Harry Winston partner with independent watchmakers - and has since produced some of the most creative 'horological machines' ever seen and, in a neat reversal, partnered with the likes of Boucheron and Richard Mille.
		We SaY: Büsser's drive and self-belief are matched by a playfulness and appreciation of the watchmakers he works with, as well as an understanding of the creative possibilities that collaboration unleashes. It's a combination that has shifted perceptions of what a watch can be and has found a natural extension in the M.A.D. Gallery project. Büsser has been the brains behind projects ranging from music boxes dressed as star-fghters to an academic reworking of the traditional watch, all produced to the standards he learnt to expect at Jaeger-LeCoultre.
		He SaYS: 'This year we're celebrating our 10th anniversary, under the theme "a creative adult is a child who survived". We're working on dozens of projects over the next three to four years - my job is clearly Chief Juggling Ofcer!' look oUT For: This year will see 17 launches: nine MB&amp;F creations and eight artists creating shows at M.A.D. Galleries worldwide. mdandf.com FARSHID MOUSSAVI | l O n D O n Founder and Director, Farshid Moussavi Architecture nominated by Caroline Roux The Iranian-born, UK and US-educated architect and newly elected Royal Academician, 49, received her frst big commission aged just 30 - a ferry terminal in Yokohama, which went on to accumulate prize after prize - as part of Foreign Ofce Architects. She set up on her own in 2011 and now her 20-strong team works from the very same building where Thomas Cubitt, the architect of Belgravia's surrounding creamy streets, practised his craft.
		WE SAY: Moussavi has a unique ability to provide the unexpected, from the incredible Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art - a dazzling block of faceted mirror-fnish black stainless steel - to the interior of Victoria Beckham's Mayfair store, completed last autumn. There, a combination of elegantly fexible spaces, concrete cofered ceilings, a processional staircase and the most ingenious hanging system (clothes, suspended from goldcoloured chains, can be viewed through 270 degrees without leaving the hanger) make it one of the most exciting retail spaces in quite a while.
		SHE SAYS: 'I had to leave Iran in 1979, when I was 14, and that experience makes you adaptable and fearless. I feel the same about architecture, approaching every new project from a fresh perspective. Architecture is also full of uncertainties and the unseen - it's not just about design: the economy can collapse; the local mayor can change. I don't mind dealing with those kind of outcomes.' This pragmatism is combined with a love of fashion from Comme des Garçons, Maison Margiela, Hussein Chalayan, and very high heels.
		lOOk OUt FOR: An imposing ofce building in black futed glass in the heart of the City of London, and in Paris a mixed-use block in <mention id="2163">La Défense</mention>, where each storey is rotated delicately through two degrees to give oblique balconies and loggias, allowing perfect views along the Grande Axe, right back to the Arc de Triomphe. farshidmoussavi.com James Taffin de Givenchy | n ew y o r k founder, Tafn nominated by maria doulton In 1996 jeweller James Tafn de Givenchy, 52, nephew of the famous couturier, created the Tafn salon in New York to receive private commissions. Born in France and trained as a graphic designer, de Givenchy was previously head of jewellery at Christie's for the West Coast. He then went on become vice president of the jewellery house Verdura. From 2006, for fve years, he was creative director of Sotheby's Diamonds, where his unorthodox approach to jewellery making found a new audience.
		we say: De Givenchy is constantly on the move. Never predictable, he takes the stufness out of very precious jewels - think six-fgure price tag rings and more - and creates something for a woman who chooses her jewels as boldly as her clothes. His eclectic style is prodigious: from a wrist-wrapping cuf with an amethyst the size of a golf ball to a revered 10-carat Golconda diamond surrounded by a minimalist fash of grey hi-tech ceramic or the most delicate little cherry-bright ruby ring that hovers of-centre over the fnger. De Givenchy is not afraid to go where no one else has gone before and combines valuable stones with materials as diverse as rubber, molten AK47 machine guns and marble.
		he says: 'Little by little, as I learnt more about stones at Christie's when I was younger, it started to make sense. I also fell in love with design and realised that jewellery was about much more than the sum of its parts.
		'I always look for what are called in the trade, "sexy stones". Sometimes they're new, sometimes old, but always unusual. If needed, I will have them re-cut. I then try to build something new with them. I like to surprise myself with eclectic combinations of shapes and colours.
		'As I have my own atelier I can control every step of the manufacturing process and I enjoy trying out diferent ways of doing things. I have built a team of artisans who like a good challenge and are not afraid of experimenting.' look oUT for: In addition to his growing collection of colourful ceramic jewels, de Givenchy is working on a book and has plans to create a fragrance. tafn.com ewan venTers | l o n d o n ceo, Fortnum &amp; Mason nominated by victoria moore Headhunted from Selfridges in summer 2012, Venters, 42, has worked astonishingly fast to make a 308-year-old brand relevant to a discerning metropolitan crowd. His eforts show in the bottom line: Fortnum's reported record profts of £74.4m in the year to July 2014 and the store had a bumper Christmas season with like-for-like sales up 18 per cent (and a total growth of 23 per cent on the previous year).
		we say: In the past couple of years Fortnum's eau-de-nil livery has been getting out and about, with store openings in St Pancras, Dubai and Terminal 5, where there's also now a Fortnum &amp; Mason bar. Fife-born Venters took the grande dame of Piccadilly to her frst festival at Port Eliot last summer and oversaw a lavish pop-up in the arcade skirting the Somerset House skating rink. Three years ago 70 per cent of Fortnum's business was international; now it's a store at which Londoners also shop for high-quality food (fresh produce, such as beef and bread, is now very strong) and wine, as well as boutique gins from its gleaming new Spirits Room.
		he says: 'A lot of people felt attached to Fortnum's from a historical point of view. I wanted them to connect with it today. It's important to get out and about; you can't run retail or a restaurant from an ofce. Also, always try to hire bright people, they'll keep you in your job longer.' look oUT for: The redesigned (by architectural and interior designers Waldo Works) second foor where all things beauty and fragrance are found. Tea, hampers, biscuits and jam may be the powerhouse products for which Fortnum's is known, but perfume is also on the up. The Fountain Restaurant will be closing for a major overhaul in summer, reopening in mid-September. fortnumandmason.com JUlIE dE lIBRAN | pA R I S Artistic director, Sonia Rykiel Nominated by Caroline Issa As the creative director of womenswear at Louis Vuitton for several years under Marc Jacobs, Julie de Libran, 43, was responsible for the brand's successful pre-fall, resort and Icons collections. Jump ahead a few years, and de Libran is fnally taking her own well-deserved spotlight, heading up storied Rive-Gauche label Sonia Rykiel.
		WE SAY: De Libran's Sonia Rykiel woman is unmistakably Parisian cool but will surely appeal to women from Shanghai to Rio looking for essential pieces and a new take on the famous Rykiel knits. Her debut Spring/Summer 2015 collection is made up of easy wardrobe must-haves - cotton culottes that fall perfectly, masculine tailoring with a twist, and fantastic sweaters most women will want to live in, and all featuring the details the original Sonia Rykiel made famous - bold buttons, colourful shades and indigo knits masquerading as denim. Her fashion shows have already become buzzy, notto-be-missed events, and her most recent autumn collection was shown in the fagship store decorated with 50,000 French novels sourced from around the country. A breath of fresh (and commercially savvy) air has blown into the Left Bank.
		ShE SAYS: 'My Rykiel woman is made up of many diferent women - but she has something to say, she are is passionate and doing something that she loves. The house is small, though over 40 years old, and we want to be both accessible and desirable. It's a lifestyle.' lOOk OUT FOR: This year de Libran will be sprinkling her magic touch on a Sonia Rykiel kidswear capsule and a homewares collection, as well as a small unisex knitwear line.
		soniarykiel.com JASON BASMAJIAN | l O N d O N Creative director, Gieves &amp; Hawkes Nominated by Stephen doig Since taking the helm at the august Savile Row house in 2013, Boston-born Basmajian, 45, has ushered the slumbering giant into a new era. The designer, who previously worked at Italian house Brioni, continues to nod to the history of the tailoring institution that outftted Napoleon while re-interpreting the house for a new generation.
		WE SAY: Basmajian hasn't allowed the daunting heritage of Gieves &amp; Hawkes to impede on his razorsharp eye for what the modern tailoring connoisseur should be wearing, as his pin-sharp pieces and sumptuous embroidered eveningwear handsomely attests. But alongside the structure and rigour so inherent to the house, Basmajian has introduced a softer silhouette and a relaxed line of of-duty pieces; still handcrafted in peerless fabrics but built with weekend functionality in mind. A refurbishment of the building last year (which sits, stately as a sentinel, at No.1 Savile Row) saw the centuries-old edifce reimagined by interior designer Teresa Hastings.
		hE SAYS: 'The object has always been to take a beautiful brand, a brand with the most incredible military history, and maintain that British accent while making it international. It's about aligning Savile Row with the men's luxury world across the globe, and we've modernised our image by working with contemporary, noble materials that appeal to a new demographic of customer. We've elevated the product to encompass better fabrics, modern sportswear, weekend wear and hand-crafted readyto-wear that combines masculinity with elegance.' lOOk OUT FOR: Plans for 2015 include in-store shops at Harrods and Paris department store Le Bon Marché, as well as building on the house's expanding client base. gievesandhawkes.com Nicholas culliNaN | l o N d o N director, National Portrait Gallery Nominated by louisa Buck Two years ago, rising art-world star Nicholas Cullinan was poached from Tate Modern to take up the prominent post of curator of modern and contemporary art at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Now he's back in London where, in April, having seen of some weighty competition, he will become the newly appointed 12th director in the NPG's 158-year history and, at 37, one of its youngest.
		We say: The American-born, Yorkshirebred Cullinan may be young but he already has considerable form. He was co-curator of Tate Modern's blockbuster Henri Matisse: Cutouts show with Nicholas Serota and played a key role in its Malevich, Cy Twombly and Pop Life exhibitions.
		Cullinan is also well connected internationally: before leaving Tate Modern he set up a new acquisition committee of well-heeled collectors to build up its holdings in modern and contemporary art from Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and he's been helping Miuccia Prada to shape the programme for the Fondazione Prada's new venue in Milan, which opens on 9 May.
		he says: 'Right now I think that the National Portrait Gallery is especially relevant because so much of what we understand and learn about history and society is through images of people. One question is how to refect British society and the way it is changing, and how to celebrate the best aspects of that; but I'm keen not to focus exclusively on the modern and contemporary. I want to make the programme strong across all the periods the NPG represents: I don't think you necessarily have to do contemporary art to be relevant to the present moment.' look out for: Some surprising combinations of the old and new. Also, as Cullinan has fagged up the 'huge potential' of the NPG's popularity with artists from across the world, expect some interesting commissions. npg.org.uk ece siriN | i s ta N B u l founder and creative director, Bee Goddess Nominated by annabel davidson It took a meeting with an astrologer to convince Turkish designer Ece Sirin to leap from her spot on the highest rungs of the corporate ladder (she previously held senior marketing positions at Coca-Cola and Microsoft) and into the deep pools of mysticism - and fne jewellery.
		We say: Sirin's jewellery brand Bee Goddess may be all about nourishing the inner self, but that doesn't mean it shies away from luxury. Talismans in gold, diamonds and precious gemstones fy from its counter at Harrods, where it's consistently one of the bestsellers in the luxury jewellery category.
		From sacred geometry and alchemy to ancient philosophy and mythology, Sirin has taken a global survey of symbolism and turned it into a vast array of pretty, shimmering pieces that might just make you feel like buying diamonds is an act of self-help.
		she says: 'In 2004, I made my frst moon goddess Artemis pendant as a 'symbol of my soul'; she was the key to opening the door to my own potential. I have been researching the symbols of mythology and alchemy for the past 10 years, and I am continually researching new designs and working on my book of symbols to share spiritual wisdom and power. I feel that through my work I am spreading a light… But I'm not Mother Theresa. This is still luxury.' look out for: Sirin doesn't rest on her laurels - in 2015 she aims to fnish a book, launch an exhibition at Fenwick, and fnd the perfect space for a London fagship store. beegoddess.com Below: Turkish jewellery designer Ece Sirin, wearing her Light of Heaven rosegold and diamond hand bracelet £1,345; Ishtar Star rose-gold and diamond hand bracelet £1,790; Artemis white-gold and diamond necklace £3,970; Ouroboros rose-gold, white and black diamond and ruby ring, £3,610; Sacred Geometry Six rose-gold and diamond ring, £2,260; yellow-gold and diamond Earth ring, £2,200, all from harrods.com Above: Fire rose-gold and diamond ring, £2,380; Rosa Mundi rose-gold and black diamond bracelet, £5,990; Eros Arrow rosegold and black diamond bracelet, £1,790; Sword rose-gold and black diamond necklace, £990; all from harrods.com Studio SWiNE | l o N d o N Co-founders, Studio Swine Nominated by Henrietta thompson Co-founded by Anglo-Japanese husband-andwife team architect Azusa Murakami, 30, and artist Alexander Groves, 31, Studio Swine has established a new niche in design collectables and communication, using innovative processes and materials such as human hair, melted tin cans and sea-dredged plastic to create thoughtprovoking artworks, flms and luxury products.
		WE SAY: Studio Swine's investigative approach to design has made for some compelling stories. Shunning the conventional brand/designer commissions, Studio Swine use their products and processes to explore and rethink environmental, geographical and social issues. For Hair Highway (a project in collaboration with Pearl Lam Gallery) they lived in Shanghai and travelled to the world's largest hair market in Shandong Province, flming it for the frst time. Inspired by Shanghai deco and Qing dynasty antiques, they set the hair into resin to make highly collectable accessories such as combs and sunglasses (currently on show as part of What is Luxury? at the V&amp;A, see page 68).
		tHEY SAY: 'We go about making a project by immersing ourselves in a place and researching its crafts, materials and culture. The process is like journalism but it results in a flm and collection of objects rather than an article. We aim to make work that goes beyond the design audience: the Hair Highway flm was featured by National Geographic and our flms have received over one million views online. The objects may be limited in production but the message is not.' look out for: The results of a recent Cape Town project in which the pair operated a furnace to melt scrap and reform it into ingots and objects. Selected for the 2015 Designers of the Future Award they are making works for Design Miami/Basel, and have designed a series of outdoor seating for Crown Estate's St James's market development, to be unveiled this spring.

Launching his eponymous label in 2008, Jackson's range of products harness the power of natural products native to sub-Saharan Africa, using plants such as the Kigelia, Baobob tree and arnica in a series of oils, serums and day creams.
		WE SAY: The benefts of Dr Jackson's products aren't just skin deep (although the results are considerable); Jackson ensures that a portion of the profts go to the African communities that grow the crops, with ambitions to double the annual living wage per household. There are plenty of brands bandying the 'natural' tagline around, but Jackson's range of products, which debuted last year on Mr Porter before launching at London's Mondrian hotel, are the work of intense scientifc development, bioinnovation and sponsorship from the United Nations. There aren't many things in your bathroom cabinet that you can say make a real social impact.

We are also about education and I think people are ready to learn about the power of natural products.' look oUT FoR: The launch of a debut face wash; a collaboration with a university in Hong Kong to explore the possibilities of wound-healing species of plants; launching within the One&amp;Only group of spas and a move into the Asian market.

		PARIS began an advertising campaign yesterday aimed at poaching bankers from London after Brexit.
		Billboards showing a green frog wearing a tie sporting the colours of the French flag and the slogan "Tired of the fog? Try the Frogs! Choose <mention id="2164">Paris La Defense</mention>" are being put up at Heathrow and the London Eurostar station, at St Pancras International, showcasing <mention id="2165">the French capital's business district</mention>.
		Some bankers have warned that London could gradually lose its position as the only financial capital to rival New York because foreign banks could move out after Brexit, draining the City of talent and wealth. London accounts for 41 per cent of global foreign exchange turnover, more than double that of New York.

<titre>Falling for Paris again?</titre>

		What a difference a (possible) Brexit makes. Four years ago France's new president, François Hollande, taking aim at the wealthy, had bankers squarely in his sights. "My true adversary is the world of finance," he had said during the campaign, touting a Franco-German pact to attack the "dominance of finance" and tilt Europe back towards traditional industry. In office, he launched a 75 per cent super-tax on earnings above €1m and hiked France's wealth tax, the annual levy on valuable assets.  The super-tax was quietly shelved at the beginning of last year. By July this year, with the prospect of a UK exit from the EU - which could result in many companies in London's financial sector seeking out a new base - Hollande's administration was in full U-turn mode.
		Manuel Valls, the prime minister, unveiled Europe's "most favourable" fiscal regime for foreign executives. It would include an income tax break of up to 50 per cent on executives who relocated and exclude foreign assets from the wealth tax for eight years (the current exclusion period is five years). "Paris as a financial centre is what makes France's attractiveness," said Valls, to cheers from his audience of leading executives.
		On the face of it, the French capital is well positioned to benefit from a Brexit. Of Europe's major cities, only London has a larger economy of financial and business services (lawyers, recruitment firms and the like), according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. The $350bn annual output of Paris may be less than London's $490bn but it is far ahead of third-placed Moscow's $166bn.
		Europe's second-largest financial and business services sector will not be the only draw for London's wealthy tech and banker types. Hollande's single-minded pursuit of affluent Parisians led to rich locals leaving in droves in the years following his election. Top-end prices fell sharply, leaving averages in this sector less than half that of equivalent homes in London . According to Knight Frank, prime Paris homes sell for between €14,600 and €17,800 per sq metre, compared with a range of €33,000 to €40,300 in London. Over the past three years, prime Paris prices have fallen more than 8 per cent, against a 6.4 per cent gain in London. Over one year, there have been falls of, respectively, 3.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent.
		London's bankers may be delighted at 50 per cent discounts on purchase prices compared with the UK capital, but the costs of keeping a French home are far higher. The French price falls derive in large part from the wealth tax, say agents.
		Last tweaked in 2013, this covers properties valued at €1.3m and above. At €1.3m, it means a 0.5 per cent annual levy of the property's value above €800,000. The marginal rate then increases, in several steps, to 1.5 per cent - at least €150,000 a year - for homes worth more than €10m.
		No wonder some of Paris' finest homes in the fashionable, if dull, 16th and 17th arrondissements are now readily available. "Where large family apartments had been hard to come by, suddenly they were two a penny," says Roddy Aris of Knight Frank.
		Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, of agent Daniel Féau, says the stock of top-end homes has risen 40 per cent since Hollande was elected. The agent has a large five-bedroom apartment on sale in the 17th for €2.85m. For those who hanker for some outside space, the same agent is selling a four-bedroom house with a large garden on the edge of La Muette neighbourhood for €4.75m.
		What Hollande's tax tilt did for international buyers is a moot point. Few earn an income in Paris, meaning that they avoided the super-tax; many more dodged the wealth tax by funding their purchases with mortgages rather than cash. (The proportion of a home's value borrowed from the bank does not attract the tax.)
		Meanwhile, a weakening euro has made the city more appealing to those with dollars to spend. Middle Eastern buyers - long-time fans of the city - returned to the 16th and 17th arrondissements, where they can fit their staff into the large apartments and their motorcades into generous underground car parks, says Lundgreen.
		In the city's centre - a smaller pool of generally smaller flats in the narrower historic streets across the 6th and 7th arrondissements - the tax-fuelled exodus took the pressure off overheated prices. In areas such as the Latin Quarter, small pieds-à-terre were commanding up to €20,000 per sq metre, says Aris. "In the last 12 to 18 months prices have come off and local buyers are returning," he says.
		Nearby on Rue de Bourgogne, in the 7th, Savills is marketing a two-bedroom apartment for €1.99m.
		Buyers from the US - also long-term fans of Paris - are joining them. They have started to return to their favoured Left Bank, south of the Seine as it passes Notre-Dame, says Aris. Despite the prime price falls, the finest flats in the 6th arrondissement still command prices comparable to the grandest in London's Chelsea, says Kate EverettAllen of Knight Frank. "  Mais bien sûr  ," you can hear Hollande retort.

<titre>Brexit bargains</titre>
<auteur>By Hugo Cox</auteur>
<texte>
		The wailing and the weeping is impressive for such a sanguine nation but, before the UK howls itself into a Brexit-based residential property catastrophe, we have polished the collective crystal ball to look at a few themes in this sea of uncertainty around the high-end market in London and south-east England.  Right now is a great time to buy for many international buyers. The fall in sterling means that dollar buyers earlier this week effectively enjoyed an 11 per cent discount compared with the day of the referendum vote. It is also a great time for some domestic buyers thanks to almost non-existent interest rates.
		That said, both Savills and Knight Frank have been warning for several months that London's prime market, historically more volatile than the rest of the country, would bear the brunt of the early Brexit fallout. This is the sector with the highest concentration of non-UK owners. In April the rating agency Moody's estimated that foreign nationals accounted for 49 per cent of sales of homes worth £1m and above. With Britain experiencing its biggest political experiment in a generation, it is likely that, villains or saviours, this group will play a pivotal role.
		Are they likely to exit because of Brexit? Few of London's super-rich consider the UK's membership of Europe's single market as a factor in choosing a London home, according to Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree Estates, who estimates that non-EU international buyers make up 70 to 80 per cent of this market. "These buyers do not care where Europe is at and they don't believe for a second that Brexit means that London's status as a property safe haven is at risk."
		Indeed, following the financial crisis when the UK and Europe were wobbling, these buyers didn't seem to care. Super-prime Mayfair is a favourite destination for many of them - at £2,300 per sq ft, according to Savills, average prices here are 18 per cent above the average in the rest of prime central London. From Mayfair's pricing low point in March 2009 to the end of 2012, a period spanning the end of the UK recession and the darkest days of the eurozone crisis, foreign buyers' appetite helped Mayfair prices gain 61 per cent, far outstripping the 28 per cent prime central London average, according to Savills.
		The priorities for this group of buyers were - and remain - personal safety, the rule of law, a favourable tax regime, good private schools and the great British tradition of political and economic stability, says Mark Parkinson of buying agent Middleton Advisors. While the Brexit turmoil appears, by British standards, to jeopardise the last of these factors, it is worth considering what these buyers are often used to elsewhere: capital controls in China and, increasingly, Russia; the president's impeachment and the worst recession for decades in Brazil; a sinking oil price driving the first ever government bond issue in Saudi Arabia.
		Besides, for this group the fall in sterling goes much of the way towards offsetting the stamp duty rise introduced in December 2014 (now at 15 per cent on any amount above the first £1.5m for a second home), says Naomi Heaton, chief executive of London Central Portfolio Limited, which manages close to £1bn in prime London property.
		Brexit could, however, spell trouble for European bankers who have made their home in London. If the UK does leave the single market, many may find themselves posted abroad. Jefferies, the US investment bank, estimated before the referendum that an exit could see 100,000 banking jobs relocated to Europe. All but 500 of Goldman Sachs' 6,500-strong European workforce are based in London.
		They may not be in a rush to sell their homes if they can avoid it. This is hardly a time for dollar or euro investors to realise gains on London property. Earlier this week, a weaker pound meant that the average Kensington &amp; Chelsea home (valued at £1.315m) was worth roughly £110,000 less than on the day of the referendum vote for those banking in euros. Dollar owners, meanwhile, were £144,000 poorer.
		Even if continental Europeans start deserting the capital, the impact could be muted: only a third of prime London buyers from abroad are from the EU, says Savills. Collectively, non-European international buyers are responsible for a fifth of all second-hand prime sales.
		For international buyers with the stomach for the volatility that may be in store, buying, rather than selling, looks appealing. The downward lurch in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote was the steep dismount at the end of a steady slide. Over the past six months, the combined effect of changes in average property values and shifts in exchange rates, has seen London's 5 per cent most expensive properties get 13 per cent cheaper for euro buyers, and 10 per cent cheaper for those with dollars, according to Hometrack. Over the same period sterling owners in this property elite have seen gains of 1 per cent.
		The impact on London's high-end, new-build market is hard to call but the supply-and-demand equation looks obvious: large numbers of units are coming on stream at the same time as prime central London prices are falling.
		About 19,000 new homes were under construction in inner London in May - 43 per cent more than 18 months earlier, according to research for the FT by Property Vision, a buying agency, and Dataloft, a research company. A total of 6,249 of them were located in SW8, says Anthony Codling of Jefferies, which includes the prime developments peppering Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Power Station. Codling adds that two-thirds of homes on sale in SW8 today are new - the second highest rate of any London postcode.
		Flighty buyers from abroad could threaten prices. Local agents say the new developments - where buyers typically put down between 10 per cent and 20 per cent at exchange and the rest when the homes are completed - have proved very popular with individual investors from Malaysia and China.
		With London's prime market cooling - average prices in prime central London have dropped 8 per cent since their peak in October 2014, according to Savills - many are now selling on the secondary market in order to avoid losses, says Johnny Male, of local agent Daniel Cobb.
		Developers dismiss the claims. The average gain for resales in the development of Battersea Power Station - where 1,500 flats have been sold since January 2013 - is 30 per cent, according to the developer, Battersea Power Station Development Company. But it would not reveal resale price changes since October 2014 when London's prime market started falling.
		Heaton believes that average prices across the area's prime new-builds will fall 20 per over the next two to three years.
		Either way, deals are being struck according to some agents. "[Since the referendum] overseas investors have been coming forward with discounts on their offers," says Nanette Hung of CBRE, the agent selling One Nine Elms, which will include London's tallest residential building, and Nine Elms Point. "We have been doing a lot of haggling."
		If haggling is not your thing then the sub-£1m market in central London is worth examining. This represents half the housing stock, so there is plenty to choose from, particularly in Bayswater, Pimlico, Paddington and Victoria.
		In the immediate future, the big question is, as Judith Evans - the FT's property correspondent - puts it, "whether the new speculative investors will outweigh the people exiting, or those put off relocating to London, because of Brexit".
		Longer term, a positive outlook seems likely because London will probably hang on to its "world city" status. High employment levels may take a drubbing but some of its other world city qualities look like they will remain intact: a forgiving political and physical climate, English as the main language, good IT sector, handy timezone, flourishing arts, lush parkland and excellent global connections.
		One final thought. If prices in London and the south-east do fall more into line with properties in the rest of the country, even if only slightly, there is some cause for celebration. In some areas of the UK prices have never recovered to their pre-financial crisis levels. And while prices in the Midlands and the north have sunk 12.5 per cent since their 2007 peak, prime London has soared 35.2 per cent over the same period, according to Savills.
		As the referendum has vividly demonstrated, extreme inequality fractures society which is no good for anyone or anything, let alone the economy.

		FT writers on what could happen next Judith Evans
		Property correspondent
		From a state of near-overheating, Brexit has cast a sudden chill over the property market in London and the south-east. Early indications are that people are thinking more carefully before committing to large mortgages or moving to bigger homes. Some analysts predict prices will fall, others that they will flatten, but it seems clear the days of double-digit annual price rises have come to an end.
		Izabella Kaminska
		FT Alphaville reporter
		On one hand, London property just got a lot cheaper for foreign buyers at the same time that the capital's offshore financial centre status vis-à-vis the rest of the world may have got a boost. On the other hand, it may see demand cut in half as workers flock back to the continent. While news from estate agents is mixed, concerns are growing for the buy-to-let and rental market. The view here is that an independent UK is unlikely to turn away high-skilled workers or the rich. More realistically the low-skilled sector will be affected, most of whom rent rather than buy.
		Jonathan Guthrie
		City editor
		There should be a tumbleweed or two bowling around Canary Wharf, as investment banks relocate staff to the continent. High-end property in the Docklands, or with good transport links to it, should get a lot cheaper. Upmarket apartments across London should become more affordable. Whether they are decent investments depends on whether you believe the capital will continue to thrive if and when the UK quits the EU.
		Jamil Anderlini

		In recent years, mainland Chinese citizens have overtaken Russian citizens as the single biggest group of foreign buyers of London real estate. With the pound hitting historic lows, the rush by Chinese and other Asian investors is likely to accelerate.

		Property in central London was overvalued before the referendum vote. And it is still overvalued now. The good news? It is getting less overvalued.
		Adam Thomson
		Paris correspondent
		Central London property prices have long been out of reach for ordinary mortals and Brexit won't change that. Paris may be pricey but London is ludicrous. Brexit is a potentially huge opportunity for the French capital to attract international banks and other financial institutions but there is a dearth of high-quality, centrally located office space. If the big banks do decide to move to Paris, they may have to get used to the idea of being in <mention id="2168">La Défense</mention> or other areas outside the capital's city limits.
		Sebastian Payne
		Digital comment editor
		We will only find out the full economic impact of Brexit in a few months' time, but construction is already slowing and the housing market looks unstable. Although a fall in house prices would help those in my generation who have struggled to get on the ladder, the particular issue in London - high demand, low supply - remains unresolved. It is up to Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor, and the government to get building.

<titre>The French capital needs to acquire a head for heights  Paris Notebook</titre>
<auteur>By Adam Thomson</auteur>
<texte>
		For generations, Paris's wide boulevards and elegant balconied buildings have dazzled tourists and given the French capital one of the most beautiful and recognisable faces of any city in the world.
		But when it comes to being competitive in the 21st century, the legacy of Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who oversaw the rebuilding of the city between 1853 and 1870, is one big pain in the backside.  Whatever you think of London's rapidly changing skyline, it has played a critical role in keeping the city in step with the modern world. The UK's capital has more than 20 projects of 50 storeys or more , either under way or in the pipeline, that will provide homes for billionaires and global corporations alike.
		In Paris, things are a little different. Before Christmas, Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest listed commercial property company, applied for a permit to start construction of a 180-metre tall glass triangle of offices, hotel and convention centres designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron.
		If it goes ahead, as expected, the project, designed so as to cast almost no shadow on other buildings in the 15th arrondissement, will be the city's first skyscraper in more than 40 years.
		It is easy to understand the lack of modernisation: Paris's architecture is more uniform than that of London and the city is considerably smaller, offering fewer opportunities for developers. But even by the most conservative standards, Paris has proved remarkably resistant to change.
		Just ask Bernard Arnault: the billionaire behind luxury conglomerate LVMH spent more than a decade fighting in court for his planned redevelopment of the La Samaritaine department store.
		Its proposed Rue de Rivoli façade, a shimmering glass curtain, did not go down well with either residents or preservation groups. Mr Arnault eventually got his way but only by appealing in the Conseil d'État, the country's ultimate authority for administrative matters.
		Meanwhile, the last skyscraper Paris inaugurated was the 1973 Tour Montparnasse, the unloved 210m block that dominates the city's southern skyline. Bad experiences like that have made it even harder to push for new projects.
		Over a recent lunch in Unibail-Rodamco's "model room", a space in its Paris headquarters filled with exquisite skyscraper designs converted into 3D form from the sketchpads of the world's best-known architects, I got a sense of just how hard it is.
		"You see that?" Christophe Cuvillier, the company's chief executive, asked me, pointing to an intriguing model of a Renzo Piano design for an island in the Seine. "It'll never be built. Planning permission is impossible." He points to another model near by. "Nor that one," he says. "Nor that," waving a finger at yet another.
		"Paris is very protective, which is great for charm and cultural history but it has the immediate consequence of leaving no new space."
		The strict codes - bar some exceptions, buildings cannot exceed 31 metres - have left the city woefully short of good offices. So much so that Mr Cuvillier says that, if a company of 700 employees or more wanted to settle in Paris in new or refurbished premises, it would be able to choose from just one of two sites.
		Why should any of this matter when the city has <mention id="2169">La Défense</mention>? <mention id="2170">The area, beyond the capital's western border</mention>, has for years acted as <mention id="2171">Paris's safety valve for office space</mention> and it is now <mention id="2172">Europe's largest business district</mention>.
		One reason, argues Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor who is in charge of urban planning, is that a city cannot stay relevant if all it does is preserve the old.
		Paris, he insists, "has to renew itself century after century". As part of that effort, the mayor's office this month unveiled the winning projects of its "Reinvent Paris" competition to develop 23 sites.
		Unibail-Rodamco's Mr Cuvillier agrees. "Paris needs to be a great place to work and do business, not just a great tourist destination," he says. "A capital city that is attractive is a country that is attractive."

<titre>SocGen to sell its Tower Hill offices ahead of move east</titre>
<auteur>By Rhiannon Bury</auteur>
<texte>
		FRENCH financial services group Societe Generale is to sell its London headquarters ahead of transferring its staff to a new base.
		The company is understood to be seeking offers of more than £85m for its current home near Tower Bridge in the City, which it will then lease back from the purchaser until 2020.  In 2014, Societe Generale agreed to relocate to a new building, currently being constructed in Canary Wharf, in 2019. Its current office building, known as SG House, was built in the late 1980s and there is potential to refurbish or knock down and redevelop the site, which spans 1.7 acres.
		Societe Generale has appointed agents at Savills to handle the sale.
		Societe Generale has had a presence in London since 1871, when it opened its first office outside France. It employs around 2,000 people across the UK.
		The company has around 145,700 staff in 66 countries worldwide, making it one of Europe's largest financial services firms. Its head office is in <mention id="2173">La Defense</mention> in Paris, where it has been since 1995.

<titre>Europe plots a bank heist  FT BIG READ: BREXIT AND THE CITY</titre>
<auteur>By Michael Stothard in Paris, James Shotter in Frankfurt, Vincent Boland in Dublin, Henry Foy in Warsaw and Patrick Jenkins, Martin Arnold and Laura Noonan</auteur>
<texte>
		On a rainy June morning in Paris, five dozen men and women gathered in a basement in <mention id="2174">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="2175">the city's financial district</mention>. Over bitter coffee and fluffy croissants, the great and the good of French politics, business and finance had gathered to plot a heist.  With two weeks to go before the Brexit vote, they wanted to be ready with a sales pitch to lure the international financial groups based in London, should Britain vote to leave the EU. Now, they reasoned, any company with pan-European aspirations would be compelled to move jobs , business lines, even headquarters out of London .
		At the time hardly anyone seemed to believe that the UK electorate would really vote to leave. But that didn't stop the Parisien elite. Jean-Louis Missika, a deputy mayor of Paris, promised he would be "rolling out the red carpet" to bankers if Brexit happened. Gérard Mestrallet, head of the Paris Europlace lobby group, says this was "the moment" for Paris as a financial centre.
		It is a dramatic turning of the tables. Four years ago, Boris Johnson, the then London mayor turned Brexit frontman, who said on Thursday he would not enter the race to be next Conservative prime minister, was goading Paris for the "tyranny and terror" of its rich-soaking tax policies and inviting French bankers to escape to London.  "Vous êtes tous bienvenus,"  he boomed.
		This time it is Paris that is appealing to bankers in London with a "Welcome to Europe" slogan.
		The French charm offensive has been notably aggressive, but they are not alone. Frankfurt and Dublin - and a long list of others from Luxembourg to Warsaw - are now clamouring to appeal to the banks, insurance companies and asset managers for whom using the City of London as a single European hub may no longer be sensible. And where those financial services groups go, a whole host of ancillary roles - in law, accountancy, consultancy and the rest - will follow. Tens of thousands of jobs, out of nearly half a million in the City, could be at risk, financiers estimate.
		The sales pitch is simple. If the UK is outside the EU, financial services companies will be stripped of the " passporting " rules that allow them to operate across borders without local licences. Those companies will need instead to think about a new EU base. The City, which has grown and globalised since the Big Bang deregulation reforms 30 years ago, would shrink and deglobalise.
		Not everyone buys the argument. Some contend the City has an even brighter future as a centre focused less on Europe - excelling, for example, in offshore renminbi trading and financial technology. In any case, bullish British lawyers reckon that UK negotiators will be able to strike a deal to extend passporting. If that proves politically impossible, they point to new rules, under the so-called Mifid II rule book that comes into force in 2018. These should give any non-EU country with "equivalent" financial rules access to the single market on level terms.
		One snag is the risk of an EU country - like France - sensing a competitive opportunity and seeking to have the rules tweaked to disadvantage the UK.
		Even if a good deal is reached, says Simon Gleeson, a lawyer at Clifford Chance who advises many of the big banks, it may be academic. "Banks [will] have to write their contingency plans before they know the [political] situation that will exist in the future."
		In other words, a bank may need to decide to shift chunks of its business to more secure EU locations, regardless of what politicians manage to negotiate.
		French pitch  For banks and investors, there is likely to be an added impetus to move at least some functions to an EU location if, as expected, the European Central Bank insists that future euro-denominated financial trades are cleared and settled within the EU.
		The question, then, is which city will win out?
		Paris can claim the prize for boldness. Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace, says he has already been in talks with half a dozen global banks. "They are shocked about the result, but looking to move people to Paris," he says.
		Promoters of Paris point to several strengths. It has an established financial ecosystem, with five of Europe's 20 largest banks by assets based there. It has a large funds industry managing €3.6tn, second only to London. It is also one of the world's great cities, with its wealth of opera houses, theatres and restaurants. Frankfurt cannot compare, they say.
		Paris is a corporate capital as well as a financial one, says Mr Mestrallet. "In Paris you find clients, whereas in Frankfurt you find rival banks," he says, arguing that Paris should be able to attract jobs in asset management, corporate bonds, foreign exchange and clearing . London currently dominates eurodenominated trading and clearing.
		Detractors highlight an uncertain political and fiscal environment, not least the possibility of a French referendum on EU membership. President François Hollande declared finance his "enemy" in 2012 as he proposed hitting the rich with a 75 per cent tax rate. Foreign banks point to high social charges. A €300,000 salary paid in the UK costs a bank €352,740 a year after all charges, while in France this same salary cost €471,799. Rules introduced in 2008 mean charges do not apply to foreigners for up to five years, but for long-term local staff it is expensive.
		Philippe Villin, an outspoken French investment banker and close adviser of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, says Paris will never become a major financial centre as long as corporate and personal taxes are so high. "At this stage, Paris is almost as appealing as Caracas or Havana for big banks and well-paid and wealthy professionals," he says.
		Lobbying groups say the reforms are coming. Ahead of the UK referendum the French government loosened rules for international bond issues. Reformers are also pushing to extend the advantageous tax status for foreigners and add more international schools.
		Rival claims  Frankfurt has played its pitch cooler, but in many ways is a more natural contender to suck business from the City of London. "I think it is certainly possible that we could see around 10,000 jobs move from London to Frankfurt over the next five years," says Hubertus Väth, from Frankfurt Main Finance, a group that promotes the city as a financial centre. "German, Swiss and US banks are most likely to move." He says it is "relatively clear" that trading activities will shift to Frankfurt.
		Frankfurt's biggest trump card is the presence of the ECB, which not only sets eurozone monetary policy but now also supervises the bloc's biggest banks. "You can argue whether it is good to be the capital of regulation, but the ECB has definitely helped boost the city," says one top German banker.
		At the fulcrum of the London-Frankfurt see-saw is the increasingly fragile-looking merger deal between Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. The headquarters of the group were supposed to be in London - a decision the companies said would transcend the risk of Brexit and strengthen Germany's access to London's more vibrant capital market. But German regulators and politicians have made it clear that a London HQ would no longer be politically acceptable. One London-based banker close to the deal said such a stance betrayed the small-minded attitudes in Frankfurt that would stop it becoming a major financial centre.
		A broader issue militating against Frankfurt is the relative inflexibility of German labour law, such as how expensive it is to fire staff - a particular concern for US banks. Local groups have suggested to the German labour ministry that it consider setting up a zone in Frankfurt where British rather than German labour law is applied as a way of attracting bankers.
		Dublin, the other EU financial centre with broad appeal, is portraying itself as a more natural fit with City types.
		"Dublin and Ireland are the closest you're going to get to London and the UK," says Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the inward investment agency, pointing to the English language, common laws and a skilled workforce. Industry leaders say the fact that Dublin already has an established finance industry - it has grown from nothing to employ 30,000 people in 25 years - is one of its key advantages.
		Dublin's biggest selling point may be that it is about 40 per cent cheaper than London for financial services groups, says Kieran Donoghue, head of international financial services at the IDA. Still, he says the scarcity of high-quality homes is "a pinch point".
		Alongside the likes of Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin is a long list of upstart challengers. These include locations that might not be obvious bases for glamorous "front-office" roles, but have nonetheless already drawn large numbers of backroom jobs from the City.
		Poland has quietly but rapidly become a big "nearshoring" location. More than 50,000 people are now employed by global banks there. "Nearshoring to Poland is only going to grow even further after Brexit," says Wojciech Poplawski, who heads Accenture's service centre operations in Warsaw. "There's EU access and competitive costs. It's a no-brainer."
		At the same time, locations outside Europe may also become more appealing. For banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase or HSBC, lawyers believe Brexit may be the trigger to shift some business to Asia or the US.
		'No perfect clusters'  For most banks, insurers and asset managers, the response to the rival pitches is unlikely to be straightforward. "It isn't obvious that you try to replicate London where you have everything in one city," says one senior UK-based banker. "Everywhere has deficiencies, nowhere is a perfect cluster like London," says another, describing French labour law as a "disaster".
		Instead, groups are expected to disburse employees around the region, depending on office capacity, existing licences and staff preferences. JPMorgan, for example, has licences in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin and may upgrade other locations such as Paris to fully fledged operations.
		"If we move roles to Europe, we have the option of distributing them across several locations," says one bank insider. "Not all our competitors do."
		Richard Gnodde, co-head of Goldman Sachs' international operations, headquartered in London, told a business summit in London this week: "If passporting was totally removed, we would have to adjust our footprint and where people were located." Goldman has a banking licence for its Frankfurt operation, which includes a small number of staff in securities sales and trading, making the city the most likely destination for any activities moved out of the UK. Goldman is also weighing other options such as Dublin and Amsterdam.
		The British banks facing the greatest disruption from any loss of passporting rights are Barclays and HSBC, which have the largest investment banking operations in the City dealing with clients from the continent. Barclays says it has an investment banking licence in Dublin. HSBC executives point to its sizeable trading floors in both Paris and Düsseldorf. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive, said before the vote that it may move as many as 1,000 jobs to Paris if the Leave campaign won. Among non-banks, fund manager M&amp;G has already decided to launch a new range of funds based in Ireland rather than the UK.
		Unless there is rapid political manoeuvring to reverse the process of Brexit, there is one certainty - parts of the City of London's fabric will soon start to unravel. But amid all the panic and jostling for business, there are those who sit back and say shrinkage may be no bad thing.
		A senior banker, who has large operations in London and Paris, takes a big-picture view. "The overconcentration of financial services in London and in the UK has done big societal damage, as the financial crisis demonstrated," he says. "It may be no bad thing for everyone if there is some redistribution across a number of other financial centres. If 50,000 out of 500,000 jobs move from the City to Paris or Frankfurt, so what?"

<titre>Euronext on the alert for merger fallout  Interview: Stéphane Boujnah</titre>
<auteur>By Michael Stothard in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		Stéphane Boujnah , the chief executive of pan-European exchange Euronext, refuses to be left out of the consolidation that is shaking up his industry.
		In the middle of a proposed $30bn mega-merger between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse to create an European exchange group to rival those in the US and Asia, he has his own card to play.  With Euronext's strong cash generation and low debt, "we will be able to move very quickly for very significant targets if opportunities come up", he says in his office in <mention id="2176">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="2177">the Paris business district</mention>.
		"There are independent exchanges in the eurozone that may want to reconsider their future," says the 52-year-old former Santander banker who took the helm at Euronext in November. "They may want to be part of a pan-European exchange group where they can still keep their identity but grow at the same time."
		Euronext, which was spun out of Intercontinental Exchange of the US in an initial public offering in 2014, runs bourses in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The remaining independents in the region include Madrid, Luxembourg and Vienna.
		Others potential targets include any exchanges that have to be sold to win regulatory approval for the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal, which is expected to close at the start of next year.
		"Some assets might be sold [as part of the deal], and some of those assets might be interesting to look at," he says.
		Analysts point to the LSE's 57 per cent stake in LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for derivative and bond trades, and Deutsche Börse's ownership of Clear-stream, one of the region's biggest settlement houses.
		Large deals are not the core of Euro-next's three-year strategy, however. Its official plan, outlined in May, is to grow "quasi-organically", investing €100m to €150m by 2019 to diversify away from its core equity strength. The group wants to grow in areas such as data analytics, exchange traded funds, open-source indices and commodities.
		Euronext plans to increase revenue about 5 per cent a year and increase group operating margins from 57 per cent - one of the highest in Europe - to between 61 and 63 per cent by 2019.
		Mr Boujnah says the group cannot just be "more efficient", however. "When you are small, you can be agile, and you must be agile . . . The conditions are there for us to be able to use our balance sheet to react very quickly."
		An interest in larger deals comes in part because Euronext, with a market value of about €2.4bn, is four times smaller than LSE and Deutsche Börse. The expected merger would make Euronext a minnow in Europe.
		Mr Boujnah stresses that the LSE-Deutsche Börse combination is far from done. "All I can say is that the last 20 years show that these transformational deals always take a lot longer than expected and never turn out as initially anticipated."
		He highlights some of the potential hurdles. "The Deutsche Börse shareholders, the LSE shareholders, the European Commission, the prudential supervisors and various other regulators in Germany all need to sign off on this. Anything can happen."
		Careful not to criticise the deal itself, he says there could be competition issues creating a trading group some 10 times the size of Euronext, its next largest competitor in Europe.
		The planned combination of LCH and Eurex Clearing "is essentially combining two banks", Mr Boujnah says, and so could raise "too big to fail issues".
		There is also the risk that the value of the two companies will change, particularly after this week's referendum on whether or not the UK will remain in the EU, he says.
		"It is always difficult to deliver any paper deal a year from closing, let alone with Brexit in the middle."
		His carefully chosen words belie the intense lobbying that is going on in France against the British-German deal.
		Last month Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said he wanted to "express the concern of the French government on this tie-up . . . We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe".
		If a deal goes ahead, says Mr Boujnah, it will not change his core strategy. "They [LSE and Deutsche Börse] will focus on being a global player in indices, derivatives and post-trade," he says.
		Euronext's focus in on profitability, strengthening the core business, and to "focus on financing the real economy in Europe", he says.

		In the Middle Ages, the residents of the inhospitable, low-lying bog, where present-day Amsterdam stands, were forced to co-operate to survive. Overcoming differences in lifestyle and religion in favour of common interest, they teamed up and built dykes to keep the sea out of the "polder", as the land behind was called.  This early social co-operation resulted in the Dutch word  poldermodel  , meaning consensus decision-making, and is often credited as the basis for the city's famous liberalism and tolerance. "The Netherlands owes its existence to a democracy of dry feet," is how Dutch writer Herman Pleij put it. Amsterdam's progressive spirit has certainly helped to give this small city cosmopolitan appeal, which continues to draw international investors today.
		Which is handy because, since the vote for Brexit, several EU cities have been lining up to challenge London as the capital of European finance. According to the New York Times - which rated factors including infrastructure, office space, cultural offerings and the prevalence of the English language - Amsterdam is in pole position.
		Some tech companies have already set up bases in the city - WeTransfer, Booking.com and TomTom - but time will tell if the country's cap of 20 per cent of salary on bankers' bonuses introduced last year will deter some financial institutions from relocating.
		If top earners do relocate, they will find a property market in bullish mood. In the past 18 months, house prices have surged thanks to the economic recovery of the Netherlands, and a shortage of housing stock, as well as low interest rates of about 2 per cent. Prices dropped 15 per cent after the 2008 financial crisis, but have now overtaken pre-crisis levels and are setting new records in the best areas, according to several agents.
		House prices in Amsterdam rose 17 per cent in 2015, according to figures released by the Dutch Association of Estate Agents and Valuers. It has been a rapid rise, says Leslie de Ruiter of Christie's International Real Estate, which recently sold a 1,450 sq metre apartment for €16m. "In the best parts of Amsterdam we are exploring new highs in terms of property prices," he says, with a quarter of sales now above €1m.
		The best parts of the city are now 5 or 6 per cent above 2008 prices, according to Barbara Van der Grijp of Engel &amp; Volkers. The agency recently set a new record price in the city of €22,000 per sq metre after selling a house for €8m.
		Bidding above the asking price is becoming the norm, she says. "There can be 50 people at every viewing and 10 bids." A former museum, converted into an 18-bedroom mixed-use property, that the agency sold 18 months ago for €7.5m is back on the market for €15m.
		In some cases international investors, primarily from the US and UK, are buying a second home to use as a European pied-à-terre. "People come on holiday, see the old city and fall in love. Amsterdam makes every top 10 list for happiness and quality of life," she says.
		Engel &amp; Volkers is selling an 18thcentury canal house with a patio garden for €10m. The six-bedroom property features original stucco, marble and woodcarving, and has a basement pool.
		There are signs however that the market may be overheating, with insufficient new supply to meet demand. The number of sales in the first quarter of 2016 fell 2 per cent year on year.
		However, the city is still cheap compared with Düsseldorf, Paris and London, says Gaby Balkema of Dutch agency Thuis in Vastgoed. Homes rarely sell for more than €15,000 per sq metre and the country has no capital gains tax.
		Foreigners tend to buy homes on the banks of the Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Herengracht canals or in the Old South, near the Vondelpark, says Balkema, who likens the area to Chelsea in London or New York's Upper East Side. Christie's International Real Estate is marketing a six-bedroom villa next to the Vondelpark for €11.75m.
		New areas such as Zuidas, a financial district comparable with London's Canary Wharf or <mention id="2178">La Défense in Paris</mention>, are also becoming more popular.
		Hugo Lindsay, a lawyer for a technology company who moved to Amsterdam from London last year, bought a four-bedroom apartment in a historic building next to the Rijksmuseum "for the same price as a two-bedroom flat in Tooting, [south London]". Lindsay, 45, says the quality of life is "extraordinary" compared with London. "You work fewer hours and you have everything you need: culture, food, and open spaces, in a small city, which is much faster to get in and out of."
		Amsterdam still has a way to go if it is to supplant London, though. It has a population of less than 1m, fewer theatres less sporting opportunities and most shops are closed by 6pm.
		Buyers in the city centre, especially those on canals, should also be wary of subsidence. For centuries, as in Venice, houses in Amsterdam have been built on up to 20-metre-long timber piles (now often replaced with concrete), which are forced through the layers of mud and clay to reach solid ground. Foundation beams are then laid on top.
		Whether the growing demand for property in the city is founded on more solid ground remains to be seen.
		i / BUYING GUIDE
		Buyers need their own agent to help alert them to homes they wouldn't otherwise find. Yet if you do discover a property independently, they may still charge a fee
		Allow 6 per cent of the purchase price for fees and charges
		Apartment buildings are managed by an owners' association, which can be poorly run, or in debt, so check its status
		What you can buy for . . .
		€1m A two or three-bedroom apartment in the city centre
		€2m A small house in the Old South
		€4m A smart, six-bedroom canal house

<titre>Rise of the lone wolf: the lost souls seeking an ideology to help them punish the world</titre>
<auteur>What makes a murderer? By Raffaello Pantucci</auteur>
<texte>
		There is no perfect profile of a terrorist. This is one of the main findings in the growing body of literature around terrorism.
		Terrorists and those radicalised towards extremist ideologies come in all shapes and sizes. Yet, one of the key features that has appeared to distinguish terrorists from mass murderers is that they have been motivated more clearly by an ideology than by personal reasons.  Increasingly, this line is becoming harder to draw. The last two cases to afflict Europe - the massacres in Nice and Munich - highlight this difficulty, with both cases appearing to contain elements of both.
		Unfortunately it is still too early to know categorically what was going on in Nice and Munich. While the early coverage around both focused on the fact that the Nice murderer was operating alone, and the speculation around the Munich shooter that he may have been motivated by some violent Islamist ideology, instead we are now seeing confusing indicators of other directions.
		French authorities have arrested five others in connection with the Nice attack, while it appears the Munich shooter may have had a fixation with mass shootings and was probably inspired more by Anders Breivik than Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
		But what both cases appear to have in common is disturbed young men who are angry at the world around them. In both cases, stories have emerged of potentially confused sexuality, confused religious identity, anger management issues and family disputes. Rather than being ideologically committed terrorists, they may simply have used the method of a terrorist attack - under whatever ideology - to excise personal demons. This appears to be an increasingly common phenomenon.
		It is difficult to know exactly why this is happening. Certainly, the phenomenon of "lone wolf " terrorists is on the increase and groups such as Isil and al-Qaeda have urged their adherents to adopt this methodology for some time. But in many of these cases it is not clear the lone wolves have totally bought into the ideology they claim to be fighting for.
		Man Haron Monis, the Australian-Iranian who held up a coffee shop in Sydney in 2014, was only a recent convert to Sunni Islam and brought the wrong flag with him to his allegedly Isil-inspired attack. Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 50 at an Orlando nightclub, apparently claimed some allegiance to al-Qaeda, Hizbollah and Isil - competing groups.
		But it is possible the noise surrounding groups such as Isil is drawing lost souls towards it. It is almost impossible to turn on the television without hearing about Isil, terrorism or political violence. If you are a socially awkward individual with violent tendencies and are seeking some sort of meaning in your life, then the methodology of a lone wolf spree under the banner of such a group may be appealing. It will provide you with a way to punish the world around you while also giving meaning to your act.
		Given the manner in which Isil and other groups push out their message of violence and offer a very low bar for entry, it is very easy to latch on to the ideology - as you may loosely understand it.
		There is also a copycat element to such attacks. This is nothing new - the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013 by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale has generated numerous copycat incidents. The same week, Alexandre Dhaussy, a recent convert to Islam and known to authorities more for his petty crime than his violent Islamist links, stabbed soldier Cédric Cordier in <mention id="2179">La Défense in Paris</mention>.
		In August 2014, Brusthom Ziamani, a young man who had fallen into the orbit of violent extremists after he was thrown out of his family home, was arrested on his way to carry out an attack emulating the Rigby murder.
		In January 2015, Zack Davies launched a machete attack on an Asian man at a Tesco in Wales while shouting "white power", saying it was to avenge Rigby. Later investigation showed Davies was an isolated, paranoid young man who was obsessed with the far Right and claimed to have been inspired by Jihadi John videos.
		The profile of what we consider a terrorist attack is increasingly hard to define, in the same way that the specifics of what terrorists look like is ever harder to grasp. Fundamentally, a terrorist is someone motivated by a political ideology rather than personal anger - but this line is becoming blurred. The profile of the average terrorist is melding with that of a mass killer, presenting authorities with an almost impossible task to prevent every attack.

<titre>Investors braced for tide to turn</titre>
<auteur>By Judith Evans</auteur>
<texte>
		Global real estate has enjoyed two plentiful years - attracting $700bn in direct investment in 2015 and slightly more the year before, not far from the record $758bn achieved in 2007, according to the Chicago-based estate agency JLL.
		But 2016 began with equity and bond markets in turmoil, while prices for buildings in key office centres such as London and New York have been coming off record highs. That left the industry with one question to answer: has the market peaked?  "The bloom has come off the rose a bit in terms of real estate valuations," says Jon Zehner, global head of client capital group at LaSalle Investment Management, one of the world's largest real estate fund managers. "The prime market in gateway cities needed to stabilise - it was getting too hot. This could be an appropriate correction. A period of more stable values and maybe a little less passion in the market is what we're envisioning for the year."
		Elisabeth Troni, global real estate strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management, says the company's indicators show "late cycle risks" and it predicts that values will fall in 2016, with the UK market "flat to declining". But she adds: "We're not foreseeing a crash."
		A crucial question is the direction of investor appetite. A wave of institutional capital has surged into real estate over the past two years, driven by the search for returns.
		That capital has increasingly crossed borders and continents: 20 per cent of real estate deals in 2015 were cross-border, according to Savills. It has also helped to push values up for income-generating "alternative" real estate, such as student accommodation.
		Yet according to research late last year by Hodes Weill, the real estate advisers, and Cornell University, institutions remain "significantly underinvested" in property, by an average 110 basis points compared to their own targets.
		Property investments are still able to offer more income than other asset classes, which is one of their key selling points. Even US offices, one of the most highly priced sectors in the world, offer a 370 basis point premium over yields from 10-year government bonds, according to figures from Green Street Advisors.
		Axa Investment Managers has just raised €500m for a new core real estate fund and has ambitions to expand the vehicle to €5bn. Its launch was driven by growing allocations from pension funds, especially in the Nordics and Benelux region, says Isabelle Scemama, global head of real asset finance.
		On the other hand, says Mr Zehner at LaSalle, drops in bond and equity values mean some institutions in the UK, US and Australia are reducing their property holdings this year to stay within fixed allocation boundaries.
		As the oil price remains low and China's markets weak, an important question is whether the Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and Asian corporates that have been snapping up big-ticket assets will remain active.
		So far, the signals are mixed. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's second-largest sovereign wealth fund, acquired <meronyme id="2181">the planned Tour Alto</meronyme> office development in <mention id="2182">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> in February, a sign of continued activity in the market.
		However, Walter Boettcher, director of research and forecasting at Colliers, the estate agency, says: "There are clear signs that continued low oil prices will impact oil sovereign strategies, especially when combined with other market events."
		Malaysian funds have been selling overseas real estate assets over the past year to repatriate capital as their home country suffers from the oil slump.
		Within east Asia, market turmoil does not so far appear to have hurt demand for real estate: investment volumes into Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese property were up 47 per cent, 66 per cent and 18 per cent respectively in 2015 from a year earlier, according to JLL. Chinese investment into Europe meanwhile appears to be on the increase, says Mr Boettcher - though Asian investors are switching their focus to continental Europe from the highly-priced UK.
		"A lot of the money coming out of China to invest in real estate is not institutional. It's corporates or ultra-high-net-worth [individuals]," says Mr Zehner. "The volatility and depreciation in the renminbi have actually seemed to encourage them to invest outside of China - they are looking for stability, diversification and more stable currencies, at least for now."
		Agents expect significant new flows from Japan. There Japan Post Bank - which has a $500bn investment fund - has said it aims to divert more cash into global risk assets including real estate. At least two other major Japanese institutions are also looking to expand their overseas property holdings, said Richard DiVall, head of cross-border capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Colliers.
		Investors' first concern remains the level of demand for buildings on the ground. In developed markets, banks' unwillingness to lend for speculative development has led to much tighter supply than in the last cycle, say analysts, as well as less financial risk.
		They point to a bright spot in Australia , where real estate on the country's east coast has suffered less than expected from the commodities slump. "The office markets and labour markets have surprised repeatedly in recent months. The markets had been preparing for a downturn but they have been positively surprised on net income growth," says Ms Troni of Aberdeen Asset Management.
		Private equity investors are meanwhile turning their attention to Italy, where the government is moving to improve private investors' opportunities to profitably access non-performing real estate loans , while economic recovery there has also drawn the attention of sovereign wealth funds, which have been buying up Milan property.
		For "higher-octane returns", La Salle is looking to the US and Asia, seeing opportunities for bargains driven by distressed sellers bitten by Chinese economic and market turbulence.
		On a broader scale, demographics are driving up interest in residential property. This segment's share of overall investment in the property market has almost doubled to 18 per cent since the downturn, according to Savills.
		Homes for millennials in developed economies and the middle class in emerging countries are seen as profitable plays on long-term trends, as are the warehouse sites that cater for their online shopping.
		In the shorter term, Mr Boettcher argues "it is too soon to declare an end to the bull market" in commercial property. From New York to Shanghai, investors will be hoping he is right.

<titre>London rivals struggle to prepare for Brexit fallout</titre>
<auteur>By Judith Evans</auteur>
<texte>
		Welcome to FrankfurtRheinMain," declares a website set up by the German region, which went live after the UK voted to leave the EU. It offers a 24-hour UK-based hotline for companies thinking of opening an office in the area.  Frankfurt is one of several major European cities to have launched a charm offensive since the June referendum, aiming to lure businesses - especially financial services - that are reassessing their UK presence after the Brexit vote. Paris's financial regulator is offering fast-track registration; Dublin has caught the eye of one of the continent's largest stock exchanges, Bats Europe, as a possible location for a second headquarters.
		Red carpets are being rolled out all over Europe. But cities seeking to attract large departments of blue-chip businesses must also provide something more practical: office space.
		Matthew Fitzgerald, head of European tenant representation at Savills, says that immediately after the Brexit vote in June, phones began ringing at his company with a series of requests for data - office rents in Dublin, living costs in Frankfurt, property taxes in Paris.
		"A lot of heads of real estate at banks received directives from the top: 'If we had to do an emergency move, what is it going to cost us?'" he says.
		In some respects, the answers were reassuring. Occupying an office in another European city is generally far cheaper than in London: top-grade office space in the UK capital costs $243 per square foot per year, including rent, service charges and taxes, while a square foot in Paris is $90 a year and, in Dublin, $76, Savills says. Frankfurt and Amsterdam come in even cheaper, at $55 and $53 respectively.
		But this does not tell the whole story. No other European city can rival London's prime office stock, built up thanks to its position as the continent's main financial centre. Vacancy rates across the continent's major cities, meanwhile, are at their lowest rates for a decade, while developers - still bruised from the debt-fuelled building boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis - have been slower to construct new office buildings, leading to a shortage of space.
		When it comes to potential relocations, the UK's financial sector is a particular focus, because both overseas and UK companies make use of "passporting" rights under the EU's single market to sell products into other EU countries. If passporting ends, investment banks such as Morgan Stanley say they will move parts of their London operations on to the continent. Other groups have said they may shift operations pre-emptively as Brexit negotiations will take at least two years.
		Should a bank seek office space immediately for 2,000 people in <mention id="2183">the central business district of a European city</mention>, they would currently find eight options in Paris, all in <mention id="2184">La Défense</mention> in the west central area of the city, according to Savills research.
		In Frankfurt, five such spaces are currently available, while another one to three are expected to come on the market in the next two years.
		Madrid, Dublin and Amsterdam each offer a single option, and in Amsterdam that building is still under development. "I am sure the number would be reduced further if we were to define specific requirements with a bank," says Mr Fitzgerald. Any of these options would require a 10-year lease agreement, he added, making them unsuitable for short-term arrangements.
		More spaces are available if a company is only looking to relocate 1,000 staff: in Paris, for example, some 16 deals for offices of this size have been done in the past two years. The French capital has the largest overall office stock of any European capital outside London, and a vacancy rate of 7 per cent compared with London rates varying between 3.2 and 5.2 per cent across the West End, City and Canary Wharf.
		If companies take action to move to another European jurisdiction, that could spur new office development, but only if they are prepared to sign pre-let agreements on new space, agents say.
		Dublin, with its proximity to London, low corporation tax, links with the US and English-speaking population, has been a particular focus of interest, says Mr Fitzgerald. Nick Coveney, director of business space at Colliers in Dublin, says he is working with a London-based boutique financial consultancy looking to set up a base in the city ahead of Brexit negotiations to secure their EU foothold. "They want the absolute premier office space in Dublin," he says.
		Companies are assessing other factors beyond property: rates of corporate and other tax, salaries, regulation, the ease of recruiting workers and the potential or otherwise to persuade senior staff to relocate to a given city.
		Housing for staff is another concern: "In Dublin we have a shortage of very high-end housing within a relatively easy commute of the city," says Marie Hunt, executive director for Ireland at the property advisers CBRE. "A lot of work is going into improving that, but there isn't sufficient housing today."
		High housing costs will result in pressures on salaries and allowances paid out by companies. In Dublin, Amsterdam and Brussels, 90 per cent of the total cost of relocating new workers to the cities can be taken up by subsidising their initial housing arrangements, according to Savills.
		Despite the initial flurry of inquiries, most companies are waiting to find out at least the parameters of Brexit negotiations before proceeding, agents say. "Most people are doing their homework now and will make decisions over the next two years," says Ms Hunt.
		For those that do move staff, no consensus destination has emerged so far, says Mr Fitzgerald. "Given that there is still no obvious successor to London, it's likely that it could take several years to see a financial of cluster of a similar scale. It would be fair assumption for banks to spread their workforce given business requirements."

<titre>France sets up team in push to lure businesses from London  Brexit</titre>
<auteur>By Michael Stothard in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		France will this week step up efforts to attract business from London in the wake of the Brexit vote by appointing a team of corporate leaders and politicians to drive the campaign.
		Ross McInnes, an Oxford-educated Franco-Australian and chairman of Safran, the French engine-maker, is to be named the "ambassador" who will head efforts to lure UK-based companies to Paris, say people familiar with the decision.  Valérie Pécresse, centre-right president of the greater Paris region, and Anne Hildago, Paris's socialist mayor, will also be heavily involved in a sign that the initiative has cross-party support.
		An important focus will be attracting financial companies that are likely to be among the worst affected by the decision to leave the EU if they lose their "passporting" rights to operate across the bloc. Some banks, such as HSBC, have already signalled that they could move jobs to Paris.
		But the team will also target companies in the industrial, mining, energy and broader service sectors as they look at any businesses that chose to be based in the UK because of its EU membership, people close to the discussions say.
		Setting up the team is the latest step in a multipronged approach adopted by France as several European states compete to attract any businesses that decide to move part or all of their operations from the UK.
		Immediately after the June 23 referendum, President François Hollande's Socialist government changed the tax rules for expatriates in Paris to make it more generous.
		"We want to build the financial capital of the future . . . now is the time to come to France," Manuel Valls, French prime minister, said in July.
		In September, French financial regulators said they were simplifying the process of registering new financial companies in Paris, in part by allowing documents to be filed in English. They said this came "in the context of the Brexit vote".
		<mention id="2185">Paris's La Défense business district</mention> this month unveiled an advertising campaign aimed at capitalising on the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, with the slogan: " Tired of the fog? Try the frogs! ".
		There have also been discussions between French business groups and the government about introducing a special labour code for financial workers, in effect making it easier to hire and fire them than other workers in France.
		The inflexibility of the French labour code, along with high taxes, is one of the main reasons some financial groups say they will be reluctant to move to Paris . The idea of a special rule for finance workers has been ruled out, mainly on constitutional grounds. "We cannot have a specific status for jobs in the financial sector," Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said last week.
		Senior UK-based bankers are doubtful French politicians will propose any big sweeteners to attract business from the UK before next year's presidential election. One banker who had been lobbied by the French said he viewed any French promises with scepticism because its parliament recently voted to strengthen its financial transaction tax.

<titre>MASTERMIND OF TERROR KILLED IN GUN BATTLE; PARIS ATTACKS: THE AFTERMATH.</titre>
<auteur>nan</auteur>
<texte>
		THE suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks who was killed during a dramatic police shoot-out was linked to four foiled terror plots in France this year, the country's interior minister has said.
		Bernard Cazeneuve said French authorities had no information that Islamic State (IS) jihadist Abdelhamid Abaaoud was in France before last Friday's massacre which left 129 dead. Abaaoud, 27, died with his cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen who blew herself up following a major pre-dawn raid in the northern suburb of Saint-Denis on Wednesday. His body was identified based on his fingerprints.  Mr Cazeneuve told a press conference that the French government was only informed by an intelligence service "outside of Europe" of Abaaoud's whereabouts on Monday.
		The jihadist from Belgium had returned from Syria in 2014 and had been involved in four of six foiled attacks in France since spring 2015, he added.
		The French interior minister said the six failed plots were all planned from abroad with the intention that they would be carried out by jihadists living in Europe.
		A suspected terrorist had confessed while under arrest that he had been trained by Abaaoud to carry out a "violent attack" in France or another European country, he added "It is urgent for Europe to come together, organise and defend itself against the terrorist threat," Mr Cazeneuve said.
		A French official said Aitboulahcen - believed to be the first female suicide bomber to hit Western Europe - detonated a suicide vest after a brief exchange with police officers.
		According to the official, one of the officers asked: "Where is your boyfriend?" and she responded angrily: "He's not my boyfriend!" before there was an explosion.
		The bodies recovered in the raid were badly mangled, with part of the woman's spine landing on a police car, complicating formal identification.
		Eight people were arrested following the raid which saw police fire about 5,000 rounds of ammunition as the terrorist cell barricaded themselves in the hideout.
		Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said the operation neutralised a "new terrorist threat", and that "everything led us to believe that, considering their armaments, the structured organisation and their determination, they were ready to act".
		The jihadis were set to carry out a second attack after Friday's massacre, this time targeting Charles de Gaulle airport and <mention id="2186">the city's financial district La Defense</mention>, according to reports.
		Salah Abdeslam, one of the suspected gunmen from Friday's attacks who is now the focus of an international manhunt, was not among those arrested, the prosecutor added.
		Belgian authorities yesterday launched six raids in the Brussels region linked to Bilal Hadfi, one of the suicide bombers outside the Stade de France.
		Meanwhile, French prime minister Manuel Valls warned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons, and urged an extension of France's state of emergency.
		He said: "Terrorism hit France, not because of what it is doing in Iraq and Syria ... but for what it is.
		"We know that there could also be a risk of chemical or biological weapons."
		Belgian police are also reportedly searching for a man named Mohamed K, from Roubaix, northern France, who is suspected of supplying the terrorist gang with explosives.
		The eight arrested included one woman and a man whose flat was used as a hideout by the terror cell and are being interrogated.
		Meanwhile, dozens of youngsters have called a UK children's helpline with fears that they will be victims of terrorist attacks following the Paris massacres last week.
		NSPCC's ChildLine reported more than 100 calls from children as young as nine who told counsellors they feared something was going to happen to them, were frightened to leave the house, and struggled to think of anything else.
		Some even said they feared the world was on the brink of a third world war.
		One 12-year-old girl told a ChildLine counsellor: "I have heard that Isis are in the UK and are planning a deadly attack. I don't feel safe any more and am having nightmares. These worries are in my mind all the time and I can't get them out."
		For some the issue is even more personal as a number of children from ethnic communities said they had been bullied following the attacks, with some even being told to "join Isis" - the terrorist group responsible for the weekend attacks.
		A 17-year-old girl told a counsellor: "I am scared to go to college tomorrow because of racist repercussions following events in Paris over the weekend. "People judge me because I am Muslim and go to mosque. I feel everyone thinks I am a terrorist even though I disagree with terrorist actions.
		"I wear a hijab and have suffered racist comments most of my life but when something like this happens you just want to hide."
		NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: "The attacks in Paris were atrocious, and our thoughts are with all of those who have been affected by these hideous attacks on innocent lives.
		"The avalanche of calls to ChildLine about this tragedy only adds to the feelings of fear and sadness that these evil attacks have prompted around the world. Many of the victims were young people and that will have heightened the fears of those who have seen others their age brutally murdered. "It is crucial that children can talk about their feelings following these senseless killings, and are given reassurance and support."
		Elsewhere in Europe, jittery leaders and law enforcement moved to protect their citizens as Rob Wainwright, director of the European Union's police co-ordination agency Europol, warned of "a very serious escalation" of the terror threat in Europe.
		In Italy, foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni said law enforcement was searching for five people flagged by the FBI in response to a US warning about potential targets following the Paris attacks. The US state department issued a warning on Wednesday that St Peter's Basilica in Rome, Milan's cathedral and La Scala opera house, as well as churches, synagogues, restaurants, theatres and hotels, had been identified as "potential targets".
		Danish and Norwegian police were asked to be on the lookout for a man who Swedish authorities said is wanted in connection with an investigation into "preparing for a terrorist offence". Sweden's security service, known as SAPO, said the request was not linked to the Paris attacks.
		In Belgium, where many of the Paris attackers lived, prime minister Charles Michel announced a package of additional anti-terror measures, and said 400 million euro (PS280 million) would be earmarked to expand the fight.
		Mr Michel told politicians that security personnel will be increased and special attention will be paid to eradicating messages of hate.

<titre>Leaving London: voices from financial front line speak of foreign attractions  Fewer than 1,500 jobs have shifted to Europe since the referendum but European banking hubs hope to lure many more</titre>
<auteur>FT REPORTERS</auteur>
<texte>
		In the 33 months since the UK voted to leave the EU, thousands of financial services companies with European hubs in London have been assessing their options.
		Many of them have concluded that the potential disruption of Brexit means they need to expand elsewhere in the EU, anticipating the loss of passporting rights that permit them to access clients across Europe.  Financial Times research published last week found that the City of London's biggest international banks have moved fewer than 1,500 jobs from the UK in the run-up to Brexit, far fewer than originally estimated in many quarters.
		While relatively few people have shifted so far, rivals to London's crown as Europe's financial centre have been jostling to attract more Brexit escapers. Yet even the trickle of new arrivals is stirring concern about upward pressure on property prices and extra competition for places at international schools. The FT has spoken to people in six of the cities affected by these moves — Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Milan and Madrid — to hear how Brexit is playing out.
		Paris Stefano Petricca, pictured below, remembers where he was when he realised that his fledgling London-based asset manager would have to pack its bags and head to the continent.
		"I was watching the referendum on local TV ... I immediately understood that it was going the wrong way — immediately," he said in Paris while setting up his new life.
		The 53-year-old Italian native is the founder and chief executive of Petricca &amp; Co Capital, a €700m asset manager, which he set up in London four years ago.
		To guard against the potential disruption of Brexit, he started planning a move to the continent as soon as the referendum result landed.
		He fired a handful of staff and uprooted his life, writing off the cost of obtaining UK licences.
		He chose Paris because of its top cultural attractions, as well as its established financial market infrastructure and its close travel links to London.
		His move to the French capital has been mirrored at larger banks and asset managers, with Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and a host of others shifting operations there. They were lured to Paris in part by a low-tax offer made by French president Emmanuel Macron.
		"We have seen an acceleration of teams being moved to Paris ... there is still uncertainty and people are still waiting, but the plans are there and the first teams have been put in place," said Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, a French business lobby group that estimates some 20,000 jobs are shifting there from London.
		The moves are pushing up property prices and fuelling competition for scarce places at the city's best international schools. "We were able to increase the number of school places in Paris by 1,000 to close to 11,500," said Charline Avenel, who administers four major school districts around Paris, including Versailles.
		"The planning began two years ago, after the referendum," said Ms Avenel, pointing to a new school with an international section opening at Courbevoie near <mention id="2187">the business district of La Défense</mention> that has guaranteed school places to the European Banking Authority's staff as it moves from London to Paris.
		Prime office space in the centre of Paris is also already scarce, with Brexit only adding to the pressure. "In the most sought-after areas of Paris the vacancy rates are at a record low of 1.7 per cent," said Philippe Perello, a Paris partner with Knight Frank.
		The same is true for high-end apartments. "There is a scarcity in the market ... in the classic arrondissements, like the 16th, with a good stock of Haussmannian apartments, some with gardens, and close to the good schools, prices have jumped by over 5 per cent since Brexit," said Marie-Hélène Lundgreen, who works at Belles Demeures specialising in luxury real estate. She has been inundated recently with requests from bankers moving from London to Paris.
		Mr Petricca is searching for an apartment in Paris and although he "prays for a second referendum" his own move is now set in stone. "You know why; because I had to start to prepare lawyers and accountants to move one year ago." David Keohane in Paris Frankfurt In the coffee shops and bars of Frankfurt's financial district that surrounds the city's old opera house, talk of Brexit has been drowned out by a different, yet equally contested topic: the merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.
		Both banks have their headquarters in the German city, and they are expected to sack tens of thousands of employees if the deal goes ahead.
		In the long run, Brexit is likely to affect Frankfurt more fundamentally than Deutsche's potential absorption of Commerzbank. But for now, little has changed in the sleepy city of 730,000.
		Since the Brexit vote in 2016, more than 45 financial institutions have set up or beefed up their presence in Germany, the vast majority of them choosing Frankfurt — including the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered.
		"Frankfurt is the first choice for Brexit banks," said Gertrud Traud, chief economist of Frankfurt-based Helaba, a state-owned bank that is tracking the process closely.
		The total assets banks hold in the city are expected to rise by more than a fifth this year as they relocate several hundreds of billions of euros from London. The clearing volume of euro-denominated derivatives such as interest rate swaps — close to zero when Britain voted to leave the EU — has jumped more than tenfold last year alone.
		For now, lenders are only moving "the bare minimum" of jobs from London to Frankfurt that they need to satisfy regulators, said Joachim Wuermeling, a Bundesbank board member.
		"There will be a second wave, but at the moment it is very difficult to assess how big it will be."
		Most banks have been hiring locally for any extra jobs in Frankfurt.
		"We have a number of employees ready to move instantly in a hard Brexit situation, but so far almost no one has made the plunge," said a Frankfurtbased employee at a large US investment bank.
		Germany's financial capital, which lacks London's global buzz or Paris' cultural flair, has done little to woo banks. Mayor Peter Feldmann, a left-of-centre Social Democrat, avoids the sector.
		The federal government in Berlin has, however, promised to make it easier for banks to fire highly paid senior staff.
		While partly driven by Brexit, the boom in Frankfurt's commercial and residential real estate market is mainly caused by low interest rates and a strong local economy outside of banking.
		Residential rents are up 58 per cent since 2014, and commercial rents for premium office space in prime locations were up 7.3 per cent last year alone, according to BNP Paribas Real Estate.
		Expectations of tens of thousands of extra finance jobs have been scaled back. Helaba's latest estimate is that by the end of next year, Brexit will have pushed the staff employed by foreign banks up by 2,000 to about 4,500. Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt Dublin was in the grip of an acute financial crisis when Barry Mangan left the Irish capital for London a decade ago. By the time the JPMorgan Chase executive returned last year, the Irish capital was booming again and set for an influx of Brexit bankers.
		Mr Mangan, who is in his mid-30s, is chief risk officer at JPMorgan's payments unit in Dublin's docklands financial centre. His own move was not directly linked to Brexit. But it came as concern grew that an influx of bankers would squeeze both property and school spaces.
		Data from IDA Ireland, the state investment agency, suggests that Brexit-related projects will create more than 5,000 jobs in an already accelerating economy.
		Although Mr Mangan had heard "horror stories" about Dublin's hot housing market, he and his wife managed to buy a home after six months.
		"It took some time, but nothing crazy," he said.
		Dozens of companies have already made Dublin their EU hub as the UK prepares to leave the bloc, and this shows no sign of slowing down.
		EY, the accountancy firm, reports that 28 financial services groups have committed to relocate staff or operations to Dublin since the 2016 referendum. Among them are Citigroup, Bank of America, Barclays, Legal &amp; General and Axa.
		More than 100 companies have sought Central Bank of Ireland authorisation to operate in the country and IDA Ireland said 70 new investments are linked directly to Brexit, many outside the financial sector.
		Yet John McCartney, research director with estate agents Savills Ireland, said many companies were setting up in Dublin with only small teams.
		"They're finding out about the city, seeing how the land lies ... If the need arises, they will be in a position to scale up," he pointed out.
		William Tighe, a director with Dwellworks, a specialist international relocation agency, reported a "sustained uplift" in business due to Brexit, adding that the rise in "actionable relocations" has been in the thousands.
		Places are scarce in Irish state schools, leaving many people to turn to fee-paying institutions. "We're seeing more placements into private schools and the international schools as a result of these transferees coming in," said Mr Tighe.
		Rents are expensive, with prices in the swishest Dublin suburbs on a par with London or Paris. But the surging house price inflation that took hold after the crash has eased. Residential prices rose 5.6 per cent in the year to January, slowing from 11.8 per cent in the previous 12 months.
		Mr Mangan added he was glad to be back in Dublin, saying that non-Irish colleagues who have moved to the city are "generally very pleasantly surprised" at "how vibrant it is and how lively it is".
		Arthur Beesley in Dublin Bye-bye to Britain Dutch, Italian and Spanish cities also in mix for people exiting UK For Harm Bots, the new head of Royal Bank of Scotland's expanded Amsterdam office, one of the best things about the Dutch city is its proximity to London and other European financial hubs.
		"I can get up in Amsterdam and catch the 7 o'clock flight to London City and still be in the office by 8am, sometimes beating my colleagues who are commuting in London," said Mr Bots, who recently returned to the city he left 14 years ago after stints in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and most recently London. The new head of RBS's Dutch subsidiary NatWest Markets NV is among the hundreds of bankers leaving the UK to work for new European entities.
		Despite its benefits, including the fact that English is widely spoken, Amsterdam is unlikely to become a hub for investment banking. One factor holding it back is the rule capping bankers' bonuses at 20 per cent of fixed salary — in effect a tenth of what others earn elsewhere in the EU. Nonetheless, several trading groups — including CBOE Europe and the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise platform — have picked Amsterdam as their post-Brexit hub, as has Japanese bank MUFG.
		In Italy, hefty tax breaks by the former Renzi government have lured many Italian financiers back from London.
		Davide Serra, founder of a fastgrowing $12bn investment company in London, was an outspoken supporter of the former Renzi government. But the 48-year-old said the tax breaks were not the primary motivation behind his recent decision to move back to Milan with his family from London.
		"I have contingency plans," said Mr Serra. "I can move anyone into any major jurisdiction, depending on what Brexit turns out to be. I am hoping for the best but prepared for the worst."
		For now, his Algebris business, which specialises in banking investments and makes a third of sales from Italian clients, remains anchored in London with offices in New York, Milan, Luxembourg and Singapore.
		Sebastián Albella, head of Spain's securities regulator, has a number of theories why the trickle of post-Brexit bankers moving to Madrid has been below expectations.
		He blames a sense of instability caused by the conflict in Catalonia and a lack of tax breaks for companies such as those other countries have used to attract international banks looking to set up new EU hubs. Still, he noted that "the game is not over yet", pointing to the arrival of bankers from Credit Suisse and a number of smaller institutions.
		Credit Suisse is expected to move about 250 staff to Madrid, the largest influx of bankers into the Spanish capital, as the Swiss bank establishes an investment banking hub paired with its other main continental European base in Frankfurt.

<titre>'I want Scots to have confidence like Racing when we go out wide'  Swashbuckling: Finn Russell is enjoying a new lease of life with Racing 92Finn Russell says his club experiences in Paris can spark national team, writes Richard Bath</titre>
<auteur>Richard Bath</auteur>
<texte>
		There has never been any chance that Finn Russell might die wondering, but listening to him talking about how his time in France has changed him, you might think that before his arrival in Paris the Scotland stand-off lacked confidence and did not possess the necessary chutzpah to have a go from inside his own 22. Yet it was precisely those swashbuckling qualities which attracted Racing 92, and at their <meronyme id="2188">La Defense Arena</meronyme> he has been encouraged to play with an unfettered intent that eclipses even the licence afforded him by the famously adventurous Gregor Townsend at Glasgow Warriors.
		Although Racing believed that they were acquiring a known quantity to replace Dan Carter, they have still been astonished at Russell's virtuosity in attack, grittiness in defence and ability to bring the best out of a back line bursting with pace and guile. The Scot's ability to break defensive lines and outfox blitz defences - often while working in tandem with his main partner in crime, Simon Zebo - has been a revelation. It is a long way from seven years ago, when the 19-year-old stonemason moved from Stirling County to Falkirk for £50 a week, yet arguably Russell's great quality is that he still plays with the abandon of a teenager no matter how high the stakes.  Russell was never shackled when playing in the Pro14, but the freedom of expression that he has enjoyed in the Top 14 is something that he is determined to import into Scotland's game when their Six Nations campaign kicks off against Italy at Murrayfield on Saturday.
		"The way we play at Racing is quite open," said the stand-off. "We're throwing it around, playing quite an exciting game, quite expansive, holding on to the ball a lot and not kicking too much.
		"One thing I'm driving for with Scotland is for the boys to have more confidence when we go wide. It is hard against blitz defences but, playing in the Top 14, you get that every week - and we've managed to get outside. I'm trying to get the boys to do that, to go and back themselves to get outside, instead of playing a one-out direct style.
		"Moving to France has freshened everything up for me and there are definitely things I can bring into the Scotland side. It might be having a chat with the 13. Or it could be talking to the wingers, explaining that Zebo hangs in this position, so these are the spaces I'm looking for.
		"It may just be small things that are working for me in France, it's about understanding what I'm looking for, what they're seeing maybe a bit different. The way we're playing in France is quite out of the back, playing around teams but also playing through them."
		Russell eulogises about life in Paris. He loves playing every week and immersing himself in the club, whereas in Glasgow he always felt that the Warriors were there simply to serve the Scotland side.
		No matter who plays at inside centre this weekend - and it is possibly the biggest selection facing Scotland head coach Townsend - Russell is more convinced than ever that he can deliver a cutting edge.
		"I'm so happy and I am loving life in Paris, and that breeds confidence," he says. "I know I'm playing good rugby and that means I can back myself. When I come back, it feels different, but I feel fresher mentally. Now we need to get the job done."

<titre>Flowering ambition  Alpha architect Jean Nouvel made his name by reaching for the limits of what is possible. And his latest creation, a Qatari museum in the shape of a desert rose, does not disappoint By Caroline ROUX Photographs by Iwan BA AN</titre>
<auteur>By Caroline ROUX</auteur>
<texte>
		It's a crowded field, but Jean Nouvel is right up there when it comes to alpha-male architects. Norman Foster might fly planes made to his designs and Renzo Piano build his own boats, but the masculinity of Nouvel is defined by a menacing presence and unbridled ambition.
		 With his pale face framed by a black fedora and his jacket tailored from an especially silky black leather, the 73-year-old can appear like a cinematic villain - although his work, he says, is primarily guided by pleasure: 'The point of architecture is to develop the joy of living, to offer the sensation of discovery as well as comfort.'
		The first time we meet, it is in his Paris atelier, which was once a 19th-century workshop. It now accommodates 140 staff, working on 30 or so projects. We are sitting on Nouvel-designed chairs at a ruthlessly minimal Nouvel-designed table, and drinking coffee from cylindrical stainless-steel cups he created for Alessi. His is the 'from the spoon to the city' approach - nothing is too large or too small to warrant design. 'Architecture happens inside and outside, and at every scale,' he says.
		Nouvel, a master of the grand statement both in his words and his buildings, is admired for some triumphant turns - the exquisite transparency of the Cartier Foundation art gallery in Paris, for example, completed in 1994; or the super-celebrated Louvre Abu Dhabi, which since it opened in November 2017 has received not just critical acclaim but over a million happy visitors.
		His is the tumescent Glòries (formerly Agbar) Tower in Barcelona, his homage to Gaudí that shoots up a full 474ft above the city; and the new 443ft-high Marseillaise in - where else? - Marseilles, a patriotic shout for joy decorated in 27 shades of red, white and blue. He is such a rousing representative of his profession that Brad Pitt, architecture's biggest groupie, even named his daughter Shiloh Nouvel after him.
		At worst, he's a bit of a bully. He tried for years, from 1989 until his office went bankrupt in 1994, to build a tower in <mention id="2189">La Défense</mention> (<mention id="2190">Paris's then-new business district</mention>) so tall that it would seem to disappear into the sky - a tower, it has to be said, whose primary point was a demonstration of his genius, and that no one apart from Nouvel much wanted. In 2006, he overspent by €64 million on the ethnographic Musée du quai Branly in Paris, spoiling its conceptual excellence with a muddle of finishes and flourishes.
		 Earlier this decade, he fought long and hard to win the National Art Museum of China, which according to Nouvel will break ground in Beijing next year. He wanted it because 'it's really important for everyone. It's a renaissance for the country. It will be one of the most visited buildings in the world.' It was during the competition that he met his third wife, the 39-year-old Chinese architect Lida Guan. They live together in the 8th arrondissement with their two-year-old child. When it all gets too much, he nips offto his alternative atelier in the South of France, and lunches at his regular table at the Colombe d'Or.
		 'On the right, just after the entrance; it's the quietest spot.' Of course, at times an architect needs to put up a fight, and in London his opponent was our very own Prince of Wales. The royal architect-botherer did his best to put the dampers on One New Change, an undulating glass shopping centre completed in 2010 that honours its historic site by offering up 100 reflections of its neighbour, St Paul's Cathedral. But Nouvel was unbowed. 'I'm very proud of that building, of its stealthiness,' he says.
		Indeed, Nouvel's great talent lies in making extraordinary responses to each individual context in which he builds. 'All situations are different, from one side of the street to the other, and my interest is in looking at those differences, to create buildings that couldn't occur in any other conditions,' he says. In a world where much contemporary architecture appears to have been a product of cloning rather than design, this is a very good thing. The Louvre Abu Dhabi - with its filigree flying saucer of a roof that references the mashrabiyya latticework so fundamental to Arabic architecture - is a case in point, a building suited uniquely to its waterside location, and its function as a social and cultural magnet.
		Now, with the National Museum of Qatar, which has just opened in the capital, Doha, Nouvel has gone one better, with a building that seems to have grown out of its desert site like a flurry of tectonic flowers. As we walk beneath a shaded entrance created from the finely wrought curved blades that make up this unique architecture, I ask him how he can work in both Abu Dhabi and Qatar, regimes that are in conflict with each other. 'I don't take any sides; I have friends in both places,' he says, grandly. 'Architecture, like all the arts, occurs at a universal level. It is a way to create connections.'
		 The museum is the jewel in a crown of cultural projects initiated in Qatar by the former emir Sheikh Hamad and overseen by his daughter Sheikha Al Mayassa. Starting with the Museum of Islamic Art by the Sino-American architect IM Pei, completed in 2008, and followed by a further six institutions - three of which have opened, while three are in progress - they are intended to imbue the territory with soft power, and a reason for visitors to come here. If Dubai was going to town on sexy sun-and-sand tourism, the more conservative Qatar opted for the elegant, competitive edge of culture.
		Nouvel has built in Doha before. Another of his phallic towers glistens, thanks to its lace-like aluminium sheath (again, referencing the mashrabiyya), on the opposite side of the Corniche to the museum. 'I wanted the windows to open,' says Nouvel, 'so I created this second skin that protects the central cylinder from the wind.' When it was started in 2004 (it opened in 2012), there was nothing else on the site. Now, it's like a supermodel in a sea of mediocrity.
		While Nouvel won the National Museum project through the standard competition process, the Qataris apparently wanted the man but not his design - a wall of steel that was, according to the architect, 'like a huge land-art project'. A daintier new design was developed, based on the desert roses that are created here by nature. 'They are like small architecture,' says Nouvel of the crystalline structures formed by wind and sand. 'So I reimagined them on another scale.' The result is a 360yd-long building - comprised of clusters of these rose-like pavilions - which wraps around itself to create a central open-air piazza that Nouvel likes to call the caravanserai (the Arabian courtyards where travellers refreshed).
		 'We have left the ground as we found it,' he says, pointing to the pale gritty surface beneath our feet, where music and dance events will take place. 'It is one of the rare places in Doha that you still see the desert.' 'It's a masterpiece,' says Iwan Baan, the architectural world's most sought-after photographer, who is here to shoot the project, and who is something of an expert when it comes to what makes a building great. 'It's a complete environment in its own right; you become totally immersed in the building.' Outside, the box-fresh city of Doha, with its skyscrapers and massive road systems, throbs away, but here in the National Museum all is calm. It is a world within a world. At its heart, sits the royal family's tiny 19th-century palace, a reminder that every place has a past.
		Nouvel, who grew up in south-west France, studied architecture at the Ecole de Beaux-Arts in Paris, but it was at the feet of the maverick architect Claude Parent, a proponent of the oblique line, and the theorist Paul Virilio that he did his real learning. 'They were like my fathers,' he says. Now, while Nouvel attends to the strong concept, the contextual references, the trickle of signs and signifiers that infuse his buildings, it is up to others to work out how to keep the walls up.
		The National Museum of Qatar, says its project manager, Hafid Rakem, 'is at the very border of performance. We're right on the edge of possibility.' While Nouvel was insistent the rose blades and the tiling on their surfaces would appear in patterns that were impossible to understand, Rakem explains that the computer's role was to reduce the complexity. 'We couldn't have done it 10 years ago,' he says. Inside, the eye and the body are continually destabilised by sloping walls and floors.
		The museum's purpose is to tell the story of Qatar, a region defined by the desert and the sea, where pearl fishing first brought wealth, then was later mightily eclipsed by oil, and then liquid gas. 'But the population was nomadic and there wasn't a lot of material, so we had to create a collection by other means,' says Nouvel. 'Museology here is an open door.' (With, one imagines, unlimited budgets.) The displays, then, include objects and artefacts, but also finely wrought models and state-of-the-art films. These last, of underwater life or older Qataris recounting a different past, took five years to make and are carefully customised to be projected on to specific walls only - the screens formed by the interiors of the blades.
		'Jean wanted to create the architecture and the narrative as one,' says Sheikha Amna, a former investment banker who is the museum's director. 'The way he thinks is very metaphysical. He made sure that the relationship between the architecture and the content was seamless.' More than that, he has brought an incredible sense of place to somewhere that, perhaps until now, struggled to have one. I think Nouvel can rest assured that in this case, architecture will definitely bring comfort and joy.
		'The point of architecture is to develop the joy of living, to offer the sensation of discovery as well as comfort' Brad Pitt, architecture's biggest groupie, even named his daughter Shiloh Nouvel after him

<titre>Ad trackers on EU states' websites spark fears  Technology. Privacy threatGoogle and 100 other groups monitor citizens covertly in apparent breach of data rules</titre>
<auteur>MADHUMITA MURGIA EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT</auteur>
<texte>
		EU governments are allowing more than 100 advertising companies, including Google and Facebook, to track citizens surreptitiously across sensitive public sector websites, in apparent violation of EU data protection rules, a study has found.
		Danish browser-analysis group Cookiebot found ad trackers — which log users' locations, devices and browsing behaviour for advertisers — on the official government websites of 25 EU member states.  The French government had the highest number of ad trackers on its site, with 52 different companies tracking users' behaviour.
		Google, YouTube and DoubleClick, Google's advertising platform, accounted for three of the top five tracking domains on 22 of the main government websites.
		Researchers also studied the websites for EU public health services, finding that people seeking health advice on sensitive topics such as abortion, HIV and mental illness were met with commercial ad trackers on more than half of the sites analysed.
		Nearly three-quarters of the 15 pages scanned on the Irish health service website contained ad trackers, while 21 different companies were monitoring a single French government webpage about abortion services.
		Sixty-three trackers monitored a single German webpage about maternity leave.
		Google DoubleClick trackers were found on health pages providing information on HIV symptoms, schizophrenia and alcoholism.
		Researchers found that while many governments mentioned Google analytics cookies, which are used to run the website, in their privacy policies, they did not disclose any advertising-related cookies.
		"Any website has a responsibility to inform their user about any data collection and processing happening on their website," said Eliot Bendinelli at Privacy International. "The fact that these websites ... can't comply with this basic requirement shows that the current tracking ecosystem is out of control."
		Many commercial trackers appeared to be gaining access to these public websites through backdoor tactics, including via social sharing widgets, such as ShareThis.
		"We found that a lot of adtech trackers were smuggling in other third parties through these plug-ins, without the consent of users or knowledge of the governments themselves," said Daniel Johannsen, chief executive of Cookiebot. "Although the governments presumably do not control or benefit from the documented data collection, they still allow the ... privacy of their citizens to be compromised, in violation of the laws that they have themselves put in place."
		Experts say the personal data that adtech companies are harvesting from visitors to EU government sites could be combined with data from other sources to draw detailed profiles of each unique user, which could in turn be sold to data brokers.
		"Browsing histories are very intimate information. They show what we're worried about, what our plans are, what we are interested in, our daily routines, the focus of our work," Mr Bendinelli said. "Government websites are ... a case that's especially concerning. They offer crucial information and services that people depend on and often can't choose not to use."
		Diego Naranjo, senior policy adviser at the civil rights organisation European Digital Rights in Brussels, said Cookiebot's findings raised questions about whether the public websites were in violation of the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation.
		"We need an analysis from EU data protection officers of how this behaviour is in line with GDPR," he said. "It's not obvious to me how this is based on any legal grounds ... It shows how pervasive and broken online ad tracking remains, and how urgently we need to fix it."
		Google said: "Our policies are clear: if website publishers choose to use Google web or advertising products, they must obtain consent for cookies associated with those products." Google did not permit publishers to "build targeting lists based on users' sensitive information, including health conditions like pregnancy or HIV".
		Facebook said the investigation "highlights websites that have chosen to use Facebook's Business Tools, for example, the Like and Share buttons, or the Facebook pixel. Our Business Tools help websites and apps grow their communities or better understand how people use their services. Facebook considers it the responsibility of the website owner to inform users of which companies may be tracking them."

<titre>Toulouse rekindle the glory years with stunning win</titre>
<auteur>By Ben Coles</auteur>
<texte>
		Racing 92 21 Toulouse 22 A first-half red card for Zach Holmes was not enough to stop Toulouse from surging into the Champions Cup semi-finals in riveting fashion against Racing 92 at the <meronyme id="2192">La Defense Arena</meronyme> in Paris.
		This was a remarkable display of defensive resilience from Toulouse, down a man for almost an hour, to complement the trio of spectacular tries scored by the French giants in the first half. After years in the wilderness, they are back, and will face Leinster in the final four.  "We are over the moon. We had to tough it out with 14 men and I am so proud of the guys to beat a class outfit in Racing," said Toulouse and Scotland lock Richie Gray.
		Racing's biggest game so far at their astonishing new home certainly lived up to the billing.
		No offence to the injured Yoann Huget, but his withdrawal handed a European debut to the France Under-20 wing Lucas Tauzin, with the young man turning in an astonishing effort that started with an early scampering run down the touchline in a sign of things to come. Toulouse's offloading game has been the toast of France all season and it opened up Racing early on, a switch between Sofiane Guitoune and Maxime Medard freeing up Antoine Dupont for a run to the line. Maxime Machenaud, who missed last year's final against Leinster in Bilbao, put Racing on the board with a penalty, before they took the lead courtesy of another Finn Russell interception, a fortnight after his sprint to the line at Twickenham. There was no score for the Scotland No10 this time, as he grubbered instead along the touchline for the chasing Teddy Thomas, whose try put Racing 10-7 ahead.
		Then came the turning point.
		The excellent referee Luke Pearce, after assessing multiple replays, ruled Holmes had made contact with the neck of Juan Imhoff with his shoulder while making a tackle.
		Did Imhoff dip into the contact? Not enough for Pearce to rule otherwise, leaving Toulouse down to 14 men with only 23 minutes gone. A yellow card for Thomas after a cynical penalty five metres from his line soon levelled up the numbers.
		Toulouse then produced a moment of magic, Romain Ntamack firing out a pass to Tauzin, whose offload to Guitoune belongs in the Louvre museum. Medard finished the attack off, putting Toulouse back in the lead at 12-10.
		How else to describe the end of the first half other than pandemonium. Toulouse, backed up on their own line, somehow produced a turnover, going from try line to try line with Virimi Vakatawa carrying over his own dead-ball line. The mercurial Dupont was on hand, now playing at fly-half and stepping his way through for a second try.
		Toulouse led 19-10 at the break.
		Machenaud chipped away with two penalties as Racing emptied the bench, intent on bullying Toulouse into submission.
		Guitoune's interception sparked a counter-attack that led to Imhoff being yellow carded for coming in from the side, with Thomas Ramos converting the penalty to make it 22-16. But Racing persisted, Camille Chat breaking two tackles to score in the corner. Machenaud could not convert, leaving Racing trailing by a point with the clock almost up.
		The hosts and Leone Nakarawa thought they had snatched victory, only for the Fijian to be penalised for playing a man in the air at the line-out. And so Toulouse advance. What a display of guts and flair.

<titre>Tower is height of fashion after closure of Notre-Dame</titre>
<auteur>By Peter Allen in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		A PARISIAN monument considered to be one of the most dangerous attractions to visit in the French capital is enjoying a new lease of life thanks to the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire.
		Hundreds of British tourists are among those on a waiting list to climb the 300 slippery stone steps of Saint-Jacques, which has now become the city's tallest bell tower with public access.  It affords magnificent views over Paris - but because of the dangers involved, only 17 visitors can go up at a time. Potential dangers include an arduous climb with limited handrails, a gloomy and claustrophobic spiral staircase and a sheer drop of 171ft (52m) from a small zinc roof space.
		"There are great risks involved, and that's why every party has to be accompanied by a security manager," said tour manager Laure Benacin.
		"Despite this, there is huge interest in the tower, with inquiries coming from all over the world, including many from Britain."
		Ms Benacin said the flamboyant Gothic tower was now the perfect alternative to a visit to Notre-Dame, whose 226ft (69m) twin towers are currently under reconstruction. Ariel Weil, the mayor of the city's 4th arrondissement, said he was hugely proud to have both buildings in his district, practically facing each other across the River Seine.
		During a visit to the Saint-Jacques tower with The Telegraph, Mr Weil said: "It is of course not as famous as Notre Dame, but nevertheless a wonderful historic monument." The tower, a stop on the traditional pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, was closed to the public for most of its long history.
		It was part of the Saint-Jacques-dela-Boucherie church that was first mentioned by 12th century chroniclers before being demolished by revolutionaries in 1797. It was finally granted a licence for visitors in 2013 after a renovation project.
		The basilica of Sacré-Coeur at Montmartre, the Pompidou Centre and <mention id="2193">La Défense business district</mention> can all be seen from the top of the landmark, which is open until Nov 4. Children under 10 are not allowed to climb the tower nor vertigo sufferers.

<titre>Sephora plans store openings as it taps 'beauty revolution'  Personal &amp; household goods</titre>
<auteur>HARRIET AGNEW — MADRID</auteur>
<texte>
		France's Sephora is opening up to 150 stores a year as the LVMH-owned beauty and make-up retailer seeks to accelerate its global expansion and keep up with a "beauty revolution", according to its chief executive.
		"Our retail stores are thriving; they're alive, they're kicking," said Sephora chief Chris de Lapuente yesterday in an interview at the FT Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid. "We're opening between 125 and 150 stores every year, and we're constantly renovating our biggest and best stores."  Sephora's investment in physical stores underscores the role it sees for bricks-and-mortar outlets to engage with customers, as part of an "omnichannel" approach that includes ecommerce and building an online community through social media. The regions that will have the most new stores are North America and Asia. Growth in China is forecast to double in the next few years.
		"What matters to us is to build wonderful relationships with our customers and the store is the place where these relationships are created and nurtured," said Mr de Lapuente. "Experiential retail is very much part of Sephora's DNA and we will continue investing in it."
		Sephora has enjoyed strong growth on the back of soaring demand for cosmetics and beauty products.
		LVMH does not break out Sephora's performance, but last year organic sales in the "selective retailing" unit that Sephora is part of rose 12 per cent to €13.65bn, excluding the closure of Hong Kong airport concessions in 2017.
		"It's an extraordinarily dynamic market," said Mr de Lapuente, a former longtime Procter &amp; Gamble executive who became Sephora's chief in 2011. "We're living in a beauty revolution."
		On Friday a Sephora store will open on Times Square in New York, its largest in the US. Last week Sephora reopened its second-largest store in France, in <mention id="2194">the Paris business district of La Défense</mention>, after a major renovation. It is due to reopen its largest store in the world, at the Dubai Mall, tomorrow following an extensive overhaul.
		Sephora stocks about 300 brands, including its own private label, in 34 countries. It has 2,500 stores worldwide and employs 40,000 people.
		Mr de Lapuente said that for Sephora "experiential" retail meant that "when customers come into the stores they have a wonderful experience".

<titre>If Sarries did nothing wrong, then Prince Andrew is a virgin  McCall must find a way to get minds focused on the pitch after unsure performance in Paris</titre>
<auteur>BRIAN MOORE</auteur>
<texte>
		So, Saracens are not to continue their appeal against the £5.4million fine and 35-point deduction for not declaring income and breaking the salary cap for three seasons. This is not surprising for anyone who knows much about the procedural niceties of the case and given the sanction was handed down by a very experienced and highly qualified independent tribunal. It does seem to have come as a bit of a shock to some, who are trying to claim that this move says nothing about the merits of Saracens' case. Evidently, it is purely on playing grounds and does not dent the claim that Saracens did nothing wrong, bar a bit of administrative misunderstanding.  Sure; and if you believe that you probably think Prince Andrew is a virgin.
		Anyhow, what people wanted to see this weekend was whether all this had any effect on the playing field; which is where this well-run club do not usually make elementary errors that lead to punishment. As far as the players are concerned, I do not believe it is their responsibility to police the club's administrative obligations. In any event, how would they know whether the cap was being broken, without access to every payment made to every player? For head coach Mark McCall this cannot have been an easy period and it cannot have had no effect on the wider squad. It is easy to say that adversity can be used as a tool to tighten bonds between everyone on the playing side, but it does not always turn out that way. Harlequins found the rift between the club's interests and those of Tom Williams, who was a popular member of the squad, could not be squared properly in the relentless publicity battle after "Bloodgate".
		While you cannot say that an off-field furore affects players on the field, Saracens' first-half performance against Racing 92 was atypical for the north London club. More unforced errors were made by Saracens than you would expect in several games and this meant they stuttered and failed to get any real foothold in the match. The side chosen was arguably the best available in the circumstances but the lack of familiarity was apparent to anyone watching.
		This was never going to be an easy game, given the quality of the hosts and the unique atmosphere of the Paris <meronyme id="2195">la Defense Arena</meronyme>.
		Saracens were given a way back into the game by some terrible handling from Racing which gifted Alex Lozowski a try, but the immediate riposte from Finn Russell demonstrated how far off the mark Saracens were. If there is any spill-over from matters outside the white lines, McCall has to remove it quickly because Saracens will get a "friendly and warm" reception from every set of away fans this season.
		There is nothing the players can do about this and they are not to blame, but they have to make sure that a difficult situation does not get any worse.
		As for the English performance of the weekend, look no further than the only Premiership club making money - Exeter. A bonuspoint win away to La Rochelle is a huge statement of intent, even if the French side are not playing as well as when they burst on to the European scene a few seasons ago.
		A typically controlled performance from the West Country side was simply too disciplined for La Rochelle, who could not get their big ball carriers into the game to take the initiative and play on the front foot. When Exeter get into their familiar groove of multiple-phase rugby, they are difficult to resist. The challenge this year is to make the break into rugby which can register points without needing attrition before it pays off. That bit of magic is all Exeter are lacking to become a properly complete team.
		Elsewhere, Northampton beat Lyon, who head the Top 14. The progress made since the departure of Jim Mallinder and Dorian West has been remarkable, but you get the feeling that coach Chris Boyd will be irked that his side did not gain a bonus point after racing into a 19-point lead at halftime.
		If there is one thing that will hold them back it is the relative weakness of their scrum.
		As England found out against South Africa, you cannot win games in which you are constantly giving ground and penalties away because you are being beaten in this set-piece.

<titre>Russell piles on misery for weakened champions</titre>
<auteur>By Kate Rowan at Paris La Defense Arena</auteur>
<texte>
		Racing 92 30 Saracens 10 Att: 20,275 It was surreal to see and hear the Saracens players dejectedly troop off the field as hosts Racing ran away as four-try bonus-point winners.
		AC/DC's Highway to Hell was blaring through the roofed stadium, while an elaborate light show, including a circle of stars bearing a strikingly similar appearance to the European Union flag, was projected on to the pitch. Perhaps, the joke was centred around Brexit, but based on the defending champions' lacklustre performance, it looks as though Mark McCall's men will endure a hellish journey in the Heineken Champions Cup after their first loss in the competition since the 2018 quarterfinal against Leinster.  If they decide not to appeal against their Premiership points deduction, they will field a less than full strength side in Europe to focus their wealth of England international riches on domestic top-flight survival. And if this was the beginning of a new era for Saracens in Europe, the signs are ominous.
		The only players from England's run to the World Cup final to start were hooker Jack Singleton, newly arrived from Worcester Warriors, and scrum-half Ben Spencer, who was flown to Japan in the build-up to the final. Without the experience of captain and fly-half Owen Farrell, Jamie George, Maro Itoje, Mako and Billy Vunipola, Saracens looked callow and at times naive, particularly around the line-out.
		McCall, the director of rugby, said: "They came at us in waves in the first 20 minutes and we weren't able to control the speed of their ball. We were up against it the whole game; it was impossible to get anything to hang our hat on."
		It was little surprise that Racing, despite sitting 10th in the Top 14, dominated from the start. The Parisians' nine-10 axis of France's Maxime Machenaud and Scotland's Finn Russell controlled the game and their experience smothered Manu Vunipola's attempts to get a foothold. Hooker Camille Chat and flanker Wenceslas Lauret, who stood out in France's World Cup campaign, were key in undermining Saracens' set-piece efforts. Virimi Vakatawa, another strong contributor to France's run to the quarter-finals, scored the opening try after he easily cut through the Saracens midfield after 10 minutes.
		By the 27th minute, when wing Teddy Thomas ran in at the corner, the Londoners were on the ropes. The players looked nervy and disassociated at times, but could be excused considering the off-field drama. But Jackson Wray, captaining the side on his 50th European performance for the club, said his side were not in any way splintered.
		"I haven't seen an inch of divide.
		Not one," the back row insisted.
		"Obviously, there were emotional roller coasters going on last week, but in terms of player-to-player, player-to-coach, not one divide. We've always been in everything together, through good times and bad times. This is an opportunity for us to come together even more.
		"You don't grow an environment that we have overnight. It's taken 10 years, it has taken wins, losses and it has taken everything you've seen. The common theme is the core players have been there throughout that. The likelihood is that other teams may fracture, but our vision as a club hasn't changed."
		This spirit of togetherness came to light early in the second half and, just after 50 minutes, Saracens reduced the gap to eight points as Alex Lozowski crossed off the back of some savvy work from centre partner Nick Tompkins, who had snatched the ball from Racing. Full-back Matt Gallagher also impressed on the counter-attack.
		Yet that was to be as good as it got as, shortly afterwards, Racing had their third try following an immaculately timed dummy from Russell. The bonus point was secured just after the hour mark as Lauret scurried over after yet another Racing line-out win.
		To compound Saracens' difficult evening, replacement scrum-half Tom Whiteley was sent to the sin-bin for the final six minutes.

<titre>Power brokers must realise that game on the field is in rude health</titre>
<auteur>MICK CLEARY TALKING RUGBY</auteur>
<texte>
		Here is a piece of advice to rugby's power brokers - be careful what you meddle with. If there is a fan of the sport out there who has not been beguiled by the action on the field over the past fortnight, then he or she must have been hiding in a darkened room with no mobile phone or broadband signal. It has been a case of sensory overload.
		The climax of the Guinness Six Nations lived up to its "Super Saturday" billing. If that high mark of the international game was not enough for you, then this past weekend's European quarter-finals redrafted the criteria for what constitutes sporting excellence. The last-eight stage of the Champions Cup is invariably the best weekend of club action in the calendar. So it proved, with Sunday's gripper between Racing 92 and Toulouse in Paris the stuff of a marketing man's dream.  So far, so good. There are dark linings, however, to those silver clouds. By the end of this week, World Rugby wants to know if its supposedly sport-saving plans for a global Nations Championship will get the go-ahead from the leading countries, particularly in Europe.
		The proposal is the brainchild of Agustin Pichot, the World Rugby vice-chairman and former Argentina scrum-half, who has long been an advocate of a pathway for tier-two teams into the elite.
		Pichot also expressed in apocalyptic terms six months ago the consequences of sitting back and relying on the status quo to provide for the game around the world. "I do not want to be an architect to rugby's ruin," Pichot said.
		Yet, if the events of the past fortnight have shown anything, it is that the game itself has a vibrant output. The Six Nations has long had full-house notices posted but the club game, too, has its audience, with substantial crowds at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Murrayfield and <meronyme id="2198">La Defense Arena</meronyme>. Only Saracens, market leaders in so much of what they have done, have not managed to transfer the bumper crowds they draw to Wembley or, more recently, the London Stadium, to support their cause at Allianz Park, which hosted 10,997 against Glasgow Warriors.
		The Champions Cup had so much to offer, be it the no-quartergiven all-Irish affair in Dublin, a nerve-shredding event shaded by Leinster, or the bewitching efforts of 14-man Toulouse, who came through against Racing despite having fly-half Zack Holmes sent off in the 23rd minute for a dangerous tackle on Juan Imhoff. One offload from Lucas Tauzin, Toulouse's 20-year-old wing, that led to a try for Maxime Medard was worth a season's admission price, let alone a single match.
		Why, then, are Pichot and his World Rugby colleagues so concerned? Money, as ever, is at the root of their unease. In essence, the game in the southern hemisphere is in trouble financially. There are fears that the brawn drain to clubs in the north will only get more pronounced as the pound and the euro punch their weight. The Nations Championship, with an annual face-off between 12 countries (six in the south, six in the north), culminating in a final of the top two in the table, has been bundled together in a package worth £5billion for a 12-year deal.
		Promotion and relegation in each hemisphere is a core element, an imperative that is set to derail any progress as far as the Six Nations clan is concerned. The Rugby Football Union, in particular, has taken heat for its stance, based primarily on its concerns that even the outside chance of putative relegation is a risk too far, with one source telling The Daily Telegraph that if that were ever to happen, "Twickenham would have to be sold".
		Those who argue that outlandish possibilities never come to pass were obviously not in David Cameron's shoes when he was considering calling a referendum. Moreover, if the meritocratic principles of promotion and relegation did not eventually generate a European league where Georgia might one day beat England, then what is its point? Pichot is to be applauded for his passion. Even if this scheme does not get off the ground, it should not be seen as a loss of face for those involved. What it has done is concentrate minds north and south of the equator. There does need to be greater consensus on the redistribution of wealth. And the tier-two (excuse the dreadful, patronising phrase) countries do need investment and opportunity. Why not guarantee at least one fixture per calendar year against tier one? That would be a start.
		Above all, though, for all the financial anxieties, let us not lose sight of the fact that the sport on the field is in rude health, with the women's game also in fine fettle.

		Jack is back for Wasps Dai Young was left fuming at the end of Wasps' controversial defeat against Leicester and had to deal with an early injury to his son Thomas. However, the performance of replacement Jack Willis will have offered a silver lining.
		The 22 year-old back-rower is fit again following a nine-month injury lay-off after he suffered serious knee damage during last season's semi-final defeat by Saracens. That put him out of contention for England's tour to South Africa, but Willis seems intent on nudging Eddie Jones ahead of the World Cup.  He proved a breakdown pest at Welford Road on Saturday, swooping over carrier Tom Youngs (above) and surviving a clear-out attempt from three tight-five forwards to win a trademark turnover. Willis emerged from the pile-up and told referee JP Doyle: "I've got the ball". The penalty was awarded to Wasps.
		Racing 92 stars poised for Six Nations? If Scotland supporters - and Gregor Townsend - watched Finn Russell's return for Racing 92 from behind the sofa in fear of an injury, they would have missed some fireworks.
		Russell fizzed passes throughout a 50-14 win over La Rochelle at <meronyme id="2199">the futuristic Paris La Defense Arena</meronyme> and sliced over for a first-half try. However, wing Teddy Thomas headlined the afternoon with a hat-trick that will surely put him back in the France shake-up.
		This flick from Virimi Vakatawa (above), who has not represented Les Bleus since last February, helped create the second try of Thomas's treble. Without turning his body, Vakatawa transfers Henry Chavancy's pass to Thomas, who glides beyond Ihaia West and jinks past La Rochelle full-back Kini Murimurivalu.

<titre>Our towns and cities are all the better for Prince Charles</titre>
<auteur>ROSS CLARK</auteur>
<texte>
		Of course it sounds outrageous, Lord Rogers's claim that Prince Charles is interfering in the planning system in London. We are supposed to have a democratic process, not an unofficial vetting procedure run by the heir to the throne who, according to Lord Rogers, but denied by Clarence House, regularly receives plans from developers which he either approves or rejects.
		Yet there is one thing which stops me getting annoyed with the Prince - evidence that throughout history, royal patronage has given us rather more impressive townscapes than have trained architects and town planners.  Would London be a better city without the role played by Prince Charles's 17th century ancestor and namesake after the Great Fire of 1666? It was Charles II who picked out the blueprint for a new London, drawn up by an astronomer and amateur architect by the name of Christopher Wren.
		Lord Rogers has previously tried to claim Christopher Wren for his side of the argument, suggesting that, had Prince Charles been in the shoes of Charles II he would have insisted that St Paul's be rebuilt in Tudor style. But that misses the point. Wren was an outsider whose work would have been dismissed had a body of trained and experienced architects been put in charge of the reconstruction.
		Would Paris be a better city had it not been for the input of Napoleon III, who appointed a civil servant by the name of Baron Haussmann to oversee its redevelopment? You can argue that the new Paris was pompous and grandiose, but you can't deny that the boulevards continue to be appreciated by rather more people than flock to <mention id="2200">La Defense</mention>, <mention id="2201">the awful bit of Paris built between the 1960s and 1980s when the architects were in charge</mention>.
		As for Prince Charles's own contribution to modern Britain, the Dorchester suburb of Poundbury, it is easy to sniff at its faux Georgian buildings. Yet Poundbury sparked a revival of classicism in the design of housing estates which, if not always successful, are a lot more popular with homebuyers than the miserable 1960s and 1970s estates which preceded them.
		Lord Rogers calls the Prince of Wales "architecturally ignorant". He may well be - but then, he's not exactly getting out his drawing board and sketching developments himself, just passing judgment on what is put before him. If Lord Rogers thinks non-architects have no right to an opinion on architecture he may care to reflect on how architects seem to have little inhibition in wading into areas which are beyond their own competence - such as trying to solve social issues through their buildings.
		I am not sure that Prince Charles is the best arbiter of what makes a good building, but I am thankful that there is someone keeping the architectural profession in its place.

<titre>Paris to build seven skyscrapers to lure financial business from London</titre>
<auteur>By Michael Stothard in Paris</auteur>
<texte>
		Paris will build seven skyscrapers in <mention id="2202">its business district</mention> as part of an aggressive campaign to lure financial services companies from London after the UK leaves the E U.
		As much as 375,000 sq m of office space, the size of about 50 football pitches, will be built by 2021 as part of the city's wider efforts to "accommodate the new talent" coming to the city. Marie-Célie Guillaume, chief of Defacto La Défense, the body responsible for managing <mention id="2203">the financial hub in western Paris</mention>, said yesterday that it wanted to send a "powerful message to businesses that are uncertain about their future in London".  Paris is vying with Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin to attract banks, insurers, start-ups and other companies worried about what will happen when Britain leaves the political bloc. Paris has been one of the most aggressive in its efforts.
		Immediately after the referendum on June 23, President François Hollande's Socialist government changed the tax rules for expatriates in Paris to make it more generous, and put together a high-level team to lobby global companies.
		On a visit to London on Tuesday, Emmanuel Macron, the independent French presidential candidate, said that he wanted British "banks, talents, researchers, academics" to move to France after Brexit.
		Bankers in the UK and France have expressed scepticism that Paris could become Europe's financial hub, citing the inflexibility of French labour laws, the language barrier and high taxes.
		They say, however, that some operations in London that rely on EU "passporting" rights to operate across the bloc could move to the continent.
		In January, HSBC became the first big bank to detail plans to move jobs out of London after the Brexit vote, confirming plans to move 1,000 roles in its investment bank to Paris.
		UBS said that about the same number of its London employees could be affected by Brexit, while Jamie Dimon , chief of JPMorgan Chase, said that more than 4,000 of his bank's 16,000 UK staff could be displaced.

<titre>JP Morgan warns French over tough labour laws</titre>
<auteur>By Ben Martin BANKING CORRESPONDENT</auteur>
<texte>
		THE boss of Wall Street giant JP Morgan has warned the French president that the country is unlikely to lure banking jobs away from London after Brexit unless the nation overhauls employment legislation.
		Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan's respected chief executive, is said to have told Francois Hollande in October that France must loosen its labour laws, which currently make it difficult for banks to recruit and shed staff, if Paris is to rival London as a financial hub.  Mr Dimon is believed to have been seeking a change of legislation specifically regarding the employment of high-paid staff at financial firms. Mr Hollande, who in December announced he would not seek a second term, reassured the US bank boss that a revamp would be instigated by the next president, reported the Wall Street Journal. The comments were made in a meeting between Mr Hollande, Mr Dimon and a host of advisers to JP Morgan. They are significant as competition is now hotting up to attract financial services jobs away from the City in the wake of the June vote for the UK to leave the European Union.
		Banks, insurers and asset managers that have their European operations based in Britain are fearful that they will lose their access to the EU's single market once the UK secedes from the 28-nation bloc.
		The Government, which has committed to starting the two-year EU exit process by the end of March, is yet to give the City any clarity on the terms of the Brexit deal it wants with Brussels.
		As a result, firms are already drawing up contingency plans in case single market access is lost and industry insiders believe banks could start the laborious process of moving jobs in the next few months. It would deal a blow to London's status as a global powerhouse and hub for European finance. JP Morgan declined to comment.

<titre>Real fans the winners as game bares soul for a day  Twickenham showdown tomorrow reclaims HQ for club supporters from the corporate brigade</titre>
<auteur>AUSTIN HEALEY</auteur>
<texte>
		Going to Twickenham for supporters is a very special experience, but unless you work for a big corporate or you are the guest of someone wealthy, it is quite difficult to go and watch England play there now. A standard day out for a family of four, particularly if you are travelling from outside London, will leave you without much change from £1,000.
		Which is why the Big Game tomorrow, this year featuring Harlequins against Wasps, still feels so important. It is a more affordable day out at the spiritual home of rugby, at a time of year when people love either to get away from their family, or take them along for a day out.  Before I signed for Leicester, they would always play the Barbarians on Boxing Day. You had to buy a ticket for the game about a year beforehand, because it sold out so quickly.
		The very first time I went to Twickenham, you could still stand up in the West Stand. You do not get those places as often in rugby any more, but Twickenham still has that special feeling. You can go there and feel inspired to take up the sport.
		TELEGRAPH THE FOR I remember playing there when it was three-sided, before they built the South Stand hotel, and it was just amazing, I am not sure why. It was similar to <meronyme id="2204">the La Defense stadium</meronyme> used now by Racing 92 in Paris, with the enormous screen occupying one end of the stadium.
		 That could WILLIAMS JAY really be the blueprint for any new ground, particularly now teams are happy to play on fake pitches. The lack of a need for real grass can also make new stadiums become amazing concert venues.
		With the enormous bowl that Twickenham is now, you just feel the weight of the stadium. When the changing-room doors are shut, you could have U2 playing out on the pitch and you would not hear them. You walk out and it is a cacophony of noise, walking past those shoots of flame going up around the pitch. The stadium in many ways is more important than whoever is playing on the pitch. It is a special occasion.
		Twickenham is the soul of rugby, particularly for the English. To deny access to the soul of rugby based on price is not great, but if there are other events such as the Big Game where people can go and enjoy Twickenham, then tickets should be snapped up.
		Rugby clubs are often scared that if they move a game to a bigger stadium they will not sell out.
		Clubs have to work particularly hard to sell enough tickets to reach their break-even target. For a team such as Harlequins, who get around 12,000 regularly, that means trying to sell three times their gate.
		So it is a big risk. But if you book it, people will come - as long as you make it affordable.
		St James' Park last season was great for Newcastle's game with Northampton, and I have been lucky enough to play at Anfield and Old Trafford - when was the last time we had a match of rugby union on there? If Sale could have a game at Old Trafford and put 40,000 people in there that would be amazing, and who is to say they can't? The Big Game might make a lot of money for the clubs, but not at the expense of the supporters.
		 The Test matches at Twickenham make money at the expense of the soul of the sport, of their fans. You just get a lot of corporate people going for a nice meal.
		As for the game itself, Wasps are in a bit of a strange place in terms of their ability to win matches. They have brought in Lima Sopoaga, who is a very good player, but he does not quite fit the way they want to play. They are probably the best example of a side not earning the right to go wide before they try to.
		Meanwhile, there is more in the tank for Harlequins. If they can win against Wasps, then they can begin to start mapping out a route to the top four, given the favourable run of games they have coming up.
		They are a decent outside bet to make the play-offs, but a lot will depend on how much their regular England players, including Danny Care and Mike Brown, will be involved in the Six Nations.

		Jan du Plessis
		 Heave ho
		 Theresa May might be losing the confidence of parliament but the PM can still convene a roomful of business leaders. With only a few days' notice, more than 100 of them showed up on Monday night to toast the Brexit deal she'd sealed with Brussels the day before. After a scene-setter from new Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, a rapidfire presentation from Number 10 chief of staff Gavin Barwell and a few words from the PM herself, there was a bit of Q&amp;A. Many of the great and good were in attendance, including the City's key representatives on the PM's new business council for services — Paul Manduca, chairman of the Pru, and Shriti Vadera, who chairs Santander UK. Also there were high-octane figures from Aston Martin boss Andy Palmer to Goldman Sachs International chief Richard Gnodde. Most kept a low profile. But Jan du Plessis, pictured, the new BT chairman, took the prize for sycophant of the month, praising Mrs May's "tenacity and determination" and promising to urge fellow business leaders to "get behind the PM" and her deal. "You might have seen a couple of people with their fingers down their throat," one attendee told City Insider. A queasy double meaning to reports that the room was heaving.
		Arnaud de Bresson
		 Allez-retour
		 The boss of Paris Europlace, Arnaud de Bresson, was over in London on Wednesday for the FT's Brexit and Beyond conference. The man whose job it is to woo business from the City to Paris did his bit to promote the merits of the French financial centre. But more impressive was the speed and efficiency of his commute. He spent the morning in Paris, attending the UN's launch of its responsible banking principles, before hotfooting it by Eurostar to his early afternoon session at the FT conference near Tower Bridge. Then back to Paris to see Paul McCartney's gig in <mention id="2205">La Défense</mention>. For all his keenness to see France profit from Brexit, he's hoping the frictionless travel is unharmed. Live and let die, as Macca might say.
		Jon Cunliffe
		 Down at heel
		 Never mind the 10.5 per cent slump in the economy that the Bank of England predicted on Wednesday would ensue in the event of a nodeal Brexit. Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, had urgent business to attend to.
		Finding perhaps that his shoes were not prepared for the biblical flood that Brexit will unleash (or at least leaked in Wednesday's drizzle), he repaired to Loake's, round the corner from the Old Lady of Threadneedle St. Minus his security pass unfortunately. City Insider encountered Sir Jon queueing with the plebs — and being subjected to the same search and security checks — before he was allowed back into the Old Lady's hallowed halls for the press conference that delivered that torrent of Brexit bad news.
		Reform Club
		 No grousing
		 To the Reform Club on Pall Mall for a good old-fashioned lunch with one of City Insider's oldest chums. The day was autumnal. The fires were roaring in the grates. But imagine the disappointment when said chum ordered the grouse, only to be told there was none. The combination of spring storms and summer wildfires killed off the grouse season almost before it had begun. Result: very few birds. And a 50 per cent jump in prices. "It's just too expensive," said the apologetic maître d'. "We've taken it off the menu." Happily, the pheasant did a valiant job of filling in.

<titre>City chiefs brace for a 'global battle for skills'  Employment Urban leaders must prepare for a new working landscape, says Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson</titre>
<auteur>Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson</auteur>
<texte>
		W ork has always shaped our cities; the world's great population hubs have provided pools of talent, suppliers and customers for business, and the towers of commerce still define skylines from Manhattan to Malaysia. But when work changes, how must our cities? "Fundamentally the cost of distance — the cost of moving goods and people — sits at the foundation of so much of what we do. Cities were invented to solve that problem," says Karen Harris, managing director of consultancy Bain &amp; Company's macro trends group. Yet as she and her colleague Andrew Schwedel wrote in a 2016 report, technologies from robotics and 3D printing to autonomous vehicles are eroding the cost of moving people, goods and information, accelerating change in the "monuments to spatial economics" we know as cities.  Ms Harris argues that urban centres from Paris to San Francisco will always appeal to a group of "rich people and single people and empty nesters" who can afford them. Yet the fact that the middleclass bedrock of a city's workforce now has other options raises the question of whether cities can retain their competitive advantage as hubs for work.
		Forecasts suggest the world's big cities will not, in fact, lack labour. In the latest update to its World Urbanisation Prospects report, the UN predicted that the percentage of the global population living in urban areas — which rose from 30 per cent in 1950 to 55 per cent now — will hit 69 per cent by 2050.
		"What's happened in every revolution is a massive structural change in employment, but we don't have less employment," says Mike Sutcliff, group chief executive of Accenture Digital, a consultancy.
		Yet even the UN's headline prediction hints at the challenges cities face, from infrastructure and social services for growing populations of future workers to integrating immigrants with minimal social friction. Dig deeper and the scale of upheaval becomes more apparent.
		The biggest changes in the urban vs rural divide will not be in the economies that are most familiar to the largest employers, such as Japan and Germany, but in fast-developing countries like India, China and Nigeria that these organisations are learning to navigate.
		As they contemplate this prospect, business and civic leaders know that their existing workers, from cashiers to consultants, face their own disruptions. The advance of automation and artificial intelligence means as many as a third of all workers in the US may need to change occupations and acquire new skills by 2030, according to a new report for the US Council on Foreign Relations.
		If that is not to leave millions behind, increasing inequality, local governments will need explicit policies for training their workers, "creating better jobs and career paths for Americans", the report's authors concluded.
		If most of the jobs of the future will require more than a secondary school education, this is a challenge that city leaders can start working on now, according to Josh Lowe, who writes on the future of work for Apolitical, an online platform for sharing insights among policymakers and public servants around the world.
		"There are some things I think we know city leaders can be doing or areas they can be looking at to start preparing their populations," says Mr Lowe. "The first would be around skills and training, particularly around adult skills in the middle of their careers."
		Mr Lowe notes that cities are not only competing to attract big employers such as Amazon and Apple, with the prestige and tax revenues their big tech campuses offer. He says there is also a trend towards trying to lure businesses that can provide "middle-skill jobs" from healthcare to plumbing.
		The Dallas Federal Reserve has been among those to recommend better "middle skills" training in cities to close the skills gap, and Muriel Pénicaud, Emmanuel Macron's labour minister, is overhauling France's €32bn-a-year vocational training scheme to give every worker €5,000 to spend on courses of their choice over their careers.
		From Munich to Boston, Apolitical has also tracked city-backed retraining programmes targeted at women and minorities, groups which many studies predict will be hardest hit by automation.
		While Mr Sutcliff has seen Accenture's large corporate clients make similar investments in training, the growth of the gig economy may require that cities — rather than employers — help workforces navigate this transition.
		As Ms Pénicaud put it, "a global battle for skills has been launched". The opportunity for the cities that win that battle will be to reinvent themselves in a way that tempts even the mobile middle classes to stay.
		"The very technologies we talk about that are potentially eliminating jobs in some sectors ... create opportunities for many businesses," says Ms Harris at Bain. As craft breweries pop up in former manufacturing hubs, "there is something lovely about that cultural renewal", she adds.

<titre>Paris's passion for Japanese architecture  A wave of new buildings is testament to the city's admiration for architects such as Shigeru Ban and Kengo Kuma. By Edwin Heathcote</titre>
<auteur>By Edwin Heathcote</auteur>
<texte>
		R oland Barthes, while wandering the streets of Tokyo in 1966, noticed the Japanese culture of gift boxes. "Geometric, rigorously drawn," he wrote, "and yet always signed somewhere with an asymmetrical fold or knot, by the care, the very technique of its making, the interplay of cardboard, wood, paper, ribbon, it is no longer the temporary accessory of the object to be transported, but itself becomes an object; the envelope, in itself, is consecrated as a precious though gratuitous thing; the package is a thought."
		In Empire of Signs Barthes compared the tradition of Japanese packaging to architecture, in which what is important is the wrapping, often delicate but at the heart of which is empty space. He implicitly compared this to Tokyo itself, a complex, super-dense city with a void at its centre, the inaccessible imperial palace, the house of a man who is never seen.  As an intellectual culture often more engaged with the sign than the signified, modern France has fetishised the minimal aesthetic culture of Japan, perhaps as an antidote to the rich, gilded rococo of its own built fabric. From the Impressionists through to Jacques Roubaud, Chris Marker, Michel Foucault and even Jacques Chirac, Paris has been gently marinated in Japanophilia. There had been successful Japanese national pavilions but the first permanent (and very visible) signs of this fascination on the skyline came during a wave of construction in <mention id="2206">the La Défense business district</mention> in the late 1980s, notably Kisho Kurokawa's Pacific Tower with its Zen-ish rooftop garden (1992) and Kenzo Tange's curious Grand Ecran complex (1991). Then, in 1995, came Tadao Ando's striking meditation cylinder at the Unesco building, with its hovering disc of a ceiling.
		And now Ando is back with another concrete cylinder. The conversion of the city's central Bourse de Commerce into a public gallery for the luxury goods magnate François Pinault is the latest surge in a sudden flood of Japanese architecture in the French capital.
		Last year Shigeru Ban completed La Seine Musicale concert hall on the Île Seguin. With its death-star dome and dramatic concrete interiors, this is very much a building in the city's tradition of grands projets. Ban's previous Parisian building, the delicate, translucent extension to the Musée du Luxembourg (completed 2011), was very different, featuring his characteristic use of cardboard tubes as a construction material. Meanwhile Kengo Kuma, having built the Pôle multi-équipements Macdonald, an impressive mixed-use college and sports centre, in 2011 is now at work on the huge Aurore scheme. A combined "eco-luxury hotel", performance space, offices, hostel and co-working space above the railway tracks at the Gare d'Austerlitz, it is scheduled for completion in 2022. In the renderings, it looks like a kind of bamboo-framed jungle, its hanging gardens and timber terraces having more of Bali in them than Rive Gauche. But it will certainly make an impact, as will Kuma's other major project in the city, an elegant-looking transparent and terraced building for the Grand Paris Express, the Gare Saint-Denis Pleyel (due 2023).
		Amid all this activity, the building that is making the most waves is Sou Fujimoto's Milles Arbres, a floppy pancake that straddles the Périphérique in the Pershing district. It will be, as its name suggests, crowned by a thousand trees, but it will also include a village of translucent houses amid the greenery. Fujimoto is also designing the delicate glazed and faceted École Polytechnique at the Université Paris-Saclay campus.
		And then, after all that, there's SANAA. The practice formed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa was arguably responsible for sparking this new explosion of Japanese architecture with their ethereal Louvre in Lens (2012), which has turned out to be one of the most memorable museums of the modern age. From its inception as a published design, its almost disappearing architecture generated a particular excitement in France, a renewed passion for the minimal Japanese aesthetic.
		It has proved difficult, however, to translate that architecture into Paris's fiercely protected streetscapes, and SANAA has been working on the rebuilding of the city's La Samaritaine department store for what seems an eternity. Originally scheduled to open in 2013, the design has faced opposition at every stage, with conservationists seemingly determined to put a stop to the arrival of contemporary architecture in the very centre of the city.
		Yet the design is hardly the kind of aggressive intervention that might be expected to raise hackles. What looks like a delicate net curtain is drawn around the structure, and its curving folds subtly echo the rhythm of the neighbouring building's structural grid. From the renderings at least, it appears to be a lovely thing.
		But perhaps the problems encountered in the construction of this building highlight precisely the differences between SANAA's home city of Tokyo and Paris — differences that help explain the yearning of the latter for the former. For Tokyo is everything Paris is not. Its architecture is unruly and unregulated, it is high-tech and highly illuminated, a sci-fi city of filmic intensity and churning change. It is a city of fleeting images rather than permanent physical fabric.
		Paris, on the other hand, has long been stuck in its own perfection, bound by strict codes that govern appearance, dimensions and materials. Its architects dream of Tokyo's easy- going attitude to the existing physical fabric. They yearn for an architecture of disappearance rather than solidity. Just as Barthes was seduced by a city of mysterious codes, contemporary Parisians have been attracted to a culture of ethereality.
		You might think that, in an era of globalised architecture, there is nothing unusual about a European capital boasting so many buildings by Japanese architects. But then you might look over the Channel to another capital, one that has always proclaimed itself to be more open to international influence and more welcoming of change — London — and find not a single work by a Japanese architect. In fact the only work I can think of that would qualify in the whole of the UK is a wall built by Tadao Ando in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens which is about to be demolished.
		It's possible that the waters of this architectural deluge might be receding. Not all recent designs have been universally welcomed — as witness SANAA's Samaritaine difficulties — while Shigeru Ban's Metz outpost of the Pompidou (which last year hosted an exhibition of Japanese architecture) is a far less elegant building than the Louvre's in Lens.
		Fujimoto's Mille Arbres design is also drawing criticism for its lack of public space. So just as we are about to enter the phase when so many of the results of this architectural amour will be opening, perhaps the affair with Japanese architecture is fading.
		As Roland Barthes wrote: "By its very perfection, this envelope, often repeated (you can be unwrapping a package forever), postpones the discovery of the object it contains — one which is often insignificant, for it is precisely a specialty of the Japanese package that the triviality of the thing be disproportionate to the luxury of the envelope."
		The building that is making the most waves is Milles Arbres, a floppy pancake in the Pershing district.

<titre>SocGen investment bank aims to reinvent itself  New chief on a mission to convince shareholders and clients of the merits of broadening out from equities derivatives</titre>
<auteur>DAVID KEOHANE AND LAURA NOONAN PARIS</auteur>
<texte>
		It has been 20 years since Société Générale gave up the quaint trappings of historic Paris for the gleaming practicality of <meronyme id="2207">its towers</meronyme> in <mention id="2208">La Défense</mention>, <mention id="2209">the French capital's modern business district</mention>.
		Now, Séverin Cabannes, SocGen's new investment bank chief, is on a mission to convince shareholders of the merits of another pragmatic break with the past — reinventing his division around a broader base than the market-leading equities derivatives franchise that critics say is fading fast.  The investment bank has been under fierce scrutiny following the March departure of Mr Cabannes' predecessor Didier Valet and a "watershed" first quarter where SocGen's equities revenues rose just 6 per cent while those of rival BNP Paribas were up 38 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs data.
		Rival bankers and former SocGen staff say its woes started much earlier, beginning with the departure almost 10 years ago of the star traders who created the bank's market-leading equity derivatives business, including Jean-Pierre Mustier, now CEO of the Italian lender UniCredit.
		"They lost some real leaders in the field who were instrumental in getting SocGen where they got to," said one equities professional who used to work at SocGen and now works for a rival bank. "It's a real, real shame for the amazing franchise that they had."
		SocGen is now Emea's [Europe, Middle East and Africa] third biggest equities operator by revenue, having lost its number one ranking in 2013, according to data from industry monitor Coalition. Its shares have fallen 23 per cent since March 1; shares in the benchmark Stoxx EU 50 banks have fallen almost 17 per cent over the same period, while shares in France's CAC40 have risen almost 1.5 per cent.
		In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Cabannes said he did not think equity derivatives differentiated SocGen any more, but that the bank must explain itself better.
		"I think we have still to do more pedagogic work," said Mr Cabannes, 60, who has been at SocGen since 1997. "In the first quarter we made a dedicated deep dive on our global market activities for our investors and analysts. It was very well received and I think we have to continue in that direction."
		The deep dive emphasised the extent of the fixed income business, which Soc-Gen deliberately began growing after the financial crisis because the bank believed it attracted a risk premium for being overly exposed to equities.
		Mr Cabannes stands by SocGen's attempt at reinvention by investing in fixed income at a time when almost every other bank was cutting it back, as well as SocGen's decision to limit risk exposure in the "unstable" markets of the first quarter, when volatility lurched from record lows to extreme highs and the lender "had a low risk appetite".
		SocGen — which will soon buy Commerzbank's structured financial and investment products business, EMC, according to people familiar with the matter — is trying to increase its penetration with corporate clients, who make up just 35 per cent of its existing base.
		Mr Cabannes also hinted that the bank could adjust its product focus to better fit the kind of market conditions that he blamed for its poor first quarter performance. "What we see today is you have more demand in flow products than in structured products," he said. "So, that is a question but it's not what we have really decided yet. Perhaps we can reweight a bit our flow activities compared to our structured product activities."
		But he was cautious on whether such an adjustment would yield meaningful results. He saw the conditions of the first quarter as transitory and as such had no plans for big shifts. "The problem we have is that the perception of investors takes time to be convinced," he said. "For me it's a very clear strategy we have continuously delivered and this strategy is still the same."
		Among analysts, scepticism remains high. "The first quarter was a watershed ... Banks printed money in equity derivatives, SocGen was weak relative to US peers and BNP," said one. "Fifteen years ago, I used to call it the Goldman Sachs of French banking: they had a bad quarter once every year, but their other three quarters more than made up for it." Now, "there's an opportunity for competitors to attack the franchise".
		Citi analyst Azzurra Guelfi said first quarter equities revenues were "a disappointment" and "management did not fully address market concerns in the call in explaining the reason for this weakness compared to peers".
		The investment bank's attempts at reinvention find a kinder audience internally at SocGen, which is in the early stages of a three-year plan to boost returns by cutting costs and accelerating a push into digital banking.
		"We are no longer what we were 10 years ago, a pure equity derivatives house," said Philippe Heim, the bank's deputy CEO and international retail boss. "We were the nerds in that space and we developed the business ... We had a great generation of guys inventing all the new products."
		Now, said Mr Heim, "we managed to turn this platform that was purely focused on equity derivatives products into a cross-asset derivative house".
		The scope of that revamped investment bank has been capped, since 2014, at 20 per cent of SocGen's group-wide capital, reducing the likelihood that the whole of SocGen could ever be rocked by a scandal such as Jérôme Kerviel's $7.2bn rogue trading spree.
		While there are no shortage of former SocGen insiders and rivals to question the bank's recent performance, and its pedigree, it remains Emea's third biggest equities operator, behind only JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.
		"Excellence is the clients' perception. We have a great perception from the clients still," said Mr Cabannes. "Ask the client, not the competition. They are necessarily negative. Don't ask our former colleagues who left the company. They are frustrated."
		One former colleague whose opinion could matter is UniCredit's Mr Mustier, who has been exploring a merger with SocGen. "Jean-Pierre Mustier represents a blessed era for SocGen and he's a man who rebuilt himself after Kerviel, so it's a double seduction," said one person who worked with him at SocGen.
		Shareholder concerns Litigation issues and management shake-up The poor equity-derivatives performance in the first quarter came during one of the bank's more turbulent periods.
		Didier Valet, Séverin Cabannes's predecessor, resigned abruptly in March over the recently settled Libor-manipulation litigation. The bank has also just agreed a settlement with US authorities over another case involving corruption and bribery of the Libyan Investment Authority. A third case to do with sanctions is still pending.
		The litigation overhang had weighed on the stock price, while investors were also questioning the bank's direction under chief executive Frédéric Oudéa.
		These shareholder concerns intensified after a management shake-up precipitated by Mr Valet's departure and the weak first quarter marked by the fading reliance on equity derivatives, which has removed some of SocGen's original identity and selling point.

<titre>Spirited Leicester fight back to stop Racing running riot  Sport Champions Cup</titre>

		Racing 92 36 Leicester 26 Scorer 00, Scorer 00 Att: 16,538
		 The riot-afflicted City of Light has had its share of darkness in recent weeks but Racing 92 and Leicester managed to find a way to illuminate the landscape with a sporting son et lumiere show full of edge and shafts of dazzling rugby.
		A glance at the scoreboard might suggest that Leicester are in the depths of a crisis after their seventh successive defeat. But that was far from the truth.  The Tigers were bold and bright for long stretches, twice reduced to 14 men through yellow cards, never running up the white flag, showing resilience and pluck in much of what they did to take a deserved bonus point for scoring four tries, a lung-busting run from George Ford leading to Adam Thompstone's noble effort 10 minutes from time.
		 Ford was at the centre of all that was good about Leicester, a raging force of defiance. Reports of Leicester's demise are very much on hold, albeit a loss can never be taken lightly. But the bonus point was a fitting reward for hammering at Racing right to the very end.
		"You're never happy with a loss and that game was a real emotional roller coaster," said Geordan Murphy, Leicester's director of rugby. "You can't question the passion and endeavour of the boys."
		Teddy Iribaren, Racing's scrumhalf, was the teasing dynamo and he had any number of willing outriders, be it lock Leone Nakarawa, or wings Simon Zebo and Juan Imhoff. The four-try bonus point was in the bag by the 34th minute and, fittingly at such a space-age indoor arena, the crowd thrilled at the entertainment. Racing 92, beaten finalists twice in the past three years, have their sights set high.
		Leicester, there to be counted as the Racing storm raged all around, made their own impression on a lively match, with Ford orchestrating events alongside the impressive Matt Toomua and Manu Tuilagi. Tuilagi, sent to the sin-bin in the first half as he stuck out a hand to intercept a Racing pass, was in blazing form, his wraparound try early in the second half setting the tone for the Leicester revival.
		On this evidence, there is still a beating pulse at the club, not something that was in evidence last weekend in Bristol.
		There was no time for Leicester to contemplate external battles in protest-plagued Paris, for the simple reason that they have had plenty of their own tussles with which to contend.
		There has been a lot of fuss and kerfuffle around the club in recent times. Several names have been speculatively linked to coaching jobs, be it Mike Ford or, more bizarrely, former England defence coach Paul Gustard, only a few months into his new role at Harlequins. Both Leicester and Quins vehemently reject the notion that Gustard has been approached.
		Leicester have backed Murphy.
		They want their long-standing former full-back to succeed. He has free rein to propose who he might want to bring in, either coaches or players. This display will have boosted his cause.
		"The board have been great and given me whatever support I need," said Murphy. "If someone does come in, it has to be the right fit."
		It did not take long for Racing to show their colours. There was an effervescence about their play right from the first whistle, with Virimi Vakatawa across the try-line within nine minutes.
		 There were any number of sky-blue hooped shirts tracking the action, knowing that opportunity would come their way given the manner in which the halfbacks, Iribaren and Scotland's Finn Russell, were always on the lookout for the killer inside pass. It all duly came to pass, Imhoff touching down in the 13th minute.
		If that second score set alarm bells ringing in Leicester ranks, they responded in wholly the right fashion, full-back Jonah Holmes cutting a lovely angle to get his side on the board. It was a portent that Leicester were not going to be mere witnesses to the Racing spectacle. They did not yield. They had to grasp and clutch at the waves of Racing shirts but they never stopped putting bodies on the line.
		But there was a certain inevitability to that Leicester line being breached, as it was twice more before the interval. Zebo shrugged off the clawing attentions of Harry Wells to cross under the posts, to be followed 10 minutes later by the bonus-point try from flanker Baptiste Chouzenoux.
		At 26-7, Leicester might have folded, but they did not, No 8 Sione Kalamafoni diving through to touch down just before the break.
		Tuilagi skinned Nakarawa for his effort in the 43rd minute. Olivier Klemenczak kept Racing noses in front but Leicester's heartening finale was signposted by a barrelling run from prop Ellis Genge (who had earlier been yellow carded), Ford and Thompstone eventually doing the honours.
